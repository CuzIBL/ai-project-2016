 pictorial  representation - information text - author system intended for work with texts in natural language and simple geometrical compositions. the general principles of the system operation  i t s architecture  and basic problems are discussed. 
introduction 
　　　rita is an experimental software picture - text system intended for operation within the bounds of a most simple  world  of graphic compositions constructed from a small number of elementary geometrical figures. the system is supposed to be capable of: 
- constructing a graphic composition according to a given textual description. 
- composing a sufficiently adequate 	and natural description f o r any geometrical composition. 
　　　it was agreed that both graphic composition and textual descriptions should be  at the opening stage of the project r e a l i zation  as simple as possible. 
　　　composition: one  two  or three circles located on a square screen. the proportions of the circles and their location on the screen  botl absolute and relative 	to each 	other 	arbitrary. 
　　　description: one russian sentence of a maximal number of 1 words  containing no comparisons or metaphors. to make up for the primitive geometrical  world   a reasonably large margin is suggested for the syntactic structure of descriptions. 
principles of system realization 
　　　the system consists of two independently operating parts: 1  language processor or l-processor and 1  composition processor or c-processor  both intended for analysis as well as synthesis. 
　　　the two parts are linked together through an intexmediate level of the semant i c presentation of information  semp    see fig. 1. 

　　　semp  as a matter of fact  is an i n variant corresponding  on the one hand to a sufficiently broad class of synonymous texts  and  on the other hand  to a certain number of compositions; f o r any of these  every text of the class is an acceptable description. apart from this   semp is constructed as a formal object feasible for computer software representat i o n . semp acts as an intermediary language in picture = semp = text transformations. semp  in the rita system  is a directed graph  i t s vertices marked with symbols of elementary  that i s . within the frames of the system in question   senses1*  i . e .  predicates'1 and  objects  and arcs labelled with symbols of relations between the predicates and their arguments  note that predicate arguments may be predicates or objects  whereas vertices marked with object symbols are always terminal ones* . 
　　　the transformations corresponding to the phases of processor operation as i n d i cated by pointers in pig. 1 are not unique in a general case  with the exception of the text *  semp phase . it should be noted 
the system conception is based on a gener a l ideology of linguistic text  =* sense models presented in . 

1 imply that sets of compositions correspond' ing to each of these semp are the same 
but  rather  that this composition belongs to the intersection of these sets; 
	1  since the world we confine 	our-selves to is extremely scanty and simple  sense units that need further semantic decomposition in a more general context may be used as elementary ones. 　　　at the opening stage of system r e a l i zation it was agreed to avoid the morphological analysis and include a l l necessary 
forms of words in the dictionary. 	thus   the sequence of the analysis mode stages is as follows: 
　　　every word of the input sentence processed by the dictionary is replaced by its entry form plus certain number of 
grammar characteristics   i . e . the so-called deep morphological representation of the word  or the word's dmr . the output 
string of the dmr's is an input for the analysis block. the surface analysis transforms the string into a surface syntactic tree  sss . at the deep analysis phase   the sss is made into deep syntactic structure tree  dss . at the last stage of analysis  the dss tree is transformed into a semp. 
　　　the synthesis carries out the reverse function  i . e . transforming the semp into a sentence of the output description. 
that: system architecture 　　　1  the representation of different descriptions by one and the same semp implies that these descriptions correspond to one and the same set of compositions; 
　　　1  the representation of a certain composition by more than one semp does not 　　　a. the l-processor includes 1 main blocks. analysis  synthesis and dictionary. 
　　　while in the analysis mode  the itprocessor executes the standard routines 1 of natural text analysis: the synthesis standard stages are: 
1  transition from semp to a deep syntactic structure  dss  
1  transition from dss to sss 1  transition from sss to dmr string 1  morphological synthesis. 
　　　dictionary: a preliminary study of more than 1 detailed textual descriptions of arbitrary compositions from a chosen class has shown that a dictionary 
of about 1 entries is sufficient for the current stage of the system realisation. 
　　　since the morphological level i s   f o r the time being  excluded from the l-processor  see above   the dictionary may contain as many as 1 entries including a l l paradigms of words.

　　　1  the computational model  of the composition uses a number of simple rela-
tione defined on the set of elementary numerical characteristics of an image  e.g.  the  distance between the 1st circle and the screen bottom edge    radii ratio of the 1nd and 1rd circles   etc.  and state-
ments concerning geometrical properties of image elements  e.g.  the second circle contacts the principal diagonal    the 1st and 1nd circles intersect   etc.   the statements can be either  true  or  false . 
　　　proceeding from given values of certain characteristics and statements  the 
model calculates values of other characteristics and statements  connected with the given ones through a system of  computable  relations. for example  in the picture  = semp transforation  the basic characteristics are the circle and i t s center coordinates. 
　　　1  analysis-synthesis of predicates sets a corresponding between values of statements and composition numerical characteristics and a certain set of elementary predicates which are semp elements. 
　　　1  the predicate f i l t e r operates at the picture=  semp transition stage only. prom the predicate set obtained at the previous stage the f i l t e r with the help of some heuristics selects a  representative  subject whose predicates have to be used as raw material in the semp construction. 
　　　1  assemp: in the analysis mode complex predicates are constructed from the chosen ones. these complex predicates t o gether with some of the elementary predicates which have not been used before are 
made up into a semp which must be   s u f f i ciently adequate  and  minimally redundant . in the synthesis mode the input semp is decomposed into predicates  complex predicates are further decomposed into elementary ones. the set of elementary predicates obtained is passed to the i n put of the synthesis module of the asp block. 
discussion 
　　　the progress of large software systems requires a practical solution of the man-computer dialogue on a human language basis. theoretical and experimental study of both l i n g u i s t i c and software components of a natural language dialogue systems is one of the principal aims of the rita proj e c t . we also wish to confirm or correct our i n i t i a l hypotheses as to what funct i o n a l blocks of the l-processor can be recommended as a standard  preprocessor  f o r a more or less broad class of computer systems. 
　　　the preprocessor of any computer system capable of  understanding  a natural language includes three main components: dictionary  grammar  syntax + morphology   and semantics are defined by the system orientation  grammar being the only system-independent constituent of the preprocessor. 
　　　we believe that the text processing from a sentence to the deep syntactic structure  dss  level may be introduced as a universal block of the preprocessor. this block also defines the formats of the syntactic section of a dictionary entry  which can thus be made standard. 
　　　besides the universal block the preprocessor must contain an interface block of the dss semp transformation. the i n t e r face realisation is entirely dependent on the semp representation methods which  in t h e i r t u r n   must f i t into the user system. it is evident t h a t   f o r the standard part of the preprocessor changeable interface blocks should be supplied  each of them oriented on some specific class of computer systems  automatic management retrieval systems  data banks  e t c .   . 
　　　the semp language of interface determines the other  semantic  part of a d i c tionary entry. so  the computer system  or class of system  determines both the glossary of the preprocessor dictionary and the structure of the semantic part of the entries. 
　　　the l-processor constructed within the framework of the rita system w i l l serve as an experimental test of the r e ported ideology: f i r s t   a certain prototype of the universal part of the preprocessor is made up to the standards a t t a i n able at t h i s stage  second  the operation of t h i s universal part of the preprocessor the complex of the system as a whole. 
　　　as we wish to concentrate our main efforts on t h i s problem the rest of the system is as much  lightened  as possible

i t s  world  being extremely l i m i t e d   the semp level s i m p l i f i e d   a b u i l t - i n learning mechanism renounced  etc. 
　　　however  the propect purposes are not restricted by the problems d i r e c t l y 	associated with the l-processor. in the course of the c-processor elaboration a 
number of problems also arise that require special investigation. 
　　　to grant an example  consider the concept  the circle is in the  screan cor-
ner . moving from text to image  we shall necessarily have to pass over from a f o r mal expression of t h i s oonoept on the semp level to i t s interpretation in a most simple but   r e a l   world of compositions. what sort of interpretations do we mean  let us correlate each with an interpretat i v e function  i-function  the values of which vary from the   f i r m yes  to the  firm no  depending on values of certain parameters. for instance  with the world 
maximally simplified  the effect of other composition elements neglected  the corner and screen sizes   f i x e d     the i-function in our case depends on the three parameters! the two coordinates of the c i r c l e center and i t s radius. to make the i-function useful* we have to develop techniques of t h e i r generation and computer presentation. it offers no particul a r d i f f i c u l t i e s in the case of an i-funct i o n of a few variables; f o r functions of many variables  though  the problem is f a r from t r i v i a l . most probably  the only p o s s i b i l i t y we have is to t r y to find approximation methods f o r i-functions  i . e . ultimately  to replace a complex concept with a super-position of simpler ones. the efforts to elaborate a s u f f i c i e n t l y adequate procedure of such replacement can go in a few different directions: 
　　　1   explanatory dictionary : a r e s t ricted base set of  elementary  concepts is selected. for each non-elementary concepts and therefore is in i t s e l f an explanation  or   d e f i n i t i o n     of a non-elementary concept through elementary ones. the 
evident advantages of the approach 	are that 
　　　 1  the i-functions are forced into a 	 lower l e v e l   where they can be handled without particular d i f f i c u l t i e s and that 
　　　  i i   it enables deep synonymous paraphrasing on semp l e v e l . 
　　　the disadvantage of the approach is that we do not dispose of an objective rocedure of building-up  explanations  although we can imagine an objective pro-
cedure of t h e i r v e r i f i c a t i o n   . the draw-
back is the more troublesome as there are positively no proofs that the explanation technique is powerfull  or  rather  natural  enough to provide a  close  approxi-
mation f o r complex i-functlons of many variables* 
   1  analytical approximation: the r e construction  with analytic methods  of a complex i-function from p a r t i a l data e.g. individual cross-sections* projections  etc. we can also mention the approximation of i-functions of many variables with methods close to those of pattern recognit i o n  when the situation is described as a set of values of simple concepts . 
   1  research in techniques of a  natur a l   foxmation of complex concepts 	from simple ones  close to that in psychic and psychobiologioal mechanisms* 
　　　a combined strategy may prove to be the most o f f i c l e n t one: an explanatory dictionary up to a d e f i n i t e l e v e l   then methods of handling i-functions d i r e c t l y * the search f o r such a strategy and specif i c methods of i t s realization is also 
one of the main problems of the rita project*
