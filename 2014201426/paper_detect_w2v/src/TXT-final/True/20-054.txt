we present an original approach to build rapidly and reliably a 1d description of the environment of a mobile robot by means of passive stereovision using three cameras. 
   this technique has been successfully applied to many indoor scenes and has proved faster than a previously developed binocular stereo technique  while providing more reliable and more accurate results. moreover  the algorithm is highly parallelisable and has indeed been parallelised  thus highly increasing its speed. 
   results showing the construction of the 1d visual map of a complex indoor scene are included. 
1 introduction 
stereovision is a technique to build a three dimensional description 
  f a scene observed from several viewpoints. it is quoted as passive if no additional lighting of the scene  for instance by a laser beam  is irquired. so defined  passive stereovision happens to be very attractive for many applications in robotics  including 1d object recognition and localisation as well as 1d navigation of mobile robots 
   most of the research on passive stereovision has been devoted to binocular vision for which two cameras are observing the same scene from two slightly different viewpoints  see | l | |1| and included refercikeii . presently  following yachida |1|  an increasing number of stud-- are now concerned with trinocular vision in which a third camera is used to simplify the stereovision problem. detailed
