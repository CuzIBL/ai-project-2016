 
starling with a first-order modal conditional logic which allows unlimited nesting of defaults and emheddings into any context analyzable in possibleworlds theory i introduce two simple notions of default reasoning the syntactic notion of  pnorniied  allowed consequence and the semantic notion of  prioritized  allowed entailment i prove that the one is sound and complete relative to the other 
1 	introduction 
the better known accounts of defeasible reasoning are somewhat limited in the expressive power of their object languages this is apparent for example when it comes to formalizing razs   1  prima facie reasons to act which underlie the planning and justification of acts these suggest an analysis in a formalism for expressing defeasible knowledge such as reiters  1j default logic lhat p is a prima facie reason to do a can be thought of as a normal' default rule with the reason p as its prerequisite and as its consequent a sentence expressing that a ought to be done such an analysis runs into a difficulty though in some cases not discussed by raz the very fact that there is a reason to act is itself in turn a 
reason lo act thus jones lateness is a reason for his boss lo fire him and this very fact is in turn a reason for jones lo act it is a reason for him lo arrive on time in the future  assuming of course he doesn't want lo be fired  this second claim cannot be represented in way i ve suggested though since a default rule which represented it would have as us prerequisite a default rule expressing that jones lateness is a prima facie reason for him lo be fired such embedded defaults are not within the scope of reiter s formalism since its default rules are not a part ol us object language they are metalinguistic rules of i nference 
　mccarthy's  circumscription can in principle be used to represent embedded defaults  since it represents default in the object language but in order to represent the 
research supported in part by the nsf and arl 
1m 	n1n-m1t1nic reasoning 
notion that an act ought to be done which prima facie reasons seem to require this formalism will have lo be generalized from classical logic lo some more expressive underlying language 
　it is unlikely that default logic can be extended lo cover embedded defaults circumscription on the other hand can certainly be extended lo more expressive languages  thomason  extends it to montagues intensional logic  but you wonder whether it is not better to start off with a more expressive language formalizing defaults as ceteris paribus conditionals in modal logic since modal conditional logic allows unlimited emheddings of conditionals also prepositional attitudes deontic contexts counterfactuals and other constructions are already quite well understood in that setting 
　this idea was first persued by dclgmnde i1kj others including asher and morreau  and bouuher  1 laler took it up bui their results so far have been disappoinling delgrande had a difficulty which circumscription and default logic do not face wilh what he called 'irrelevant information ' asher & morreau  solved this particular problem but their nonmonotonic consequence notion commonsensc entailment is conceptually exotic and technically formidable bounlier  treated conditionals expressing defaults as necessarily true if true at all this squanders the resources of modal conditional logic for representing nested defaults and emheddings of defaults inio belief contexts and counterfactuals finally these approaches have not led lo attractive syntactic characterizations of nonmonolonic reasoning not even characterizations of the sound-though-incomplete kind which mccarthy  offers 
　in uns paper 1 will present an account of nonmonotonic reasoning based in modal conditional logic which does not have these shortcomings the goal is the same as dial of asher and morreau  lo provide an underpinning for analyses requiring the resources of possible-worlds theory in regard to the inferences it allows the notion of nonmonolonic consequence which i will present here is very similar lo their common sense entailment  though section 1 shows how it allows defeasible inferences including strengthening of conditional antecedents and the hypothetical syllogism whjch have as far as i know nol 

been dealt with before  one important advantage of the present account over commonsense entailment is that it is technically and conceptually simpler for this reason it provides a better foundation for analyses which depend on commonsense entailment  such as lascandes and asher's 
 treatment of rhetorical structure in natural language 
　i begin in the next section with a weak first-order modal conditional logic with which to represent defaults ' in section 1 i present a syntactic notion of nonmonotonic consequence allowed consequence and analyze several familiar patterns of nonmonotonic reasoning in section 1 
1 present allowed entailment which is an analog  in possible-worlds theory of mccarthys  minimal entailment in sections 1 and 1 i generalize these to allow a priority order on defaults and show that  prioritized  allowed consequence is sound and complete relative lo 
 prioritized  allowed entailment 
1 default 	conditionals 
here is a formal language for expressing defaults let l be a countable language of first-order logic with no function 
symbols add a binary conditional operator the result is   where and are formulas of 
familiar monadic modal operators expressing belief  b  knowledge  k  and obligation  o  can be added loo where  p is a formula of so are 
　where and are sentences is intended to express thai normally letting j be an individual tonslanl standing for jones for example letting dyz express that y is a day in month z letting lxy express that x is late tor work on day y and letting fx express that x is fired  is intended lo express 
that other things being equal jones ought to be fired if he is late every day in december this formalizes ihe notion that jones' being lale all december is a prima facie reason lor him lo be fired 
　where and are predicalcs or relations vx  p y  is intended lo express thai if something is  p then normally u is a  for example  letting hxy express that y is an event in which x is thoroughly heated and idling fxy express lhal y is an event in which x will catch fire the monadic predicate  expresses thai x is flammable it is the sort of ihing whilh in ihe event thai n is thoroughly heated will normally catch fire 
　there is something implausible about understanding flammabihty as a universally quantified conditional lhal a piece of wood is flammable wrongly entails that it normally will calch fire in the event thai it is thoroughly healed while say immersed in waler  imagine boiling h for hours on end   there are alternative ways ol understanding flammabihty that a given piece of wood w is flammable clearly has something to do with cvenis in which w is thoroughly heated but inslcad of supposing ihis claim lo quantify over events of this kind u could  say be taken to express that two properties - the property of being an event in which w is heated and lhal of being an 
1 h is neither new nor is it unique to this analysis of non monotonic reasoning delgrande ashcr & morreau and boutihcr all rely on some such underlying conditional logic event in which w catches fire - stand in an appropriate relation to one another the generic dogs bark would on this view express thai the properly of being a dog and being a barking thing stand in this same relation  and so on 
　such a relauonal accounl of defaults can be developed on the basis of a suitable theory of properties and once developed ll will be possible lo extend to it the accounl of nonmonotonic reasoning of sections 1 and 1 but that is lor another time 
　unlimited nesling of   allowed letting ax express that x attempts to arrive at work on time  more of the resources of modal logic could be used lo analyze a further but that would be a distractions here  the following nested sentence expresses lhal the fact that jones' lateness is a reason lo fire him is itself a prima facie reason for him lo try to arrive on time 

　for another example of nesting letting rx express that x ought lto he kept well away from radiators we can write 
 lo express that flammable things 
normally ought to be kept well away from radiators 
what is the meaning of   and what is us logic' as 
delgrande asher & morreau and boutilier all point out in keeping with the intended interpretation of  there is a 
standard axiom scheme of conditional logic which is nol valid modus ponens or it can happen lhal normally if lhal holds and yet that does nol hold these authors helped themselves lo interpretations of conditional logic within possible worlds semantics as pioneered by stalnaker and thomason  and l ewis 1  making suitable adjustments so as to keep modus ponens from being valid i will do the same 
i begin by interprcling  in possible-worlds models 
 which are presented in chellas 1   the basic notion is thai of a possible worlds frame which is a triple  consisting of a nonempty sel #'of possible worlds a sel a of individuals over which ihe quantifiers of  range and a worlds selection function * 
 this latler component which is used to inlerpret   maps each world and proposition onto a proposition {proposition is the technical term for a subset of hl a proposition p holds in a possible world o'jusl in case  thus * wp  is a sel of worlds informally speaking they are the worlds where things are as they normally are il pholds jusl which set this is dep js on ii/ sincc how things normally arc it pcan vary fron me to time and place to place additional structure can added to modal frames in order lo interpret b k o i other modal constructions like counterlactuals what is i eded is quite well known however and i will not discus it here 
see cheilas 1  for details 
　in keeping with its intended purpose * is subject lo a very basic constraint of conditional logic 
factic1ty a frame satisfies facticity if for all 
another familiar constraint is however quile inappropriate in this connection say lhal  entered in a frame if for all 	then 
we have

shows red is a prima facie reason to slop at an intersection additionally  however the law requires drivers to follow the directions of traffic officers  so the fact that an officer directing traffic is waving you on is a reason to pass through an intersection and supposing you are waved on through a red light  the traffic code determines explicitly that the directions of traffic officers take precedence over traffic signs which include lights so in that case you 
ought to ignore the light and follow the directions 
　in this section i will generalize the notion of allowed consequence to take into account priority orders between default conditionals in the next section the notion of allowed entailment will be similarly generalized and i will prove the completeness theorem according 1 which these two notions coincide the first step is to generalize the notion of a focus of attention from a single set of defaults to a linearly ordered  finite  set of such sets or a focal vector

nonmonotonic reasoning needs to be sensitive to the fact lhal some defaults take precedence over others thus to lake the threadbare example when it comes to drawing conclusions about the ability or otherwise of any given 
penguin to fly the default that penguins normally cannot fly takes precedence over the default that birds normally can fly laws  interpreted following ra1  as prima facie reasons to act provide a less familiar example the 
example is of added interest in that in the case of defaults which express prima facie reasons to act which denvc from laws precedence orders do not simply mirror the taxonomic order of the kinds which the defaults are about  as it does in the case of the birds where the default about the subkind 
penguin takes precedence over the default about the kind birds  instead precedence orders are in the legal case often simply declared in legal codes so for example  in virtue of the law which requires this the fact that a traffic light

1 	strengthening conditional antecedents 
allowed consequence and entailment solve a problem aboul reasoning with conditionals which i will now very briefly sketch 
　if shoemaker levy 1 had hit earth then there would have been an explosion equivalent 1 at least 1 megatons ol tnt it seems reasonable to infer that there would have been an explosion of this magnitude if shoemaker-levy 1 had hit earth right after the world-cup final but the logic of conditionals does not support this inference lewis  argues convincingly that the logic of counterfactuals cannot validate the strengthening of conditional antecedents 
　there is also the hypothetical syllogism or transitivity if shoemaker levy 1 had hit earth then there would have been a 1 megaton explosion and if there had been a 1 megaton explosion then life as we know n would have come to an end so  you might ihink if shoemakerlevy 1 had hit earth then life as we know it would have come to an end but again the logic of counlerfactual conditionals offers no support it cannot do since as can easily be shown under minimal assumptions validity of transitivity entails thai counterfactual antecedents can always be strengthened 
let tr be the axiom scheme 
the logic of counterfactuals cannot be allowed to validate tr  but the notion of allowed consequence suggests another way to account for the plausibility of inferences like the examples just mentioned just as in this paper the 
1 	non-monotonic reasoning 
logic of defeasible conditionals was augmented by adding to any given premises as many instances of mp as one consistently can the logic of counterfactual or for that matter any other conditionals can be augmented by adding instances of tr this is achieved by including instances of tr in e then the defeasible notion of allowed consequence can account for reasonable examples of strengthening of the antecedent and the hypothetical syllogism  while unreasonable examples such as inferring the coffee would have lasted good if there had been sugar and diesel oil in it from the coffee would have tasted good if there had been sugar in it arc 'blocked  by background knowledge working through this and other examples in detail is something for another time
