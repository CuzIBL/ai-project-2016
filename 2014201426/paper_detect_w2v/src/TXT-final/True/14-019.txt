　　figure 1 . this shows how each mapping u n i t  large box on r i g h t   controls a set of channels from the retina-based units  bottom  to the object-based u n i t s   t o p   . only a few of the mapping u n i t s and channels are shown. the topmost units respond to combinations of a c t i v e objectbased u n i t s . the meaning of the t r i a n g u l a r symbols is explained in the t e x t . 
1 top-down selection of  a mapping 
　　the meaning of the t r i a n g u l a r symbol in f i g . 1 is quite complex. it stands for two r u l e s : 
　　1. m u l t i p l y the a c t i v i t y level in the r e t i n a based unit by the a c t i v i t y level in the mapping u n i t and send the product to the object-based u n i t . 
　　1. multiply the a c t i v i t y level in the r e t i n a based unit by the a c t i v i t y level in the objectbased unit and send the product to the mapping u n i t . 
　　the f i r s t rule is what causes the appropriate mapping when a single mapping unit is f u l l y active   a c t i v i t y varies from 1 to 1 . the second rule selects a p a r t i c u l a r mapping when the a c t i v i t y of the object-based units is determined top-down. fach possible pairing of an object-
based feature with a retina-based feature of the same general type w i l l send a c t i v i t y to a p a r t i c u l a r mapping. if the object is present in the i n p u t   the  correct  pairings w i l l a l l agree on the same mapping  whereas the   c r o s s - p a i r i n g s   w i l l not agree with one another. so the best way of i n s t a n t i a t i n g the object in the scene w i l l be indicated by the mapping with the greatest total input. this way of using an e x p l i c i t representation of mapping space to accumulate evidence for a p a r t i c u l a r mapping is also used by ballard   1   . 
　　the structure of the connectivity in t h i s network captures the mathematical 	structure of a 
three-dimensional spatial r e l a t i o n s h i p . there ere constraints on the ways in which features r e l a t i v e to one frame can be paired with features r e l a t i v e to another frame if the pairings are to correspond to a single 1-d r e l a t i o n s h i p between the two frames. only c e r t a i n sets of pairings are mathematically consistent  and each of these sets corresponds to a set of channels that are a l l connected to the same mapping u n i t . 
iv simultaneous selection of shape ant mapping 
　　i shall assume that the retina-based representation is r i c h enough to allow a roughly correct segmentation of a   f i g u r e   and also to allow a number of plausible object-based frames to be selected for the candidate figure using bottom-up h e u r i s t i c s . the evidence in favour of an object-based frame provides enough input to the relevant mapping unit to give it a low i n i t i a l level of a c t i v i t y . the pattern of a c t i v i t y in the retina-based units is then mapped through e l l the candidate mappings simultaneously  but because the mapping units are not f u l l y a c t i v e   each mapping is attenuated  see rule 1 above  and so there are many s l i g h t l y active object-based u n i t s . among these objectbased features there w i l l be subsets which can be recognised as p a r t i a l descriptions of f a m i l i a r shapes. 
　　the precise d e t a i l s of how shape descriptions are recognised as f a m i l i a r is not central to the model. in f i g . 1 t h i s mechanism is grossly s i m p l i f i e d and shown as a set of shaperecognition u n i t s . a l l we need to assume is some kind of positive feedback mechanism which provides top-down support for f a m i l i a r combinations of object-based features. so  among the many s l i g h t l y active object-based u n i t s   certain subsets w i l l receive more top-down
