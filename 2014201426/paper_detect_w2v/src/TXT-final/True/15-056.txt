　　　the problem is f i r s t described and the need for an expert system is j u s t i f i e d by the complexi ty of land use in the area as w e l l as the d i f i c u l ty to use s i m u l a t i o n models on time for p r e d i c t i o n 
of damages and for the analysis of the best con-
t r o l d e c i s i o n s . the expert system can synthesize the r e s u l t s of previous analysis w i t h the models 
and the c r i t e r i a of experts and it can be used on real time l i n k e d w i t h an i n f o r m a t i o n system i n c l u ding r a i n i n t e n s i t y data and water levels at cont r o l p o i n t s . 
　　　the contents of the data base of the i n f o r mation system  and the general s p e c i f i c a t i o n of the d i f f e r e n t types of rules are presented. 
       f i n a l l y   the general methodology for the de f i n i t i o n of the rules based on the a r t i f i c i a l ex perience created by a program of runs of the d i f f e r e n t s models for r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of h y d r a u l i c 
behavior is 	discussed.

       one p r a c t i c a l a p p l i c a t i o n of a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e that has awakened the most i n t e r e s t over the l a s t years is that of expert systems. 
       the development of technologies for the sys  tematic treatment of inexact reasoning   s h o r t l i f f e   1     duda  hart and nilsson  1  shafer   1     lowrance  1  and zadeh   1     among others  as w e l l as the c o n s t r u c t i o n of systems  dendral   1     myc i n   1     prospector  1  and rl  1   applied to the w o r l d   has c o n t r i b u t e d to t h i s . however  on 
developing an a p p l i c a t i o n on these l i n e s   a l t h ough having tools a v a i l a b l e  teiresias   1     ops   1     rosie  1   e t c .     the c r i t i c a l problem i s the shaping of knowledge on an issue in a set of rules in such a way that the answers to the d i f f e r e n t questions are coherent enough and adj u s t e d to the a c t u a l knowledge of the problems. 
　　　the personal experience of the author of t h i s paper in some s t i l l u n f i n i s h e d attempts of a p p l i c a t i o n  1  shows that the design of t h i s set of rules is not a simple process and does not necessarily lead to success  not so much be cause of the inadequacy of the concept of expert systems  but because of the d i f f i c u l t y shown by the persons consulted  of shaping t h e i r understanding of an area of knowledge i n t o a s t r u c t u red aggregate of c o n j e c t u r e s . 
       it is therefore considered  that the const r u c t i o n of expert susterns may be simpler in 
areas of knowledge where important t h e o r e t i c a l support can be counted on  by b u i l d i n g the i n f e rence rules i n t e g r a t i n g elements of the d i f f e rent t h e o r e t i c a l supports or as a synthesis of r e s u l t s obtained through the a p p l i c a t i o n of mod e l s . 
       the present paper describes the conceptual framework on which the design of an expert system is based now under study at the m i n i s t r y of public works  which supports the decisions dur i n g a r i s e of water in a floodable r e g i o n . a t t e n t i o n is focused in the d e f i n i t i o n of rules based on a set of mathematical s i m u l a t i o n models of the d i f f e r e n t aspects of behavior  as an e l e ment of previous support. 
1. 	the problem 
       in autumn of 1  important floods took place in the spanish coastal mediterranean r e gions  p o i n t i n g up the needs of t e c h n i c a l i n s trumentation designed to y i e l d real time answers to a series of questions which a r i s e dur i n g the event. in e f f e c t   in the mediterranean area  the i n t e n s i v e e x p l o t a t i o n of land by t o u rism along the coast brings about the existence 
of substructures and b u i l d i n g s that block d r a i nage as w e l l as a g r i c u l t u r a l e x p l o t a t i o n s g i v i n g r i s e to towns near the r i v e r courses. furthermor e   the c l i m a t o l o g i c a l conditions b r i n g l i t t l e 
p r e c i p i t a t i o n very concentrated in time which produces important f l o o d peaks. 
       therefore  	the c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the p r o blem demand a rapid t a k i n g of d e c i s i o n s   given the important concentration in time and  	f u r t h e r -
more  the complexity of land use and the system of h y d r a u l i c s u b s t r u c t u r e s   provided that any dec i s i o n may i n f l u e n c e the general behavior of the 
system  which does away with improvisation since actions which might appear acceptable locally might be un acceptable overall due to the intera♀ 
tion of factors. 
1. 	the system 
　　　in accordance with the preceeding considera tions  the construction is required of a system that gives support to the people responsible for control and c i v i l defense during the flood period in order help them to assess the situation at any 
moment in the places of interest. 
　　　taking into account the spatial structure of the area under study  its present situation and recent evolution  the clasical answer to this de-
mand would be: 
- a data base 
- a knowledge base  able to understand  the va lues of the variables of the data base in ti 
me and space and able to give on time answers to the problematical aspects of the actual situation  and in the intervals of t i -
me in which it is desired to make forecasts. 
1 . 	the data base 
　　　for the purpose of information in the flood area  two subsystems may be distinguished: 
- the hydrographic subsystem  made up of: 
. a catching watershed with large slopes that receives the rain  and can be described by: 
. a set of catchment areas 
. a tree-like network of rapid drainage 
. a low zone  whose axis is the river producing the floods  which can be described as the axis of the river together with a series of floodable pockets connected to the river through the temporary courses created during the flooding. 
the whole is represented in the figure 1. 
j. cuena 1 
- the s o c i a l - t e r r i t o r i a l subsystem made up of the system of towns  agricultural explotations and road/rail networks connecting i t . 
both subsystems occupy the region so that during a flood event the state of the f i r s t produ ces effects on the second  flooding of agricultural explotations  towns  blocking roads and railways  etc . 
the information system should present a picture of both subsystems so that questions can be answered on the effects on the social-territor i a l system. accordingly  the information system should be: 
a simplified geographical information system spatially bounded by the contours of the agricultural explotations  urban areas and catchment areas in the watershed and with the spat i a l definition of the transport network   r a i l -
ways and highways  and the hydraulic network  steep high watershed network and main river in the low zone . 
- a real time information system with: 
. rain intensity in reception areas 
. water levels at control points 
1. 	the knowledge base 
　　　this is made up of the set of inference rules that  utilize the values of the data base and allow us to make pertinent assertions in order to evaluate the present and predictable situa t i ons . 
in principle  these assertions would be: 
- pertinent to technical control: 
. recommendable actions on how to operate flood gates in reservoirs  by-pass channels  etc  including blasting of barriers  roads producing backwaters . 
- pertinent to civil defense: 
. water levels at different c r i t i c a l points 
. alternative paths to the interrupted communi cations 
. evacuation of urban communities 
　　　the knowledge base must permit inferences on this type of declarations: 
. in different spatial locations 
. in different intervals of future time 
　　　due to the need of quick answers it is not possible to use a set of complex simulation models  on line during the flood  but it is possible to build an inference engine that synthesize the knowledge obtained from previous model runs. this inference engine w i l l have three main lines of reasoning: 
. reasoning on the state in every moment t 
. reasoning about the possible future states 
. reasoning about advices of control  proposals of decisions  

1 j. cuena 
- there are two types of rules for reasoning about the state in a time instant: 
. situation rules  sr . they allow the deduction of possible water levels in significant points of the flooded area based on data from control points furnished by the information system. 
. impact rules  ir    for estimating the level of impact in the urban and agricultural areas. they are based on the levels at the s i g n i f i cant and control points and on their relationships with the socioeconomic system. 
- there are three types for reasoning about the future: 
. rain rules  rr  in orden to estimate rain intensity in the near future based on pluviographs shapes and their observed evolution. 
. inflow rules  ifr  to compute the flows at every watershed outlet  from the present state of levels in the reception area and the es timated rain intensities. 
. flood level rules  flr  to deduce the expected water levels at the control points based in the actual state in these points and the possible future evolution in the inflow from the watershed areas. 
all these rules w i l l be defined for fixed future time intervals   i . e . rules of 1 hr  1 hr 
1 hr   
　　　once estimated the water levels at the control points  with different degrees of certainty the expected future levels and impacts at significant points  can be infered using the rules sr and ir  defined for the state at time t. 
- there are two types of control rules: 
. operation rules  or  in order to propose varia tions in the control policy of dams  the blas  ting of obstacles that close the flows in so-
me areas  etc. 
. civil defense rules  cdr  to propose alternative travel paths in transport networks . .etc. 
     the general structure is summarized in f i g . 1. 
1. 	system operation 
the system operates in the following way: 
. a real time information system furnishes the basic data at specified time intervals. from these data the system produces the basic pre  
dicates that represent the premises for the inference engine. 
. based on these premises  real time inferences can be made on the situation of areas uncontrolled by the information system. 
. it is also possible to make inferences on the future situation at the controlled and uncontrolled areas. the time intervals for inference may be chosen among those fixed in the rules   i . e . one couls use 1 min  1 hr  etc... inference rules . the fact of updating the premises at every instant  doesn't imply to repeat a l l the inferential process. it 

1. 	building the knowledge base 
　　　the facts related by every set of rules are complex enough to define the rules only by the criteria of the experts. 
　　　hydraulic engineering offers a set of mathematical methods for modelling the behaviour of water levels at both areas: reception and floodable. the general methodology to define the rules is : 
. use the existing data to calibrate: 
. statistical models of pluviogram structure 
. an analogical model of the catching waters hed areas 
. a numerical integration model of the unsteady flow equations for the floodable area 
. development with the advice of the experts  of a plan of model runs oriented to define the rules 
. definition of the rules based on: 
. the results of the a r t i f i c i a l experience created by the model runs 
. the criteria of the experts evaluating the r e l i a b i l i t y . o f the theory of the mo-

dels and the q u a l i t y of the c a l i b r a t i o n 
. the i n c l u s i o n of complementary r u l e s   by the experts  on impacts  dams operation and c i v i l defense. 
　　　for the d e f i n i t i o n of rules based on simulat i o n r e s u l t s : 
. a frame of discernement w i t h predicates r e presenting the basic facts must be defined 
. each rule must be described in terms of f o r mulae composed of the basic 	facts s p e c i f i e d for the d i f f e r e n t objects 	  r a i n levels 	in 
watershed areas  water levels in c o n t r o l and 
s i g n i f i c a n t p o i n t s   points o f s i g n i f i c a n t i m p a c t s . . .   
. the g r i d of simulated cases of every model must enable to e s t a b l i s h the p o s s i b i l i t y of inference of some basic facts from a composi t i o n of f a c t s . for t h a t   the inspection of the number of simulated cases in which both the antecedent and consequent are s a t i s f i e d compared w i t h the t o t a l cases where some of them is s a t i s f i e d   w i l l allow to take the de c i s i o n to include the rule and the estimat i o n o f i t s s t r e n g t h . 
　　　the rules to forecast the r a i n i n t e n s i t i e s can be b u i l t up by the analysis of a sample of storms time series r e g i s t e r e d in the data base. 
　　　for the representation of the behavior of the watershed area one of two classic simulation 
systems w i l l be used: stanford watershed simulat i o n model iv  1  or swmm  storm water manage-
ment model  	 1  . 
　　　the i n f l o w rules  ifr  and the operation r u les  or  for the dams in the watershed can be 
b u i l t by analysis of the r e s u l t s of runs w i t h the 
watershed s i m u l a t i o n model. 
　　　for the s i m u l a t i o n of the unsteady flow in the floodable area  an i m p l i c i t scheme  1  w i l l 
be used for the numerical i n t e g r a t i o n of the saint venant equations. this numerical model is able to compute the levels in the r i v e r and flood areas at every time i n s t a n t   based on these r e s u l t s is possible to b u i l d the s i t u a t i o n rules  sr  and  by analysis of the r e l a t i o n s h i p s b e t ween the increments of flows from the watershed and the increments of water l e v e l s   it is p o s s i -
b l e to b u i l d the 	flood l e v e l rules 	 flr  	f o r pre d i c t i o n . 
       f i n a l l y by expert analysis of the e v o l u t i o n of water levels and the knowledge of the s i t u a t i o n of the s o c i a l - t e r r i t o r i a l system  the impact rules  ir  and the c i v i l defense rules  cdr  can 
be d e f i n e d .
