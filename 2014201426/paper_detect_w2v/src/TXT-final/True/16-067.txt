 the first-order calculus whose well formed formulas are clauses and whose sole inference rules are factorization  resolution and paramodulation is extended to a many-sorted calculus. as a basis for automated theorem proving  this many-sorted calculus leads to a remarkable reduction of the search space and also to simpler proofs. the soundness and completeness of the new calculus and the sort-theorem  which relates the many-sorted calculus to its one-sorted counterpart  are shown. in addition results about term rewriting and unification in a 
many-sorted calculus are obtained. practical examples and a proof protocol of an automated theorem prover based on the many-sorted calculus are presented. 

1. 	introduction 
sorts are frequently used in practical applications of the f i r s t - o r d e r predicate calculus. for example we write formulas l i k e 
	 i  	
and 	treat 	them 	formally 	as 	abbreviation* for 
  i i   	  . 
we use we.ll sorted formulas because they provide a convenient shorthand notation for ordinary f i r s t - o r d e r formulas. but sorts also inflence  the  deduction* from a given set of well sorted formulas. for instance  if p is a predicate only defined on the sort 
% of integers  we w i l l never perform a 
deduction like  . proofs are s i m p l i f i e d   because a many -sorted calculus is more adapted to a many - sorted theory and hence not surprisingly deduction* which respects sorts as well as the usage of well borted formulas r e f l e c t the everyday usage of predicate logic. 
let us sketch how a many-sorted  mehrsortig  calculus is developed from a given  sound and complete  f i r s t - o r d e r one-sorted  einsortig  calculus: assume we have a set of 
sort symbols  ordered by a given subsort order. variable and function symbols  of our given calculus  are associated with a certain sort symbol. the sort of a term is determined by the sort of i t s outermost symbol. in the construction of well sorted  sortenrecht  formulas  we only allow well sorted terms of a certain domainsort or of a subsort of this domainsort for each argu-
ment position of a function or predicate symbol. 
the inference rule* of the many-sorted calculus are the inference rules of the given calculus  but with the r e s t r i c t i o n that only well *orted formula* can be deduced by an application of the restricted inference rules. starting with well sorted formulas this guarantees that only well sorted formulas are derived in a deduction in the many-sorted calculus. 
taking j. herbrand* thesis  her1  as the starting-point  various many-sorted versions of d i f f e r e n t fir'st-order calculi have been proposed and investigated by a. schmidt 
 sch1 sch1   	h. wang 	 wan1   	p.c.gilmore 
 gil1   t. hailperin  hai1   a. oberschelp  obe1  and a. v. idehon  ide1 . 
the advantages of a many-sorted calculus are well recognized within the f i e l d of automated theorem proving  e.g.  hay1   hen1   . several theorem proving programs are also based on some kind of a many-sorted 

calculus  e.g.  wey1  cha1  bm1  unfortunately without a sound theoretical foundation . as a result of this the works cited above become of practical significance. 
¡¡¡¡most theorem proving programs are based on a f i r s t - o r d e r calculus whose inference rules are factorization  resolution and panamadulate on  rob1  wr1  and whose formulas  called clauses.  are in skolemized conjunctive normal form  lov1 . we c a l l such a calculus an 
in this paper  we shall define the rpcalculus  i . e . a many-sorted version of the rp-calculus  and we shall introduce a notion of e - u n s a t i s f i a b i l i t y of sets of well sorted clauses  called 
obviously we are only interested in a manysorted calculus which is sound and complete  but in addition we can ask: which formulas do we expect as theorems of the 
compared to those of the rp-calculus  to f a c i l i t a t e a comparison between both these c a l c u l i   we represent the relations between the function symbols and the sort symbols as well as the subsort order by the set of sort axioms  sortenaxiome   i . e . a set of f i r s t - o r d e r formulas. for a well sorted formula   as e.g.  i  above  the relativization 
  sortenbeschrankung   relat vierung  of is the unabbreviated version of   as e.g.   i i     where sort symbols are used as unary predicate symbols to express the sort of a variable symbol. now the r e l a t i o n between the rp- and the -calculus can be expressed by the following diagram: 

here s denotes the extension of a set s of well sorted clauses by a l l functionallyreflexive axioms and d denotes the empty clause. denotes a deduction in the erp-calculus and stands for a deduction in the rp-calculus. we assume that the set 
c. walther 1 
of sort axioms is in clausal form and we 
a 
let s denote the set of a l l r e l a t i v i z a t i o n s 
of the well sorted clauses in s. in the diagram   1  and  1  express the soundness and completeness of the the rp-calculus respectively. the equivalences 
  1  and  1  are called the sort-theoicm  sortensatz    1  is i t s modclthe.oke.tic part and  1  i t s proof theroretic. pant. the sort-theorem establishes the connection between both calculi and also shows the advantages we have in using a many-sorted calculus: we obtain a shorter refutation of a smaller set of shorter clauses  when 
proving  instead  e reason is that deductions about s o r t - r e l a t ionships  which are performed e x p l i c i t l y in the one-sorted calculus  are b u i l t into the inference  mechanism in the many-sorted calculus. 
in this paper  we shall show the soundness and completeness of the erp-calculus  1   as well as the modeltheoretic part of the sort-theorem  1   i . e . we show that the above diagram is commutative. we shall also consider term rewriting under sorts because important aspects of paramodulation are related to term r e w r i t i n g . 
we shall demonstrate that the erp-calculus is only complete if it contains a special inference r u l e   the so-called weakening rule. this rule is specific to a many-sorted calculus  because it cannot be applied if only one sort is given  and hence in our formulation the rp-calculus is but a special 
case of the  we also present 
special results about u n i f i c a t i o n under sorts which are necessitated by the weakening r u l e . 
the practical application of the  -calculus in automated theorem proving leads to a drastic reduction of the search space as compared to the rp-calculus. this has been demonstrated by an implementation of the 
erp-calculus in an existing proof procedure

this paper is a shortened version of the technical report  wal1a  to which the reader is referred for the omited proofs. 
1. formal preliminaries 
it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basic terminology of resolution and paramodulation based theorem proving  e.g.  lov1  . 
the rp-calculus let t denote the set of all well formed terms over the alphabet of 
variable.  the alphabet of constant 
symbols c and the alphabet of function symbols f. at  lit  is the set of all well formed atoms  literals  over  and the alphabet of predicate symbols p. 
for each literal l   is the atom of l and  denotes l's complement which is obtained from l by applying  or omiting  the negation sign not. the clause language c is the set of all clauses  a is the empty clause. 
for a set d of terms  literals or clauses  vars  d  is defined as the set of all variable 
symbols in d. the subscript  abbreviates ground  e . g . i s the set of all ground terms . 
when concerned with equality reasoning  we use e as the syntactic equality sign and assume  denotes the extension of the clause set s by all functionally-reflexive axioms the set of all equality atoms is defined as 
sub is the set of all substitutions and e denotes the identity substitution. the domain o f a substitution denoted :   i s the set of all variable symbols x with 
the codomaln of denoted is defined as we say that two substitutions 
denoted 
a  ground  term rewriting system is a set of directed equations 
where we define 

¡¡¡¡we shall also manipulate ground literals by a term rewriting system and extend  ir the obvious way. for a set i of literals  the term rewriting system r i  contained in
i is defined as 
given a variable disjoint set s of clauses and a clause  denotes the existence
of a deduction of c from s  using the inference rules of factorization  resolution and paramodulation. is a deduction without paramodulation and is a deduction without resolution. denotes the set of all ground instances of the clauses in s. 
a  possibly infinite  subset i of  is called an interpretation iff for each lei  
. i is e-closed iff for each l€i and each . i i. an e-interpretation iff i is e-closed and 
be a set of sort 
symbols ordered by the subsort order a p a r t i a l order which is r e f l e x i v e   a n t i symmetric and t r a n s i t i v e . we use as an abbreviation for: such that ther is no s with variable  constant and function symbols are associated with a certain sort symbol  called the rangesort o the respective symbol. the sort   t   of a 
term t is the rangesort of the outermost function  constant or variable symbol of t. 
a l l argument positions of a function or pre dicate symbol are associated with a certain sort symbol called the domalnsort. in the construction of the set of a l l 
 or well sorted terms  and of the set 
	of all 	of the 
                 only those terms may f i l l an argument position of a function or predicat symbol  whose sorts are subsorts of the

the f i r s t column l i s t s the s t a t i s t i c a l values for the proof using the many-sorted calculus the second column l i s t s the values for the one-sorted calculus and the t h i r d column shows the r a t i o between the values of both example runs. 
in the proof s t a t i s t i c s   the value for 'number of links generated' corresponds to the size of the search space the value for  number of steps executed' is a measure of the expense of the actual search and 'level of p r o o f represents the search depth. 
the comparison between the s t a t i s t i c a l values of both protocols immediately reveals the advantages of using an automated theorem prover based on the zrp-calculus. the values are typical for a l l examples  and of course for more complex ones  that have been proved by this system.
