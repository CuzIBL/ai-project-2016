       the p r o p e r t i e s of continuous convex f i g u r e s are w e l l defined and understood1. but a computer  sees  these objects in the form of c e l l u l a r r a t h e r than continuous images  each c e l l h o l d i n g a number t h a t represents the o b j e c t ' s p r o j e c t i o n i n t o t h a t c e l l . 
       hence it is important a  to d e f i n e r i g o r o u s l y the geometric p r o p e r t i e s of c e l l u l a r blobs in terms of the continuous objects of which the c e l l u l a r blobs are images  and b  to develop a l gorithms that t e s t c e l l u l a r blobs f o r these p r o p e r t i e s .

we develop the elements of a theory of convex blobs. in the interest of brevity  the presentation of the theory is partly nonrigorous and i n t u i t i v e . for rigorous proofs  see reference 1. 
statement of the problem 
　　　a figure is defined to be convex if it contains the line segment that joins any two points of the figure. 	otherwise the figure is concave. 
　　　consider the cellular blobs illustrated in figure 1. intuition t e l l s us that blob a is a cellular image of a convex object  and that blob b 
　　　is a cellular image of a concave object. blob a  considered as a continuous figure  is clearly concave  as shown by the dotted line. hence we need to find a reasonable  intuitively satisfying definition of  convex cellular blob.  the properties we believe such a definition must have are discussed in the next two paragraphs. 
　　　we think of  convexity  as a form of  smoothness.  i.e.  the more convex an object i s   the smoother it i s . when we ask whether a cellular image j is convex or concave  we are therefore asking whether the smoothest object q  such that i q  ＊ j  is convex or concave  where lar image of q. thus if we can find any plane figure  say r  such that i   r   - j and such that r is convex  then a l l objects smoother than r  say  such that  w i l l also be convex. 
　　　this leads us to the following preliminary definition of cellular convexity: a cellular blob is convex if and only if there exists at least one convex figure r of which the given cellular blob is an image. 
　　　searching for such an r is not a practical test for convexity  however  because even after an indefinitely long unsuccessful search such an r may s t i l l exist. what we need is an algorithm for constructing an object p  such that i p  ＊ j  and such that if p is concave then every other object 
whose image is j w i l l necessarily be concave  too. we show in theorems 1 to 1 that the  minimumperimeter polygon  answers this need. 
　　　unger's algorithms for detecting  vertical concavity  and  horizontal concavity  are the closest known earlier approaches to the detection of convex cellular b l o b s . it is easy  however  to draw a concave blob that is vertically convex and horizontally convex. such a blob is shown in fig. 1. the dotted line shows that this blob is concave.

elementary concepts of plane figures 	elements of the theory of cellular blobs 

a
 simple curve is defined i n t u i t i v e l y as the 
curve obtained from the continuous motion of a point on a plane  such that the path of the point never crosses or becomes tangent to i t s e l f   except possibly when the path reenters i t s e l f . a simple closed curve is a simple curve which reenters itself. a simple curve may be bounded or unbounded at either of i t s  ends.   for rigorous d e f i n i tions of these e n t i t i e s   see alexandrov1.  if the distance of precisely one of a simple curve's ends from the plane's origin is i n f i n i t e   the curve is singly unbounded; if both of a simple curve's ends are i n f i n i t e l y distant from the o r i g i n   the curve is doubly unbounded. 
　　　a plane figure  or simply a figure  is defined here as a set of points f having the following properties. 
1. f lies in a plane 
1. f 	= 	  where 	is the empty set 
1. f contains a simple curve c which is either closed or doubly unbounded 
1. f contains the interior of c 
1. f contains no point of the exterior of c 
curve c is the boundary of f. 
　　　we usually represent a figure by a lower case character  such as p  q  r. 
　　　a figure is bounded if it lies entirely within some circle of f i n i t e diameter. thus quadrilaterals and ellipses are bounded figures. a 
blob is any bounded figure. 	note that if a 
figure is bounded  i t s boundary must be closed. 
　　　a set of points s is connected if it is nonempty and if every pair of points in s is contained in a simple curve belonging entirely to s. a set of points is simply connected if it is connected and if there exists no figure f whose boundary lies in s  but some point in f does not l i e in s. note that every figure  as we have defined i t   is simply connected  
　　　a polygon is a figure whose boundary contains only straight line segments. thus  in this paper  a rectangle is a polygon  but a quadrilaterial 
with a pair of intersecting opposite sides is not. 
　　　the vertex angle of a polygon is the interior angle between two adjacent edges of the polygon. 
note that a vertex angle lies in one of the open intervals  1 tt    tt  1tt  . 
　　　as a consequence of the definition of convexity  a polygon is convex if and only if each of i t s vertex angles is less than tt radians. hence every triangle is convex. the above observations lead to the following definitions. a vertex of a polygon is a convex vertex if i t s vertex angle is less than it radians; it is a concave vertex if i t s vertex angle exceeds tt radians. 
　　　a cellular mosaic* is a set of bounded convex figures  c }  called cells  such that either or part of the boundary of c for a l l i  j  and such that the union of a l l the cells covers the entire plane. 
　　　a cellular mosaic is illustrated in figure 1. an array of cells which is somewhat like a cellular mosaic  but which violates the convexity requirement  is shown in figure 1. 
　　　let denote cells in a cellular mosaic  q is a neighbor of p if  is a curve of nonzero length. it can be shown that this curve must 
be a straight line segment. hence every c e l l of a cellular mosaic is a convex polygon. 
　　　a cellular map is a nonempty subset of cells of a cellular mosaic. 	a cellular map may consist of just one c e l l . 	note that a cellular map need not be connected  bounded or convex. 
　　　a chain is a sequence of cells each of which is a neighbor of i t s predecessor  i t s successor  or both. a cellular map j is chained if it is nonempty  and if for every pair of cells  a b  in j there exists a chain belonging entirely to j and containing cells a and b. note that if the boundary of the union of the elements of a cellular map j is a simple closed curve  then j is chained. 
　　　a cellular map j is the cellular image  or b r i e f l y the image  of a figure p if and only if 
a  the union of the members of j contains p  and 
b  every member of j containing an exterior point of p also contains a boundary point of p. we use the notation i p  to denote the cellular image of 
p. 
　　　the degree of a polygon is the number of sides it has. 	a minimum-degree polygon of a cellular image j is any polygon p such that i p  = j  and such that there exists no polygon q whose degree is less than that of p and such that i c q   j . 
　　　a minimum perimeter polygon of j is any polyon p such that i p  = j  and such that there exists no polygon q whose perimeter is less than that of p and such that 
　　　the cellular exterior of a cellular figure j is the set consisting of a l l cells not in j. 	j denotes the c e l l exterior of j. 
     boundary of the union of a l l cells of j. clearly lj is the boundary of a polygon  since every c e l l of j is a polygon. at each vertex of 
fej draw a circle of radius e  with e sufficiently 
small so that the circle intersects only the sides forming the vertex. replace every corner of 
*a cellular mosaic is similar  but not identical to  a  topological complex. 1
