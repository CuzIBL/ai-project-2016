1 	introduction 
the management of uncertainty in inference systems is an important issue due to the imperfect nature of real world information. there are several fields in which this information has to do with vague concepts  i.e. concepts without clear definition. the key fact about vague concepts is that while they are not well defined  propositions involving them may be quite well defined. for instance  the boundaries of the mount everest are ill defined  whereas the proposition stating that the mount everest is the highest mountain of the world is definite  and its definiteness is not compromised by the ill-definitess of it's exact boundaries. propositions of this kind are called fuzzy propositions. each fuzzy proposition may have a degree of truth between  1 . on the other hand  there exists propositions which are true or false  but due to the lack of precision of the available information we can in general only estimate to what extend it is possible or necessary that they are true. this kind of propositions are called uncertain propositions. for example  the concept triangle is well defined  but we can only estimate to what extend it is possible that e.g. a shape in a picture is a triangle if the segments are not exactly bounded. certainly  any combination of the two is possible  e.g. uncertain fuzzy propositions are fuzzy propositions for which the available reference information is not precise. 
¡¡in this paper we will concentrate our attention to  certain  fuzzy propositions. in particular  fuzzy proposition we will handle are of the form  a   n   where a is a proposition and n €  1   and have intended meaning  it is certain that the degree of truth of a is at least

n . but  rather mapping  a   n  as usual into true or false  as e.g. in  chen and kundu  1    we will give to it a four-valued semantics. this will be done by mapping  a   n  into an element of 1 t f  where {t}  {/}  1 and {t  /} stand for the four truth values true  false  unknown and contradiction  respectively  as in  levesque. 1 . a first consequence of this semantics is that in certain  useful  circumstances the deduction process is tractable from a computational point of view. a second consequence is that the semantics enables us to deal with inconsistencies as the four-valued logic we will adopt is known to be paraconsistent  see  e.g.  wagner  1  . 
¡¡our four-valued fuzzy semantics has been shown to be useful in the area of content-based retrieval of multimedia data  meghini et a/.  1 . in this context the  semantic  content of e.g. an image region r is described by means of fuzzy propositions like  r represents the mount everest with degree   1 . since images  or any other media  are the subjective work of their authors  contradictions could arise among their content representations  possibly together with domain knowledge   which typically may not be the subject of a belief revision process. 
¡¡this paper is organised as follows. in the next section we will briefly resume some aspects of the four-valued logic we are based on and in section 1 we will extend it to the fuzzy case. in section 1 we will extend our logic by allowing a sort of conditional reasoning1. calculi for deciding entailment will be given for all logics presented and section 1 concludes.

the four-valued logic we will base our work on is essentially  belnap  1; levesque  1 . let c be the language of propositional logic  with connectives a. v and  . we will use metavariable a  b  c ... and p  q  r for propositions and propositional letters  respectively1. negation normal forms  nnf  and conjunctive normal forms  cnf  are defined as usual. 
¡¡a four-valued interpretation x maps a proposition into an element of 1 t f  and has to satisfy the following equa-
