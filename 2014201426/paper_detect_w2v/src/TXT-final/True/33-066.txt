 
　　　understanding a text depends on s reader's a b i l i t y to construct a coherent interpretation that accounts for the statements in the text. however  a given text does not always imply a unique coherent interpretation. in particular  readers can be steered away from an otherwise plausible explanation for a story by such extra-textual factors as the source of the text  the reading purpose  interruptions during reading  or repeated re-questioning of the reader. some of these effects have been observed in experiments in cognitive psychology   e . g .   black  . this paper presents a computer program called macarthur that can vary both the depth and direction of its i n ference pursuit in response to re-questioning  resulting in a series of markedly different interpretations of the same text* 
1  introduction 
consider the following story: 
 the pakistani ambassador to the united states made an unscheduled stop in albania yesterday on his way home to what an aide of the ambassador described as  a working vacation . 
　　　why did the ambassador go to albania  people in informal experiments most often answer that he may have simply gone there as part of his vacation. however  when the same question is repeated  they generate alternative explanations  such as the following: 
1. there could have been some secret p o l i t i c a l meeting there. 
1. there might have been plane trouble; 	say  	an emergency landing to f i x a fuel leak. 
1. maybe he juat wanted to avoid reporters on 	his vacation. 
this research was supported in part 	by 	the 	naval 
ocean systems center under contract n1-c-1. 
　　　the text presents an explanation on the surface  that the ambassador was on vacation   which is adequate to serve as an interpretation of the events in the story. yet re-probing with the same question has the effect of causing people to generate new and  slanted  interpretations  reading more into the passage than before. in a related series of informal experiments  people were told different  sources  of the text; in particular  they were either told that it was excerpted from the new york times  an agatha christie novel  cosmopolitan magazine  a grammar-school history textbook or a jimmy stewart movie. their interpretations of the text varied significantly depending on the stated text source. 
　　　these observations about people's reading behavior agree with experiments in cognitive psychology in which varying the stated reading purpose   e . g .   black   frederiksen    and interposing questions about the text  e.g.  rothkopf and bisbicos  1   anderson and biddle 
  resulted in differences in the inferences that were made by the readers  as evidenced by tests for false recognition of statements corresponding to inferences from the text. 
　　　this paper presents a program called macarthur which is able to redirect its own inference processes when a question about a text is re-asked repeatedly. macarthur demonstrates its successive interpretations by generating english answers to questions about the text. for example  after reading a version of the above story   1     macarthur responds in english to the following sequence of questions: 
q  why did the ambassador go to albania  
a  he went on a vacation in albania and pakistan. 
q  are you sure  why did he go to albania  
a  maybe he wanted to meet with the government of albania  but he wanted to keep it a secret. 
	most existing natural language systems 	 e.g.  
cullingford 	  	wilensky 	  	charniak 
1   do not account for people's a b i l i t y to make different inferences depending on external factors such as re-probing. macarthur models this observed human a b i l i t y by using a hierarchy of understanding processes  some of which  steer  the direction of pursuit of others. 
1. background: correcting erroneous inferences 
1 maintaining a connected representation 
　　　macarthur is an extension of the arthur system  described in granger  1s  1b . that paper pointed out that the process of mapping a story onto a representation is not always straightforward  but rather may require the generation of a number of intermediate representations which are supplanted by the time the final story representation is complete. for example  consider the following simple story  taken from granger  1b : 
 geoffrey huggins walked into the roger sherman movie theater. re went up to the balcony  where willy north was waiting with a gram of cocaine. geoff paid willy in large b i l l s and left quickly. 
why did geoff go into the movie theater  most people infer that he did so in order to buy some coke  since that was the outcome of the story. the alternative possibility  that geoff went to the theater to see a movie and then coincidentally ran into willy and decided to buy some coke from him  seems to go virtually unnoticed. on the basis of pure logic  either of these inferences about geoff's intentions is equally plausible. however  people overwhelmingly infer the former explanation  i . e .   that he went to the theater intending to buy 
coke. 
　　　the problem is that the most plausible i n i t i a l inference from the story's f i r s t sentence is that geoff did go inside to see a movie. hence  selection of the correct inference requires rejection of this i n i t i a l inference. the point is that geoff did not change his mind about why he went into the theater; he had a single intention from the outset. rather it is we  the readers  who must change our minds about our i n i t i a l inference of geoff's intention. arthur is able to understand stories like  because of its a b i l i t y to re-evaluate and supplant its own i n i t i a l inferences in light of subsequent information in a story. 
　　　story  presents us with a different but related d i f f i c u l t y . there is no strong inference in  that causes readers to supplant their i n i t i a l inference; the  vacation  explanation adequately accounts for the statements in the story. however  readers can be steered away from this explanation by external factors such as varying the text source or repeating the same question. the problem macarthur addresses is how external factors like re-probing can affect the inferences a reader 
produces. 
　　　story  describes two events: the ambassador leaves for pakistan on vacation  and then he makes an unscheduled stop in albania. macarthur's interpretation of the f i r s t event simply contains both the stated action of physically leaving and the stated goal of going on a vacation. since changing your location can be part of a known plan for vacationing  macarthur assumes that that is the connection between them. 
　　　macarthur then attempts to find an explanation for the next event  stopping in albania. it f i r s t checks whether the event can be interpreted as part of a plan in service of the already existing goal of vacationing. since going to albania is also a change of location  macarthur assumes that this action too can be interpreted as being part of the vacation. in answer to a question about why the ambassador went to albania  then  macarthur uses this explanation it has constructed to generate the answer that the t r i p was part of the vacation. 
	1 	re-directing 	inference pursuit 
　　　macarthur has arrived at a connected representation for the story  and has answered a question about i t . now the program is  re-probed  with the same question  causing it to re-evalutate its i n i t i a l explanation for the ambassador's going to albania. macarthur finds that albania  in addition to being a location  and therefore the possible site of a vacation   is also a p o l i t i c a l entity. hence  macarthur infers that a t r i p to albania could be part of a plan to meet with members of albania's government. 
　　　now macarthur has a new plausible explanation for the ambassador's action of going to albania  but his action of going to pakistan is s t i l l explained only by the original  vacation  inference. this is   an example of a disconnected representation  i . e .   one in which the explanations for the events of a story are not connected to each other. the current explanation would result in macarthur answering that the ambassador went to 
albania to confer with the government  but that he went to pakistan to vacation. although there is nothing wrong with this on the basis of pure logic  it does not at a l l correspond to the inferences 
people make at this point. 
　　　it is important to note that the  vacation  explanation is not explicitly contradicted by the new explanation; it just fails to be connected to i t . granger  1b  hypothesized that people attempt to connect the pieces of a representation according to the  parsimony principle   which states that the best goal inference is one which accounts for the most actions of an actor. hence  the best story representation is one which contains the fewest number of context inferences to explain the most events in the story. 
　　　the correct representation should  therefore  connect the ambassador's intention of conferring 
with the albanian government together with both his action of travelling to albania  and his announced vacation t r i p to pakistan. to achieve this connection  macarthur infers that the ambassador may have had a constraint on his goal  of keeping his albanian meeting secret. a known method of keeping an event secret is to create a  cover story  for the event  i . e .   an alternative explanation that can account for the covert action. in this case  macarthur assumes that the ambassador announced that he was going on vacation as a cover story for his t r i p to albania.  the structure of cover stories and macarthur's a b i l i t y to recognise them is elaborated in section 1.  
1 
　　　macarthur's representation of the story now consists of a single inference about the ambassador's intentions  he wanted to confer with the albanian government in secret   and a plan in service of that goal  going to albania ; along with the announced  cover story  about going on vacation  in service of the  secrecy  constraint. the i n i t i a l goal inference that the ambassador actually i n tended to go on vacation has now been supplanted: it is no longer considered to be the explanation for the events in the story. 
1 	experimental evidence of effects on inference 
　　　a number of experiments in cognitive psychology have demonstrated that people's reading behavior can be significantly affected by conditions independent of the content of the text itself   e . g .   anderson and biddle   frederiksen   black   haberlandt and bingham   rothkopf and bisbicos  . for instance  reading an assigned text on which you may be tested can result in quite different behavior than reading the same text out of pure interest in the topic  reading it to attempt to c r i t i c i s e i t   reading it becauae your brother wrote i t   etc. 
	in particular  frederiksen 	 	and 	black 
 have supported the hypothesis that people make more inferences  and different types of i n ferences  depending on the purpose they are given by the experimenter for reading the text. black for example notes that people make more inferences when asked to read a passage in preparation for a subsequent memory test than when they are asked to read it in order to simply rate it for  comprehens i b i l i t y   . since the latter task is  shallower   it requires less of what black terms  elaborative  inference  inferences above and beyond s t r i c t l y logical deductions . 
　　　black also notes that when subjects were asked to read the passage for the purpose of later w r i t ing an essay that uses the main point of the passage  they tended to make more inferences that related specifically to the main point of the passage  although they did not make more elaborative inferences overall than the subjects who were to be tested for their memory for the passage. this strongly implies that a stated purpose for reading a text can cause a reader not only to suppress or accelerate his inference processes  but also to steer the direction of pursuit of the inferences that are generated. 
　　　to illustrate this another way  consider using story   the ambassador story  as the text for a similar experiment. since this text is more diff i c u l t to arrive at a single explanation for  the results might show  shallow  readers inferring the  naive  interpretation of the story  i . e .   that the ambassador was just going on vacation  while  deeper  readers might infer one of the alternative interpretations  e.g.  that there was a secret meeting in albania. this would demonstrate that deeper reading tasks could result in different i n ferences  not just more inferences  being generated from a single text. 
　　　macarthur's ability to re-direct its own i n ferences is designed to model people's observed reading behavior in similar tasks. the model is intended to provide a test-bed for comparing implementations of our theories about people's reading behavior with actual experimental evidence. towards this end  section 1 of this paper proposes some possible new experiments and possible extensions to macarthur. 
1. operation of the macarthur program 
	1 	annotated run-time output 
　　　the following represents actual annotated run-time output of the macarthur program. the input to the program is the conceptual dependency representation  schank and abelson   of the following story: 
 dr. fitzsimmons yawned loudly. he left carney and samuelson and went into the next room. he opened the refrigerator. 
macarthur generates inferences connecting the f i r s t two statements  inferring that fitzsimmons is tired and may be about to go to bed. the following  extremely abridged  macarthur output is generated from the processing of the third conceptualization and subsequent questions.

macarthur generates an answer to the question by using i t s current explanation-graph to f i n d the goal f o r t h i s a c t i o n . it also mentions the intermediate inferences in the connective chain from event to g o a l .  macarthur's english generation a l g o r i t h m is taken from arthur's  described in granger  1a .   note: the   e x p l a n a t i o n shape  reported here as  pursued e s i r e d - s t a t e   is one of four such categories of explanations that macarthur knows about. these are explained in section 1 . 1 .

       when macarthur attempts to r e - e x p l a i n a story because of r e - p r o b i n g   it uses a c l a s s i f i c a t i o n scheme f o r d i s c e r n i n g the  shape  of an explanat i o n   which aids i t i n s e l e c t i n g a l t e r n a t i v e exp l a n a t i o n s . this scheme is s t i l l the subject of ongoing research  but it has proved u s e f u l in macarthur's e x p l a n a t i o n s e l e c t i o n a l g o r i t h m . f o l lowing is a l i s t of some of the shapes macarthur c u r r e n t l y knows about. this is not intended to be a complete l i s t   it simply r e f l e c t s the present s t a t e of our a n a l y s i s :

attempting to supplant explanation: 
macarthur uses i t s c l a s s i f i c a t i o n of explanat i o n s i n t o shapes  see section 1  to generate an a l t e r n a t i v e g o a l   that fitzsimmons wants to stay awake  i . e .   to avoid s l e e p i n g . it then attempts to r e - e x p l a i n the events of the s t o r y in terms of t h i s new g o a l   thereby supplanting the previous goal e x p l a n a t i o n . this requires macarthur to f i n d connections between the s t o r y events and the new g o a l .

construct a  cover story ; i . e .   an alternative connected explanation for his actions vhich can serve as an   a l i b i   to any observers. complete understanding of such stories involves the a b i l i t y to maintain separate belief spaces for different characters  and to recognise deception via conflicting beliefs held by d i f ferent characters. 
　　　now we w i l l illustrate how these explanation shapes can give rise to a series of alternative interpretations of stories. recall story : 
 the pakistani ambassador to the united states made an unscheduled stop in albania yesterday on his way home to what an aide of the ambassador described as  a working vacation . 
the four alternative explanations given for this story at the beginning of this paper can now be categorised by explanation shape: 
1. he may have gone there as part of his vacation.  pursue-desired-state  
1. there could have been some secret p o l i t i c a l meeting there.  cover-story  
1. there might have been plane trouble; say an emergency landing.  accident-reaction  
1. maybe he just wanted to avoid reporters on his vacation.  avoid-undesirable-state  
now recall story : 
 dr. fitssimmons yawned loudly. he left carney and samuelson and went into the next room. he opened the refrigerator. 
following are four differently-shaped explanations for this story   two of which correspond to explanations generated by macarthur in section 1 : 
1. maybe he wanted to make some warm milk to help him get to sleep.  pursue-desired-state  
1. maybe he wanted to make some coffee to help him stay awake.  avoid-undesirable-state  
1. maybe he heard something f a l l down in there and he went to investigate.  accident-reaction  
1. maybe he actually had some secret reaaon for going in there  so he yawned to pretend he was tired.  cover-story  
the next section describes the processes by which macarthur uses its knowledge of explanation shapes to generate alternative interpretations of a story when re-probed. 
1. the processes underlying inference re-direction 1 hypothesis-selection and hypothesis-pursuit 
　　　understanding a story or situation often requires us to generate a hypothesis about the goals of the participants  on the basis of their observed actions  selection ; and then to attempt to continue to explain subsequent actions in terms of the hypothesized goals  pursuit . any sufficiently d i f f i c u l t text can suggest multiple alternative explanations  and the reader must select one and pursue i t   but he must also be ready to supplant an i n i t i a l hypothesis with a new one in light of subsequent information. 
1 	pursuing hypotheses 
　　　macarthur's understanding algorithm essentially consists of attempting to explain a l l of the conceptualisations in a text in terms of a minimum number of hypotheses  in accordance with the  parsimony principle   granger  1b  . for example  in attempting to connect up a new story event with an existing hypothesis about a character's goal  macarthur begins by pursuing the goal hypothesis  attempting to integrate the event into the hypothesis  via the following steps: 
1. search for existing  indexed inference paths   see granger  1a    which correspond to pre-stored inferential paths that can serve to connect the hypothesis with the statement; 
1. search known preconditions of the goal for matches with the event; 
1. generate bottom-up indexed inferences from the event to see if any can match existing inference paths to the goal. 
1 supplanting hypotheses 
　　　if these steps f a i l   then macarthur may decide to supplant the current hypothesis with a new one; i . e .   abandon its pursuit of the hypothesis  and select an alternative hypothesis to explain the  recalcitrant  event. this process is described in detail in granger  1b . 
1. generate alternative hypothesis by choosing different explanation-shape; 
1. attempt to explain previous events in terms of new hypothesis  via rules of pursuit. 
1 leaving loose ends 
1 　　　if the procedures above f a i l to re-explain the events in terms of the new hypothesis  then macarthur is in the situation of having two competing hypotheses  the i n i t i a l one and the new one  neither of which can explain a l l of the events in the story. this implies that each of the hypotheses has run into one or more  recalcitrant  events. in this caae  macarthur tentatively admits defeat by reverting back to the i n i t i a l hypothesis  and marking its recalcitrant event as a  loose end  relative to the hypothesis; i . e .   an event that cannot be explained by the existing hypothesis. similarly  the alternative hypothesis is maintained  and its recalcitrant events are also marked as loose ends relative to this hypothesis: 
1. mark recalcitrant events as loose ends relative to new hypothesis; 
1. reinstate i n i t i a l hypothesis; 
1. mark its recalcitrant events as loose ends relative to i t . 
when macarthur leaves a loose end  it then has a disconnected explanation. hence  loose ends result in macarthur s interpretation of the story being less than maximally parsimonious.  this paper has not shown any examples of macarthur leaving a loose end.  
1 	re-shaping explanations 
　　　once macarthur has arrived at a complete explanation for a story  then it can answer questions that refer to the explanation  such as  why questions asking about characters goals. macarthur's processes of searching its explanation to provide an answer  and then generating that answer in english  are similar to those used by arthur  as described in granger  1a . however  macarthur has the additional a b i l i t y to re-explain a story in response to repetition of a question. this requires selection of a new hypothesis as a starting point for the new explanation. macarthur does this by f i r s t selecting a shape different from the current explanation shape  and then letting that shape suggest a new goal hypothesis: 
1. choose alternative explantion shape; 
1. use new 	shape 	to 	generate 	alternative 	goal hypothesis; 
1. attempt to replace existing hypothesis with new hypothesis via rules of supplanting. 
table 1  below  illustrates a few examples of the knowledge macarthur uses to construct a goal explanation for a given event conforming to particular shapes. for each of these event/shape pairs  examples abound. for example  the pair  ptrams/cover-st1ry  corresponds to the  secret meeting  explanation of story   1     the pair 
 propel/accident-reaction  could arise if z propeled x towards w  but it went to y instead; 
z's observed action of propeling x to y might be inexplicable without reference to some possible   s k i l l failure  on z's part. similarly  the pair 
 ingest/accident-reaction  could arise if z ingested something that he wouldn't have ingested had he known what it was; e.g.  poison disguised as chocolate. one more: the pair 
 atrans/avoid-state : z could have given x to y not because he wanted y to have it particularly  but because he  z  wanted not to have x  because of some negative attribute; e.g.  x is a tv and it distracts him from his work  so he wanted to get rid of i t . the pursue-state explanations correspond mostly to likely default reasons for the event being explained  e.g. going somewhere  ptrans  because you want to make use of some known function of the location  such as going to a singles bar to meet someone or going to a store to buy something.

1. conclusions: proposals for further research 1 focperjmeius  on inference re-direction 
　　　black's  experiments on the effects of reading purpose on memory for text assumed that the task of rating the comprehensibility of a text was 
 a 'shallow' task   preparing for a memory test was  a 'deeper' task   and preparing for an essay test in which the subjects would have to make use of the main point of the text was  a 'deepest' task   p. 1 . black's i n i t i a l prediction was basically that the  deeper  the reading purpose  the greater the number of inferences the subject would produce  as evidenced by the number of false recognitions exhibited on tested inference items. 
　　　the actual results of the experiment indicated that the memory task caused the most false recognitions of inference items  while the essay task came second and the comprehensibility task came lowest  as expected. a post-hoc analysis of the recognition test items revealed that the essay task caused significantly more false recognitions than the other two groups on inference items which were  related- to the main point'' of the jj&♀x  even though the number of false recognitions overall   i . e .   including items both related and unrelated to the main point  was lower for the essay task than for the memory task. 
　　　in other words  the experiment was looking for a monotonieslly increasing effect of more inferences corresponding to  deeper*' processing. however  what it found was a difference in not only the  depth   but also in the  direction  of inferences generated. in particular  black acknowledges the existence of  main-point oriented  processing in the essay task which did not appear in the other two tasks. 
　　　consider a similar set of experiments performed using more d i f f i c u l t stories  i . e .   stories that are less strongly connected to a single main point than the essays used in black's study. for example  texts like  and  in this paper could be used. as noted by many researchers  e.g. haberlandt and bingham   black and bern    readers tend to work at finding connections among sentences in a text  even when such connections are not obvious. hence we predict that subjects would dutifully generate connective i n ferences to explain the sentences in a nonstraightforward text like  and   1     but since there are a number of different alternative interpretations of texts like these  different explanations might be produced by different subjects  perhaps as a function of different types of external factors such as reading purpose  text source  interposed questions and re-probing. for example  in a reading-purpose experiment the  shallower  readers might generate a  naive  interpretation of a d i f f i c u l t text; while deeper readers might generate not just more inferences but different i n ferences  corresponding to their significantly different interpretation of the text. 
　　　we respectfully propose such a set of experiments  designed around non-straightforward texts  and making use of other types of extra-textual factors than just reading purpose; in particular  the effects of interposed questions and re-probing. some questions that might be resolved by these experiments include the following: 
1. do peoples' alternative explanations correspond well with the classification of explanations into different  shapes   as proposed in section 
1   and/or with other inference classifications such as the three binary classifications  derived/elaborative  local/global and few-steps/many-steps  proposed 
by black   
1. do certain categories of explanations correspond to longer reading times  
1. do certain categories of explanations correspond to better recognition or recall for the stories later on  
1. are there any observed regularities in the order in which people generate certain categories of explanations in response to reprobing  
there are certainly many other interesting issues dealing with people's inferencing and story-explanation a b i l i t i e s ; this l i s t is just meant to be suggestive of some issues that might be able to be resolved by the experiments proposed here. 
1 proposed e x t e n d s to macarthur 
　　　macarthur can generate alternative explanations for a given text in response to repeated questioning about a particular point in the text. this paper has mentioned a number of types of external factors that can influence the inferences generated from a text  and thereby can give rise to alternative explanations for a text  e.g.  text source  interposed questions  re-probing  and 
varying reading purpose. 
　　　it is not clear how to construct a computer model corresponding to the situations of giving a reader a specified reading purpose nor a specified text source  since most of the task would be to build enough knowledge into the program to model people's extensive knowledge of different particular text sources and of the intricacies associated with certain reading purposes. however  the issue of interposing questions at various points in the middle of the text is one which potentially could be modelled. we plan to investigate the literature of experiments in this area  and hope to extend macarthur to model the effects of interposed questions on people's inference generation and explanation of stories.
