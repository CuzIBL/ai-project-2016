	i 	introduction 
　　　　this paper is a r e p o r t on work in progress at the u n i v e r s i t y h o s p i t a l of geneva. it describes a general parser f o r french developed as p a r t of a 
　　　　p r o j e c t to design a n a t u r a l language i n t e r f a c e f o r a data base system. the o r i g i n a l i t y of t h i s parser l i e s both i n i t s l i n g u i s t i c foundations and i n the 
way they have been implemented. the grammar on which t h i s work is based is an a d a p t a t i o n of chomsky's government-binding theory  cf. chomsky  1  . it can be viewed as a system of components and a system of p r i n c i p l e s f a l l i n g i n t o various subsystems such as the x t h e o r y   the t h e t a t h e o r y   the b i n d i n g t h e o r y   c o n t r o l   government  e t c . there is a l a r g e amount of i n t e r a c t i o n among these subsystems  as w e l l as between the subsystems and the r u l e components  leading to the i n t r i c a t e system of the grammar. 
　　　　the modular conception of the grammar was c a r r i e d over to the p a r s e r   which c o n s i s t s of s e v e r a l procedures corresponding to subtheories of the grammar. this approach makes it p o s s i b l e to break the a n a l y s i s i n t o d i s t i n c t tasks which can be achieved f o l l o w i n g d i f f e r e n t s t r a t e g i e s . 
　　　　this paper is organized as f o l l o w s : the next s e c t i o n concerns the s p e c i f i c a t i o n s of the grammar. section 1 gives an overview of the parser and presents some examples of grammatical c o n s t r u c t i o n s t h a t the parser handles at the present stage. f i n a l l y   the v a r i o u s s y n t a c t i c procedures are d i s cussed in s e c t i o n 1.

	ii 	linguistic specifications 
　　　　an important f e a t u r e of our approach is the c e n t r a l r o l e o f the l e x i c o n . f o l l o w i n g the s p i r i t of chomsky's p r o j e c t i o n p r i n c i p l e   we assume t h a t the s t r u c t u r e of a sentence is e s s e n t i a l l y a 
p r o j e c t i o n o f the l e x i c a l s p e c i f i c a t i o n s o f i t s elements. furthermore  we assume t h a t the range of p o s s i b l e n o n - t e r m i n a l c a t e g o r i e s i s l a r g e l y r e s t r i c t e d t o p r o j e c t i o n s o f the l e x i c a l c a t e g o r i e s n  v  a and p  in accordance w i t h the x system. 
we also make use of the r e s u l t s of t r a c e t h e o r y . 
　　　　we have adopted a v e r s i o n of the x theory according to which a n o n - t e r m i n a l category  say v dominates i t s head  v  and two   p o s s i b l y empty  sets of c o n s t i t u e n t s : spec v  the s p e c i f i e r system of v  and comp v  the complement system of v   . compl v is completely determined by the l e x i c a l f e a t u r e s of v   i . e . the s u b c a t e g o r i z a t i o n features . as f o r the spec v set of c o n s t i t u e n t s   we take it to be an inherent p r o p e r t y of the given category. thus  f o r i n s t a n c e   we w i l l take a u x i l i a r i e s and c l i t i c pronouns to be p a r t of the s p e c i f i e r of v. s i m i l a r l y   the s p e c i f i e r o f n w i l l i n c l u d e d e t e r miners  a d j e c t i v e s   e t c . 
　　　　as f o r the morphological component  we assume i t t o b e i n t e r n a l t o the l e x i c o n   which i s s t r u c tured in such a way as to minimize redundancy. 
	the grammar contains 	: 
          i  a l e x i c o n   which includes a l i s t of a l l the words   i n c l u d i n g compounds  of the language  along w i t h t h e i r categoria 1   m o r p h o l o g i c a l   s y n t a c t i c and semantic f e a t u r e s . 
　　　　  i i   	a p h r a s e - s t r u c t u r e component  which s p e c i f i e s the set o f p o s s i b l e s t r u c t u r e s o f the language. 	it is to a l a r g e e x t e n t redundant w i t h the l e x i c a l i n f o r m a t i o n 	  i . e . 	the s u b c a t e g o r i z a t i o n f e a t u r e s   .

i l l overview of the parser 
　　　　the parser reads a sentence and r e t u r n s the set of p o s s i b l e analyses f o r t h i s sentence.the analyses are given both in a phrase s t r u c t u r e representat i o n  using the f a m i l i a r l a b e l l e d b r a c k e t i n g n o t a t i o n   and in a f u n c t i o n a l s t r u c t u r e r e p r e s e n t a t i o n . the former  which corresponds to an anotated surface s t r u c t u r e   emphazises the s t r u c t u r a l r e l a t i o n s between c o n s t i t u e n t s   w h i l e the l a t t e r emphasizes the grammatical f u n c t i o n s . an i l l u s t r a t i o n is given in  1    where a is the i n p u t sentence  b the phrase s t r u c t u r e and c the f u n c t i o n a l s t r u c t u r e :

　　　　the parser can handle a s u b s t a n t i a l number of grammatical c o n s t r u c t i o n s   i n c l u d i n g wh and yes/ no q u e s t i o n s   i m p e r a t i v e s   r e l a t i v e clauses   tough-movement  tensed and i n f i n i t i v a l s e n t e n t i a l complements  passives  several cases of coordinat i o n   c l i t i c pronouns  causatives  e t c . some of these c o n s t r u c t i o n s are i l l u s t r a t e d in the p r i n t o u t given in f i g u r e 1 below  where a is the input sentence and b the s y n t a c t i c s t r u c t u r e provided by the parser. for reason of space  the f u n c t i o n a l s t r u c t u r e s have been removed. 
　　　　example   1     'has he given them to h i m '   contains three c l i t i c pronouns  l e s   l u i and i l . a l l three of them are coindexed w i t h a t r a c e in argument p o s i t i o n . les is coindexed w i t h an np trace in d i r e c t o b j e c t p o s i t i o n   l u i w i t h a pp t r a c e in i n d i r e c t o b j e c t p o s i t i o n and il w i t h an np t r a c e i n subject p o s i t i o n . 


       the functional structure not only provides the l i s t of arguments ordered with respect to their grammatical function  it also specifies the type of sentence  interrogative  negative  etc.  as well as tense  mood and voice of the verbs. the element e  in  lb  stands for 'trace' and the indices represent the binding relations . 
　　　　sentence   1     'which book has jean persuaded marie to give to p a u l ' is an example of long d i s tance dependency. the wh-element quel l i v r e is l i n k e d to a trace in the d i r e c t o b j e c t p o s i t i o n of the embedded sentence. i t i s   t h e r e f o r e i n t e r p r e t e d as the d i r e c t o b j e c t of donner. n o t i c e   a l s o   t h a t the d i r e c t o b j e c t of persuader c o n t r o l s the empty subject o f the i n f i n i t i v a l sentence. 
　　　　f i n a l l y   in  1  we have an example of ambiguous sentence. in f a c t   t h i s sentence has the pecul i a r p r o p e r t y t h a t each one of i t s words is ambiguous : le and la can be determiners or pronouns  b e l l e is an a d j e c t i v e or a noun  ferme a noun or a v e r b   v o i l e a noun or a verb. among the numerous p o t e n t i a l combinations  the parser c o r r e c t l y r e turned only two s t r u c t u r e s :  1bl  ' t h e beauty closed the v e i l ' and  1  ' t h e nice farm is h i d i n g i f .

	iv 	the syntactic analysis 
       the analysis can be sketched as follows : f i r s t   a lexical analysis of the input sentence is 
performed. it produces a chart data structure  in the sense of kaplan  1  consisting of n+1 vertices  where n is the number of words  related by as many edges as there are readings of the words.in other words  each edge in the chart corresponds to a particular reading and bears a l l the lexical information relevant to i t . 
       the chart then undergoes the syntactic analysis  which is divided into several distinct procedures corresponding to the different components of the grammar described in section 1. 
       the reduction process  which roughly corresponds to the phrase-structure component consists of two procedures. a f i r s t procedure takes care of lexical heads such as n  v and adj and builds up respectively np  vp and ap constituents combining the head and i t s specifier system. this f i r s t step is achieved by means of a predictive analysis. as for the second procedure  it attempts to reduce these constituents into larger and larger constituents u n t i l it reaches the top level. the strategy  this time  is s t r i c l t y bottom-up. 
       the rationale for this division between a bottom-up analysis for the complement systems and a predictive analysis for the specifier systems is based on a very interesting property of the grammar of french  and presumably of many other natural 
languages . verbs  nouns and adjectives take essentially the same range of complements  i.e.pps  ss  nps   a property which leads to potential ambiguities. on the other hand  they usually have distinct specifier systems. this l a t t e r property makes a predictive analysis both convenient and appropriate. 
       edges corresponding to non-terminal categories inherit the lexical specifications of their lexical heads. they also have registers in which both the phrase structure and the functional structure are b u i l t . each syntactic rule is associated with a set of conditions and a set of actions. the conditions verify that the rule is compatible with the features of the constituents to be combined. a typical example of a condition is number and gender agreement. another example is the condition on interpretation. this condition states  for instance  that a vp and an np can only be combined into a larger vp if there is a possible interpretation for np in vp. this rules out attempts to build a transitive structure with an intransitive verb. 
       the actions associated with a rule specify the effect of the rule on the phrase structure and on the functional structure. thus  if the rule combines a vp and an np  the action specifies  i  that the np has to be inserted in the phrase structure as a daughter of vp  and  ii  that it w i l l f i l l up the direct object slot in the functional structure. 
       the binding procedure takes care of elements which are not in argument positions and assigns them an interpretation. following standard practice in generative grammar  grammatical functions are determined on the basis of structural properties. thus  for instance  subject is defined as np immediately dominated by s  object as np immediately dominated by vp  and so on  cf. chomsy  1 . 
these positions are called argument positions. however  there are cases where a constituent interpreted  say  as a direct object does not appear in the canonical position for direct object. this is typically the case of question words and c l i t i c 
pronouns. following the s p i r i t of trace theory  we assume that these constituents get their interpretation through the binding of an empty category   i . e . a 'trace'  in argument position.in the phrase structure representation this binding relation is expressed by means of coindexing. 
       the binding procedure works like t h i s . take the case of wh-binding. the procedure is activated by the rule combining a wh-element and a sentence. the procedure looks for an appropriate slot in the functional structure associated with the s edge. if there is such a slot  an empty element is created and inserted both in the phrase structure and in the functional structure. in case there is no appropriate slot in the matrix sentence  or if the slot is an optional one  the search continues in the next embedded s. 
       to give a concrete example  suppose that we have a wh-word  such as qui  'who'  and an adjacent sentence  such as est-ce que jean a rencontre  'has john met' . the functional structure attached to the sentence contains the argument slots specified in the lexical properties of the lexical head of the sentence  that is the verb rencontrer  'to meet' . this follows from the projection principle. since this verb is transitive  the functional structure contains two slots : a subject slot f i l l e d by the np jean  and a direct object slot  which has not yet been satisfied. because this empty slot is compatible with the wh-word  the binding procedure assigns it an empty category   npnp e  bound  i.e. coindexed  to the wh-word. 
       notice that  since a new edge combining a wh-element and an s can only be created if a trace can be assigned to the wh-element  the procedure guarantees that no wh-elements in a given structure are l e f t uninterpreted. the search for an appropriate slot is interrupted if there is an intervening comp position containing a wh-word  or if the embedded s is dominated by an np node. in other words  chomsky's subjacency condition is b u i l t into the procedure. 
       the binding procedure applies in a very similar fashion in structures containing c l i t i c pronouns. like wh-words  c l i t i c pronouns do not occur in argument position and must  therefore  bind a trace in order to get an interpretation. 

　　　　the c o n t r o l procedure takes care of the cont r o l phenomenon  i . e . the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n o f the s u b j e c t o f i n f i n i t i v a l sentences. i t i s well-known t h a t in the f o l l o w i n g examples the subject of the i n f i n i t i v a l verb is i n t e r p r e t e d as being jean in  1a  and marie in  1b  : 
	 1  	a. jean a promis a marie de p a r t i r . 
'jean promised marie to leave' 
b. jean a persuade  marie de p a r t i r . 
'jean persuaded marie to leave' 
　　　　following again standard assumptions in generative grammar  we assume t h a t an i n f i n i t i v a l complement has e s s e n t i a l l y the same s t r u c t u r e as a tensed complement  namely a s e n t e n t i a l s t r u c t u r e . however  whereas tensed sentences u s u a l l y have l e x i c a l s u b j e c t s   i n f i n i t i v a l sentences e x h i b i t a n empty s u b j e c t . this empty category  commonly r e f e r r e d to as pro  is i n t e r p r e t e d e i t h e r as cor e f e r e n t i a l w i t h an argument oi the; matrix verb 
  as in   1       or as a r b i t r a r y in r e f e r e n c e   dependi n g on the l e x i c a l p r o p e r t i e s of the m a t r i x v e r b . a c t i v a t e d by the r u l e a t t a c h i n g an i n f i n i t i v a l s to a vp  the procedure determines the value of the c o n t r o l l e r   i . e . the antecedent of pro  and creates an anaphoric r e l a t i o n between pro and i t s c o n t r o l l e r . 
　　　　both the b i n d i n g and the c o n t r o l procedures e s t a b l i s h a r e l a t i o n between an antecedent and a bound anaphoric element. 	in the s y n t a c t i c s t r u c t u r e   t h i s r e l a t i o n s h i p is expressed by means of cos u b s c r i p t i n g   which is achieved as f o l l o w s 	: 	each c o n s t i t u e n t is attached a 	r e g i s t e r c o n t a i n i n g a 
p o i n t e r to i t s antecedent and a p o i n t e r to an anaphor. notice t h a t an anaphoric element can i t s e l f f u n c t i o n as the antecedent of an anaphor  thus det e r m i n i n g a chain of anaphoric r e l a t i o n s . at the end oi the s y n t a c t i c a n a l y s i s   a simple mechanism assigns an index to each anaphoric c h a i n . 
　　　　f i n a l l y   the ' t h e t a ' procedure v e r i f i e s t h a t the analyses s a t i s f y the c o n d i t i o n t h a t a l l the o b l i g a t o r y arguments of a verb be assigned a
