' universal algorithm does not represent a practical solution for 
	a given theory t  because 	of its gross inefficiency. 
this contribution is of theoretical relevance in that it exhibits a class of theories which possesses an r.e. set uult. this result can be applied in practice for the design of an actual algorithm: so far the design of a special purpose unification algorithm was more of an art than a science since for 
a given theory there was no indication whatsoever of how the algorithm might work. in fact the algorithms in table 1 of section 1 all operate on entirely different principles. 
the next 1 unification algorithms on the basis of the  abstract  universal unification algorithm it is possible to find a concrete algorithm much more easily by first isolating the crucial parts in the abstract algorithm and then designing a practical and efficient solution. the universal algorithm has been successfully applied to a special case  rs1   yielding a minimal algorithm  ss1a   which in addition is much simpler than the one previously known. a collection of canonical theories  hu1a  is a valuable source for this purpose and has already been used to find the first unification algorithm for abelian group theory and quasi group theory  la1    hu1 .
