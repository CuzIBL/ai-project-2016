introduction 
　　　development of the instrument described in t h i s paper was begun in 1 as a p a r t of the cont i n u i n g robot research program at the jet p r o p u l -
s i o n laboratory  ref. 1  . the program was concerned w i t h techniques f o r moving a v e h i c l e about at a remote l o c a t i o n and accomplishing useful tasks autonomously  w i t h o u t d e t a i l e d human i n t e r a c t i o n . the tasks of i n t e r e s t included l o c a t i o n and manipul a t i o n of rock samples on the surface of a p l a n e t . 
       the m o t i v a t i o n f o r development of the laser rangefinder  lrf  was to provide a means f o r g e o m e t r i c a l   three-dimensional l o c a t i o n o f objects or surfaces in the neighborhood of the robot v e h i c l e f o r use as i n p u t i n f o r m a t i o n to the autonomous c o n t r o l system. the lrf instrument was a p a r t of a   v i s i o n   system t h a t also included two t e l e v i s i o n cameras and a minicomputer. 
       the p o t e n t i a l usefulness of l a s e r ranging devices t o the f i e l d s o f a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e and applied robotics is only beginning to be r e a l i z e d . early programs tended to r e l y p r i m a r i l y on passive o p t i c a l devices such as s i n g l e or stereo 
t e l e v i s i o n cameras. 	more r e c e n t l y   	i n v e s t i g a t o r s 
such as n i t z a n   et a l .  ref. 1  have begun to explore the a p p l i c a t i o n s of lasers in p r o v i d i n g 
r e f l e c t a n c e as w e l l as range data. a system such as the lrf described herein is a u s e f u l adjunct to a robot system in t h a t 1  it provides an independent d e t e r m i n a t i o n pf o b j e c t l o c a t i o n   1  i t s e r r o r c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s and s e n s i t i v i t i e s are d i f f e r e n t from those of a t e l e v i s i o n system   i . e .   a lrf works in the d a r k     1  in many instances the desired i n f o r m a t i o n can be obtained f a s t e r   and a  the lrf beam may be d i r e c t e d such that it appears in a t e l e v i s i o n image and thus aid in such tasks as the matching of p i c t u r e elements in stereo p a i r s . 
       the most important problem i n i t i a l l y addressed was that of l o c a t i n g a r o c k - l i k e o b j e c t for graspi n g by a manipulator. a second problem  which is j u s t beginning t o receive a t t e n t i o n   i s t h a t o f 
       obstacle d e t e c t i o n or t e r r a i n mapping for use during v e h i c l e motion. these a p p l i c a t i o n s shaped the performance requirements f o r the lrf i n s t r u m e n t . 
       the instrument beam was to be d i r e c t e d at s p e c i f i e d p o i n t s or scanned over a s p e c i f i e d area under computer c o n t r o l . the manipulator hand was roughly the s i z e of a human hand  so a c a p a b i l i t y to determine the p o s i t i o n of a t a r g e t w i t h i n a few centimeters was d e s i r e d . this accuracy was needed over a r e g i o n extending roughly from 1 meter to 1 meters range. in a d d i t i o n   ranging w i t h good r e p e a t a b i l i t y to 1 to 1 meters  but w i t h o u t the centimeter accuracy requirement  was needed f o r v e h i c l e motion i n p u t s . a c a p a b i l i t y f o r outdoor o p e r a t i o n i n f u l l s u n l i g h t was also r e q u i r e d . reasonably f a s t o p e r a t i o n such that the o v e r a l l f u n c t i o n of the robot would not be slowed w h i l e 
w a i t i n g f o r data was also important  but no hard requirement f o r exceeding a c r i t i c a l minimum data r a t e was envisioned. f i n a l l y   since the u l t i m a t e a p p l i c a t i o n was to a planetary r o v e r   a technique 
which could u l t i m a t e l y r e s u l t in a reasonably s m a l l and rugged package was needed. 
       many r a n g e f i n d i n g instruments have been d e v e l oped  both w i t h b e t t e r accuracy and w i t h longer maximum range c a p a b i l i t y than we needed. 	however  no e x i s t i n g instrument would do the e n t i r e j o b . 
       for our a p p l i c a t i o n   a s o l i d - s t a t e i n j e c t i o n laser r a t h e r than other types of l a s e r s or an led 
source was d e s i r a b l e in order to ensure  both a s m a l l package and a f u t u r e c a p a b i l i t y of o p e r a t i n g 
at distances exceeding 1 meters. with such a l a s e r   pulsed o p e r a t i o n was necessary. averaging of the t r a n s m i t - t i m e measurement over many l i g h t 
pulses was i n c o r p o r a t e d in order to reduce the i n e v i t a b l e noise in the data to a reasonable l e v e l . averaging of the pulse t r a v e l time is an analogous to the heavy o u t p u t f i l t e r i n g t y p i c a l on cw phasetype lrf i n s t r u m e n t s . 
       in summary  these were the t e c h n i c a l cons t r a i n t s and requirements f o r the instrument described in the f o l l o w i n g s e c t i o n s .

inductive loop and is used as the timing reference for measurement of the light pulse transit time. the photomultiplier output pulse is of variableamplitude  depending on the nature of the target surface and i t s range. as a result  a module called a constant fraction discriminator  ref. 1  is introduced to minimize the effect of the amplitude of the reflected lignt pulse on the range 
measurement. 
　　the time interval measurement i t s e l f is made by a time-to-pulse-height converter  ref. 1   a module which produces a relatively long  1 microsecond  output pulse for each start-stop pulse pair accepted. the amplitude of this output pulse is accurately proportional to the start-stop time i n t e r v a l   and is subsequently sampled  averaged over many pulses  and converted to a d i g i t a l form for transmission to the computer which interfaces in real time with the lrf instrument. both c r i t i c a l elements in the time interval measure-
ment  the constant-fraction discriminator and the time-to-pulse-height converter  are commercial 
nuclear physics instrumentation. 
　　　the computer  a general automation spc 1  also supplies pointing commands which are used to drive the beam scanner. the scanner is a gimballed mirror driven by stepper motors in elevation and azimuth. the single mirror reflects both transmitted and received light beams  but there are separate  nonoverlapping transmitter and receiver apertures. 
　　　although the time-to-pulse-height conversion is sufficiently linear for our purposes without modification  slow delay time d r i f t s in the electronics would seriously l i m i t the accuracy of the lrf. in order to eliminate the effects of these drifts and permit object location to roughly onecentimeter  a self-calibration procedure has been 
incorporated. this procedure is equivalent to operating the instrument in a comparison mode in which an unknown position is determined relative to a known target. however  errors due to reflect i v i t y variations remain. in principle  the 
self-calibration procedure could be expanded to involve r e f l e c t i v i t y   but only at the cost of increased complexity. 
　　　a second operational requirement  called  reset   is needed to match the actual mirror step position with its corresponding d i g i t a l representation in the computer. mirror positioning is by an open-loop incremental process  and no stepby-step feedback is present to measure mirror position. the reset operation must be done at turn-on time  but no subsequent reset is required until the system is shut down  the mirror being 
moved one step at a time while the mirror position register is simultaneously incremented. potentiom-
eters are used to monitor mirror position during operation  and if a discrepancy between actual mirror position and the position register occurs  an error   skip-step   is signalled. the reset operation must be repeated after such an error. 
　　　the dominant error source for the range measurement is caused by the unknown reflectivity of the target  which results in a varying amplitude of the reflected light pulse. angle of incidence also contributes to the intensity variations. 
　　　measurement to an unknown target within 1 cm or better is possible with care. unexpectedly small reflected light intensity  as from a very 

black target  causes larger errors. adjustment of the constant-fraction discriminator is c r i t i c a l and must be maintained  although it has been found to be stable over periods of many days. perturbation of the shape of the photomultiplier pulse by cross-talk or ringing in the photodetector output circuit must be avoided in order to maintain stable discriminator performance. 
　　　the aforementioned errors caused by reflect i v i t y variation  also called  walk   are not 
fundamental in nature and are repeatable. they can be reduced by shortening the light pulse rise time  and can also be reduced if a better type of 
in tensity-independent discriminator could be 
	developed. 	candidates for testing exist  ref. 1    
	but to date we have not investigated them. 	walk

consonant w i t h broad mission goals. the major components are locomotion  m a n i p u l a t i o n   and v i s i o n systems. 
       lrf data is used by the path planning software in the generation of o b s t a c l e maps b e f o r e the v e h i c l e moves and  d u r i n g m o t i o n   in p r o v i d i n g a

       the v i s i o n system includes the lrf  two tv cameras  and associated s o f t w a r e . the cameras and lrf are mounted on a common p a n - t i l t head  approximately 1 meters above the surface of the v e h i c l e . the b a s i c task of the v i s i o n system is to detect and l o c a t e o b j e c t s of i n t e r e s t and also obstacles to v e h i c l e and manipulator motion. the dual tv cameras and t h e lrf combine to provide much redundant i n f o r m a t i o n . various ways of u t i l i z i n g the redundancy in an advantageous way are c u r r e n t l y being i n v e s t i g a t e d . 
coordinate frames 
       there are t h r e e coordinate frames relevant to l a s e r o p e r a t i o n   f i g . 1   . the f i r s t is the arm 
system  centered at the base of the manipulator on the v e h i c l e ' s s u r f a c e . the u n i t vectors of the arm system p o i n t   r e s p e c t i v e l y   across the v e h i c l e f r o n t  xa    in the d i r e c t i o n of forward v e h i c l e 
motion  y     and up from the v e h i c l e surface  za   . 

       the second coordinate frame is the r o t a t e d p a n - t i l t  rpt  system. i t s three axes  xr  yr  zr    
are a l i g n e d w i t h 	the p a n - t i l t head's r o t a t e d p o s i t i o n and p o i n t   	r e s p e c t i v e l y   	along the l i n e of 
s i g h t   	t i l t a x i s   	and pan a x i s . 	this frame is 
centered at 	the l a s e r   at the p o i n t where the beam 
would i n t e r s e c t the lrf m i r r o r when the instrument is at the   r e s e t p o s i t i o n   . the reset p o s i t i o n is the lrf a z i m u t h / e l e v a t i o n s e t t i n g t h a t d i r e c t s the beam along the l i n e o f s i g h t o f the p a n - t i l t head  the s o - c a l l e d   s t r a i g h t ahead  p o s i t i o n .

azimuth  α  and elevation   c     respectively. i t s third coordinate is a range number  r  equivalent to the time of f l i g h t to target. 
system-related effects impacting lrf performance 
　　　there are three major components to any evaluation of the lrf as it performs in the total robot system. these are vehicle-relative pointing accuracy  ranging accuracy  and external environmentrelative factors. 
　　　it has been found that the laser beam can be pointed with excellent repeatability. this is due in part to the fact that the beam cannot  rest  anywhere in i t s two-dimensional  azimuth  elevation  space  but only at the l a t t i c e points dictated by the incremental nature of the stepper 
motors. the pan-tilt head on which the laser is mounted is likewise an incremental subsystem. thus i t is that the beam can be repeatedly directed in the same physical direction whenever the four point-
ing variables  pan angle   t i l t angle θ  a  e  are repeated by command. this  of course  is one of the features enabling the recalibration process to function smoothly; the beam can reliably be directed to the same vehicle-fixed target points. 
　　　the accuracy of the beam direction relative to the vehicle is somewhat degraded. 	the position of the pan-tilt head  i t s alignment with the vehicle frame  and the orientation of the lrf azimuth and 
elevation axes relative to the pan-tilt assembly are only estimated. in particular  the  zero  
pointing direction  pointing the beam in the direction of vehicle motion  parallel to the frame  is accurate only to an estimated half degree. 
　　　another source of beam pointing error is vehicle sag. 	the platform on which the arm  pant i l t  including cameras and laser    and electronics rack are mounted is a somewhat flexible frame. tne platform sags slightly to varying degrees and in 
varying directions at different locations  thus 
affecting beam pointing. 
　　　ranging inaccuracies have been described in an earlier section. suffice it to say here that the net effect of errors in ranging is an inaccuracy in position estimates along the line of sight. 
　　　these error sources a l l affect the determination of position of an object in the environment. for precise position determination  a l l of the parameters of the transformations relating environment to instrument must be known. slight errors in estimating displacements between the arm and pant i l t and also along the pan-tilt to the laser  as 
well as errors in ranging and pointing  due largely to vehicle sag  a l l affect the accuracy to which 
an object in the external environment can be sensed. as the applications presented below show  however  even with a l l these sources of error  significant use of the instrument can be and has been made. 
software description  organization  
and user interfaces 
　　　the primary function of the laser software is to move the laser to a specified point and then take a range reading. moving the laser beam involves 
controlling the laser scan apparatus  picking a 
m	1can
＜de   several points and take readings  or 
slew to one point and take a range reading there   possibly moving the pan-tilt head  and allowing for the target point to be specified in a number of coordinate systems. beyond this  the software must combine these functions for the self-calibration procedure. in addition  the software allows for easy access to frequently used combinations of these basic functions. a number of control functions allowing direct communication between the 
user and the electronics are provided  and status and error indication flags are always returned. 
     the elementary control functions include an azimuth slew  move instrument to specified azimuth  take and return a range reading   an elevation slew  an azimuth scan  move instrument from present position to new azimuth  taking readings at each point 
along the way  and  if requested  use dma input   an elevation scan  an azimuth reset  and an elevation reset. the resets not only move the instru-
ment to its zero position  but in addition clear the device after  skip-step  errors so that accurate beam pointing readings  a e  can be assured. other control functions permit the electronics to be reset  cleared and initialized  and various tests  scan busy  power on  data ready  to be 
performed. 
     several composite functions are made easily available to the user. the simplest of these is the beam reset function  which resets both azimuth and elevation. a second function slews the laser to the specified laser step  a e  and takes n range readings. the average range number r is returned. if n   1  then the variance of the readings is also returned. 
     the third set of functions reads the pan-tilt head or moves it to a specified   θ  . 	each time the pan-tilt head is moved  the appropriate transformation is recalculated and saved for future use. 
     the fourth function provided is the selfcalibration procedure. here  the pan-tilt head is 
moved to a prespecified location  and 1 range 
readings are taken at each of two calibration points. the p a n - t i l t assembly is then restored to i t s precalibration position and the laser is reset  ready for use. 
     an i n i t i a l i z i n g command to the lrf software sets an automatic self-calibration time interval. thermal d r i f t necessitates periodic recalibration. the automatic   i . e .   time-dependent  recalibrating can be suppressed in order that recalibration only be done when specifically requested. 
     the f i f t h function performed by the lrf software is coordinate transformation. a vector in any of the frames lst  rpt  or arm can be re-expressed in any other of these three frames. 
     the sixth function is the scanning of a l i n e . the line endpoints can be expressed in any of the three coordinate frames  and the repointing of the pan-tilt assembly to the center of the line can be requested as an option as well. the lst     e   and associated arm  x  y  z  are returned for each scanned point. the scanning procedure generates a sequence of l a t t i c e points  recall that  a e  are restricted to the integers  as stepper motors are used to drive the laser  which most closely follows the desired l i n e . 
     the f i n a l function made available as an integral part of the software package is the  stop  

r o s o t f c s - 1 : 	lewis 
1 

function  which terminates the program after 
closing the mirror completely. the mirror is closed to avoid dust and scratches when the apparatus is not in use. 
　　　the software performing these functions  as a l l the laser software  is coded in fortran and assembly language on the general automation spc 1. 	the basic software package described above runs in less than 1k of core. 	this software is made available as a subroutine  lrf  to other users  and also has been combined with two supplemental functions and a teletype driver for standalone use. 
　　　the supplemental functions are a rectangle scan and a vehicle obstacle scan. the rectangle scan works like the line scan  accepting four corners expressed in any of the three coordinate-
frames. up to 1 parallel lines spanning the rectangle are scanned  and the highest  maximum z in arm coordinates  point is saved. it is assumed that the highest point is part of a rock  and the 
area about that point is  re- scanned to determine 
the rock's orientation. 	the rock's position and 
orientation are then output to a f i l e . this rectangle scan has been combined with the 
manipulator software to yield an end-to-end demonstration of integrated laser-manipulator operation. 
　　　the second supplemental function provided with the teletype driver is an obstacle scan at 1 meters in front of the vehicle. here the beam is swept side to side in an effort to locate severe adjacent-point range differences. if one is located  a single b i t is returned to the vehicle drive software. 
　　　a l l calls to the laser software result in an error/status flag being returned to the caller  or 
teletype . this flag reports violations of laser azimuth or elevation l i m i t s   laser drive step-
skipping  which would result in the beam position  a e  being unknown   range numbers  r  out of the domain of possibility  for example  because the power supply is off or because no reflected light pulse is returned   pan-tilt errors  and warnings that conversions to lst coordinates are out of the 
acceptable domain of operation. 
applications 
　　　the lrf software has been made operational and available to the robot research program as a package only relatively recently. nevertheless  the lrf instrument and software have already been 
applied to several tasks  with more currently being investigated. 	in this section  these applications are described. 
rockfinding 
　　　the rectangle scan described above as the f i r s t supplemental function has been combined with the manipulator software to yield automatic scanning  recognition  position and orientation determination  and retrieval of the tallest rock in a 1 cm x 1 cm scanned region. the elevation of the scanned points is displayed as intensity data on a video monitor  as shown in fig. 1. higher points appear darker on the displayed image. the range data is converted to arm coordinates  the z coordinate of which is converted to an integer corresponding to an intensity datum on the monitor.

 higher points displayed as darker  
　　　errors in the end-to-end sequence include a l l laser and pan-tilt pointing errors  laser ranging 
errors  vehicle sag and other transformation errors  and arm positioning and calibration errors. in essentially a l l cases  the laser instrument and algorithm precision are sufficient for the rock to 
be recognized and located by a laser beam aimed at i t   but only in about half the cases to date are the position and orientation data  transformations  and arm positioning and calibration accurate enough to result in the target rock being successfully retrieved and deposited in a sample box. continuing 
work on the use of arm-mounted proximity sensors as grasping aids  ref. 1  is expected to result in a 
much higher success rate. 
vehicle obstacle scan 
　　　the side-to-side laser scan described above as the second supplemental function is to be used as an in-motion early warning obstacle detector for vehicle motion. the beam is swept along a line 1 meters in front of the vehicle at ground l e v e l   from the outside of one wheel to the outside of the other  back and forth. no coordinate transforming of the raw data is performed  but rather  sharp differ-
ences in the raw range data themselves are sought. figure 1 graphically illustrates the returned range data when no obstacle is present and when a threeinch high box is present. the criterion for an obstacle currently being used is a range difference of 1 cm or greater between successive points. if this criterion is met  a flag is returned to the vehicle drive program  which can then stop the

vehicle  gather more data about the obstacle and surrounding environment  and plan a new path. 
　　　the present vehicle is heavy relative to the power available to drive i t   so that even an 1 cm object is an obstacle. range differences do not correspond directly to differences in elevation  and it is conceivable that an obstacle with smooth edges and no real corners could remain undetected. the described scan algorithm and obslacle criterion thus represent a compromise between simplicity  and 
speed  of operation  on the one hand  and effectiveness on the other. 
　　　another factor that tends to diminish the thoroughness of the scan is the effect of vehicle 
motion. 	a scan takes about 1 seconds  1 points at 1 points/second  . 	by moving the vehicle slowly in areas of more danger or less  complete knowledge of the environment  and by comparing detected

　　　the f i r s t user application to which the laser system has been put is obstacle mapping. 	before the vehicle is moved  a terrain map of the area 
must be obtained. a single television image could be used for this purpose  but then the information obtained is only two-dimensional; its location along the line of sight would remain unknown. television images from two cameras or from the same camera at two locations could provide three-
dimensional data  but only at the expense of correlating the video data from the. two images. accord-
ingly  the lrf  which provides three-dimensional data from a single  image   has been used to map the terrain in the vicinity of the vehicle. fig-

white  and unknown regions in the shadow of obstacles in black. 	the lower obstacle map in fig. 1

terrain maps covering the area between vehicle and target is made  after which the terrain can be 
searched for a safe path. 
range pictures 
　　　the lrf is quite sensitive to changes in range. a demonstration of its sensitivity and a b i l i t y to yield data of sufficient quality for scene  analysis work is presented in figs. 1 and 1. these figures are  rangepics . range data  integers from 1 to 1  have been converted to intensity data  1 to 1  and displayed on a video monitor. the pictured features are approximately 1 to 1 meters in front of the vehicle. the laser data were taken over a complete l a t t i c e of 1 x 1 lrf azimuths and elevations. as displayed  no correction for angular distortion has been made. the box-like 
structures in the images result from the fact that each laser datum is displayed as a 1 x 1 array of monitor pixels in order to f i l l the screen.

summary 
       a scanning l a s e r r a n g e f i n d e r f o r a r o b o t i c v e h i c l e has been described. i t s ranging accuracy approaches 1 cm w i t h optimum adjustment. the dominant e r r o r source is the e f f e c t of unknown r e f l e c t i v i t y and angle of incidence of the t a r g e t 
s u r f a c e . p o i n t i n g accuracy o f the instrument i t s e l f 
is w e l l w i t h i n 1 deg  a small e r r o r compared to the range e r r o r . however  the cumulative e f f e c t s 
or e r r o r s induced by xtounting the lrf on a p a n - t i l t assembly  p u t t i n g the e n t i r e apparatus on a v e h i c l e   and then r e l a t i n g the r e s u l t s to the environment 
also 	tend to degrade the performance of the lrf. 
       we f e e l t h a t the instrument could be improved s i g n i f i c a n t l y w i t h f u r t h e r development e f f o r t . f i r s t   c u r r e n t semiconductor techniques appear capable of reducing the r i s e t i m e of the l i g h t pulse 
s i g n i f i c a n t l y   and since the accuracy at present is d i r e c t l y dependent on r i s e t i m e   t h i s would be a p r a c t i c a l b e n e f i t . improvement may r e s u l t even though the peak pulse power may decrease  if pulse r e p e t i t i o n r a t e and r i s e t i m e can both be improved. 
       a second approach  independent of the l i g h t pulse shape  i n v o l v e s improvement of the t i m i n g d e c i s i o n through more e f f e c t i v e fast pulse e l e c t r o n i c s . such improvement could be obtained by performing a measurement of the r e f l e c t e d pulse h e i g h t and using the i n f o r m a t i o n to c o r r e c t measured range. a conventional i n t e n s i t y image as seen

       at present  the lrf i1 not d r i v e n by any requirement f o r a high data r a t e   and indeed  i t s data r a t e is very low. e f f o r t s to increase the data r a t e w i l l encounter a l i m i t a t i o n due to basic noise in the detected s i g n a l at about 1 data p o i n t s per second  w i t h the present l a s e r power. higher data rate w i l l i n v o l v e a t r a d e o f f in which u n c e r t a i n t y of a s i n g l e p o i n t increases p r o p o r t i o n a t e l y to the square r o o t of data r a t e . 
       even as the system stands today  numerous p r a c t i c a l a p p l i c a t i o n s have already been made and more continue to be i n v e s t i g a t e d . the r e s u l t s of these i n v e s t i g a t i o n s w i l l be reported as the cont i n u i n g i n t e g r a t i o n of the lrf and i t s software
