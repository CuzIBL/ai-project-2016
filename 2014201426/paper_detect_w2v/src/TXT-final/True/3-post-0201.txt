
an ontology consists of a set of concepts  a set of constraints imposing on instances of concepts  and the subsumption relation. it is assumed that an ontology is a tree under the subsumption relation between concepts. to preserve structural properties of ontologies  the ontology revision is not only contracting ontologies by discarding statements inconsistent with a revising statement  but also extracting statements consistent with the revising statement and adding some other statements. in the ontology revision  the consistency of a revising statement with the theory of the logical closure of the ontology under the closed world assumption is discussed. the basic postulates of the ontology revision are proposed and a concrete ontology revision is given based on the consistence or inconsistence of an ontology and a revising statement.
1 introduction
a general approach for studying belief revision is to provide a set of postulates such as the agm axiom  alchourr et al.  1  and the dp axiom  darwiche and pearl  1  for belief revision functions.
모in the process of building and maintaining ontologies  new statements which may be inconsistent with ontologies are added to the ontologies constantly  and it is necessary for the ontologies to be revised to accommodate new statements. for convenience  we assume an ontology o is a tree under the subsumption relation between concepts and can infer what are not explicitly stated by the ontology.
the ontology revision should have the following features:
모  similar to belief revision  there are two kinds of ontology revision: ontology-set revision and ontology-base revision. for an ontology o  its ontology-set is th o   a set of statements deduced from o by a set of inference rules; and its ontology-base is o. in this paper  we only discuss ontologybase revision. moreover  like belief revision  the ontology

 
모모the work is supported by the national nsf of china  1  1 and 1   the national 1 project of china  g1  and ministry of science and technology  1cca1 .revision satisfies some basic principles: success  consistency and minimal change.
모  in belief revision  if a knowledge base k and a revising statement 붸 is inconsistent then k is to be contracted. in ontology revision  let o   붿 be the ontology results from revising o by a revising statement 붿; s be the smallest set of statements extracted from o to ensure  o 뫋 {붿}    s is consistent;   be the smallest set of statements extracted from o other than s  and t be the smallest set of statements added to o   붿 other than 붿  which is consistent with  o 뫋 {붿}    s.
to preserve structural properties of the revised ontology  let
o   붿 =   o 뫋 {붿}     s 뫋     뫋 t.
모  an ontology o is inconsistent iff there is a statement 붻 such that 붻  붻 뫍 ocwa  where ocwa is an extended theory of th o  in terms of the closed world assumption. an ontology revision should consider two cases:  1  o 뫋 {붿} is consistent; and  1  o 뫋 {붿} is inconsistent. when o 뫋 {붿} is inconsistent  if 붿 is positive then either  붿 뫍 o  붿 뫍 th o  or  붿 뫍 ocwa; otherwise  either  붿 뫍 o or  붿 뫍 th o .
모in terms of the postulates the ontology revision should satisfy  to preserve structural properties of ontologies and infer implicit statements ontologies have inherently during revision processes  we propose a z axiom system for the ontology revision and a concrete operator satisfying the z axiom system.
1 ontologies
definition 1 an ontology o consists of
모 1  a set of concepts and properties;
모 1  four binary relations: the subsumption relation v between concepts; the inheritance relation   and the default one  d between concepts and properties; the implication relation 1뫸 between properties; and
모 1  a set of positive statements of the form
c v d|c    |c  d  |    c|  1뫸 뷍
and their negations of the form
c 1v d|c 1   |c 1 d  |   1 c|  1뫸 뷍 
where c d are concepts and   뷍 are properties.
모c v d means that c is a sub-concept of d; c     means that   is a property of c instantiated by every instance of c; c  d   means that   is a default property of c  which means that normally  every instance of c satisfies  ;   1뫸 뷍 means that   implies 뷍 logically;     c means that any instance satisfying   is an instance of c. we assume that if a statement 붻 is positive  then  붻 is its negation; otherwise   붻 is its positive form.
모an ontology o is assumed to be complete about the properties in the following sense:  1  every property is in o;  1  for any properties   뷍 뫍 o  if   logically implies 뷍 then   1뫸 뷍 뫍 o; and  1  for any concepts c d 뫍 o  if c 1= d then there is a property   such that either c  d   and d 1 d    or c 1 d   and d  d  .
모deduction rules in ontologies include transitivity rules   default  inheritance rules and the closed world assumptions.
for the inheritance rules 
 and  
there is a priority order among the default rules so that subconcepts override super-concepts. for the transitivity  besides the transitivity of v among concepts  there are the following three kinds of transitivity rules:
.
with the above rules  we define o ` 붻 if there is a deduction of 붻 from o. then  th o  = {붻 : o ` 붻} and ocwa =
th o  뫋 { 붻 : o 1` 붻 붻 is positive}.
1 the ontology revision
for an ontology o to be revised and a revising statement 붿  we have the following presuppositions about  :
모1. o is consistent and o   붿 is an ontology.
모1. 붿 is of the form: c v d c 1v d c     and c 1   .
모1. the ontology revision satisfies the principles of success 붿 뫍 o   붿   consistency  o   붿 is consistent  and minimal change  the symmetric difference between the set of statements in o and the set of statements in o   붿 is minimal. 
모1. statements other than 붿 are added to o   붿 to infer implicit statements.
모to keep the structure of o   붿  we may add to o   붿 new statements if 붿 = c 1v d; and extract statements from o if 붿 = c v d. not like in the belief revision  in the ontology revision  revising statement 붿 is atomic.
모based on the above discussion  we propose a z axiom system for the ontology revision:
z1. o   붿 is an ontology.
z1. o   붿 is consistent if 붿 is not contradictory.
z1. 붿 뫍 o   붿.
z1. if o 뫋{붿} is consistent  then o  붿 =  o 뫋{붿}   . z1. if o 뫋 {붿} is inconsistent  then
o   붿 =   o 뫋 {붿}     s 뫋     뫋 t.
z1. if o   붿 ` 붻 then  o   붻    붿 뫖 o   붿.
z1. if o   붿 `  붻 then  o   붻    붿 뫖 o   붿.
모the z axiom system is the combination of the agm axiom and the dp axiom for the iterated belief revision. for the ontology revision  such a combination is appropriate  because of 붻 being atomic.
theorem 1 the z axiom system satisfies the principles of success  consistency and minimal change.
모theorem 1 holds for the ontology revision  because we use atomic statements to revise ontologies  and in the belief revision  the revising statements may not be atomic.
1 a concrete ontology revision  
we shall give a concrete ontology revision   satisfying the z axiom system. assume that 붿 is not contradictory  otherwise  let o   붿 =   . by presupposition 1  붿 is of one of the following forms: c v d; c 1v d; c    ; c 1   .
모in the ontology revision  o 뫋 {붿} is either consistent or inconsistent. when o 뫋 {붿} is consistent  if 붿 is positive then either 붿 뫍 o 붿 뫍 th o  or  붿 뫍 ocwa; otherwise  붿 /뫍 th o . when o 뫋 {붿} is inconsistent  if 붿 is positive then either  붿 뫍 o  붿 뫍 th o  or  붿 뫍 ocwa; otherwise either  붿 뫍 o  or  붿 뫍 th o .
모the concrete ontology revision   is given according to the above 1 cases. for the page limit  we only discuss two cases:
case 1.	o 뫋 {붿} is consistent and 붿 = c v d 붿 /뫍
o th o   붿 뫍 ocwa. let o   붿 =  o 뫋 {붿}       where   = {c   e 뫍 o : d   e /뫍 th o }.
case 1. o 뫋 {붿} is inconsistent and 붿 = c v d  붿 뫍 o. let o   붿 =   o 뫋 {붿}     s 뫋     뫋 t; where
s = {c 1v d} 뫋 {c 1    뫍 o : d     뫍 th o }뫋
모모{c 1 d   뫍 o : d  d   뫍 th o };   = {c   e 뫍 o : d   e /뫍 th o };
t = {c     뫍 th o  : d     /뫍 th o }뫋 {c  d   뫍 th o  : d  d   /뫍 th o }.
모by verifying that   defined in every case satisfies the z axiom  we have the following theorem:
theorem 1 the defined   satisfies the z axiom system.
1 further works
the future work will introduce to the ontology revision the logical properties between statements  such as c     implies c  d    etc.   the structure of concepts  complex concepts as  c c ud  etc.  and properties in description logics and first order logic  which are omitted for the simplicity in this paper.
