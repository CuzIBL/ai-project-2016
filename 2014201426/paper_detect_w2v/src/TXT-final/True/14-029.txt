i introduction 
　　　texture carries useful information with which a vision system may discriminate objects and identify them. thus it is necessary to describe textures compactly  for example  for scene analysis  analysis of aerial photographs  or diagnosis of medical images. texture has been studied on at least two levels: statistical and structural   on the statistical level  a texture is defined by a set of statistics extracted from a large ensemble of local picture properties. on the structural level  a texture is considered to be defined by elements which occur repeatedly according to placement rules. roughly speaking  statistical methods are suitable for micro-textures and structural methods are suitable for macro-textures. there are at least four types of textures from the view of analysis. the model texture patterns are shown in fig.1. pattern a has many small texture elements in the image. so it can be described by global statistics without regard to the texture elements. pattern b also has many small texture elements but they form local clusters. it is reasonable to regard clustered texture elements as regions and to describe the structure of those regions. pattern c has comparatively large texture elements; it is reasonable to describe the structure of the fexture 
elements. pattern d also has large texture elements but they c o n s t i t u t e subpatterns. it is reasonable to group such l o c a l l y ordered texture elements and describe the structure of the subpatterns. in t h i s paper  a system is proposed which analyzes textures s t a t i s t i c a l l y or s t r u c t u r a l l y depending on t h e i r natures. hierarchical descriptions of textures can be produced by the system. 

ii overview 	of 	analysis 
     an overview of the flow of processing is shown in fig.1. 
 1  measurement of global statistics 
     the system f i r s t describes every input texture globally to roughly classify i t . it measures global gray level f i r s t order statistics and global edge statistics. they are adequate to describe textures like pattern a in f i g . l . 
 1  region extraction based on gray levels 
     the system extracts homogeneous gray level regions to try to describe a texture structurally. however  if too many regions are extracted or if regions cannot be easily extracted  this indicates the existence of micro-textures like patterns a and b in f i g . l . 
 1  region extraction based on local statistics 
　　　if the system recognizes the existence of micro-textures  it examines if the micro-textures constitute regions like pattern b in f i g . l . the system extracts such regions based on local gray level f i r s t 'order statistics and local edge statistics. if there is no different region like pattern a in f i g . l   it stops analyzing a texture structurally. 
 a  selection of figure and ground 
	if there is more than 	one 	class 	of 	regions 
 which have been classified based on gray levels or local statistics   the system distinguishes ground regions from figure regions to examine only the structure of figure regions. 
 1  region decomposition based on shape 
1 

     if the shapes of the figure regions are complex  the system decomposes them into regions of simpler shapes. the decomposed regions are atomic texture elements. 
 1  structural description of texture elements 
     the system f i r s t classifies the atomic texture elements based on the shape  and next based on .the placement  and lastly computes the distributions of shape and placement of each class of texture elements. 
 1  grouping of texture elements 
     if there are locally ordered texture elements like pattern d in f i g . l   they are grouped into subpatterns. the system produces a structural description of the subpatterns in the same way as it did for the atomic texture elements. 

	i l l 	measurement of global statistics 
     a number of statistical methods have been suggested for texture description . gray level f i r s t order statistics and edge statistics are used in this research. edge statistics produce not only the same kinds of features as gray level co-occurrence matrices   which are most popularly used second order statistics and evaluated better than some other statistics  1   but also produce more structural features. 
a. gray level first order statistics 
     the system normalizes an input image with respect to gray scale changes so that the mean is 1 and the standard deviation is 1 and then computes skewness  the third order moment  and entropy for a gray level histogram. skewness is a measure of the symmetry of a histogram and entropy becomes low when dense clusters appear in a histogram. 
b. edge 	statistics 
     an edge element has the descriptors of the edge value and the edge direction. the system uses edge elements whose edge values are locally maximal and greater than a threshold. it first classifies edge elements by recursively thresholding the descriptor histograms  and computes the next statistics for each class of edge elements. 
 1  density of edge elements 
     the density of edge elements is the number of edge elements per unit area and is a measure of texture coarseness . the higher the edge density  the finer the texture. if the edge density is very high  the system can estimate the existence of micro-textures in an image without directly counting the number of texture elements in step 1 in fig.1. 
 1  first order statistics of edge values 
     the mean of edge values is a measure of contrast and the entropy of edge values is a measure of gray level randomness. 
 1  first order statistics of edge direction 
     the directionality of a texture can be detected from an edge direction histogram . the system computes a histogram of edge direction measured modulo π so that the distributions between π and 1Π are the same as those between 1 and π. it f i r s t computes the entropy of the histogram to 
measure the edge direction randomness. next  if there are 1n  n 1  clusters in the histogram  the system recognizes the existence of n directions and computes the mean and the standard deviation of each cluster between 1 and π. if there is only one cluster in the histogram  however  it represents no directionality in the texture. 
 a  second order statistics of edge direction 
     more structural features can be extracted from the second order statistics of edge directions  1 . the co-occurrence probability of two edge elements with the same edge direction separated by a distance k along the edge direction  edge elements e1 and e1 in fig.1  represents a linearity  k-linearity  of a texture. the co-occurrence probability of two edge elements with the same edge direction separated by a distance k along the direction perpendicular to the edge direction  edge elements e1 and e1 in fig.1  represents the periodicity of a texture. the co-occurrence probability of two edge elements with the opposite edge direction separated by a distance k along the direction perpendicular to the edge direction  edge elements e1 and e1 in fig.1  represents the size of texture elements. the system  however  measures only the k-linearlty  k-1  since it measures periodicity and the size of texture elements more precisely in the later structural analysis of step 

1 in f i g . 1 . 

iv region extraction baaed on gray laval 
　　　the system extracts homogeneous gray level regions to try to describe a texture structurally. there are two basic methods for region extraction: the thresholding method and the merging method. in the thresholding method  the gray level histogram of an image is computed. if there are some clusters in the histogram  the image is segmented into regions so that the gray levels in a region belong to one of the clusters. the thresholding method  however  is too global; even though there are visually distinctive regions in an image  it is usual that no distinctive!cluster appears in the gray level histogram because of the blurry effects. in the merging method  on the other hand  adjacent points in an image are merged into regions based on the gray level similarity. the merging method  however  is too local to evaluate the limit of the gray level similarity. 
　　　this paper proposes a merging-andthresholding method which combines the two methods to offsets the defects of each; the merging method is repeated until distinctive clusters appear in the gray level histogram and then the thresholding method is applied. the procedure of extracting regions from an input image 1  is as follows. 
 1  set k-1. 
 1  generate an image i k  by merging adjacent points whose gray level differences are less than k into regions and averaging the gray levels in the regions. 
 1  compute the gray level histogram h k  of the image i   k   . 
 a  test whether distinctive clusters exist in the histogram h k . if so  go to step 1   or else set k-k+1 and go to step 1 . 
 1  threshold 1  by the gray levels 	between 	the clusters 	in the. histogram h k  in order to extract regions. 
　　　for example  the gray l e v e l histogram h l  of an image in fig.1 a  is shown in f i g . 1   b   . no separable c l u s t e r e x i s t s in it. merging by k=1 makes two separable c l u s t e r s appear in the histogram h s  as shown in f i g . 1   c   . as a r e s u l t   the image are segmented i n t o regions by thresholding as shown in f i g . 1   d   . 
v region extraction baaed on local s t a t i s t i c s 
	if too many regions are extracted 	or 	regions 
are extracted by too large a k value  the system recognizes the existence of micro-textures in an image* in such a case  it extracts regions based on the l o c a l gray l e v e l f i r s t order s t a t i s t i c s and the l o c a l edge s t a t i s t i c s * f i r s t   it computes the 
mean gray l e v e l and the density of each class of edge elements  which have been c l a s s i f i e d in section i i i . b   in the neighborhood of every point* next  it extract regions based on the l o c a l s t a t i s t i c s computed   1     for example  edge elements of an image in fig*1 a  are shown in f i g . 1   b   . in t h i s case  the edge elements are c l a s s i f i e d i n t o two classes by thresholding the edge d i r e c t i o n histogram as shown in f i g . 1   c   . then the system computes the l o c a l density at every point for each class of edge elements and it extracts regions of high edge density as shown in f i g . 1   d   . l a s t l y   i t extarcts regions i n fig.1 e  by superimposing regions extracted separately in fig.1 d  and by merging small overlapping regions to neighboring large regions. if the system cannot extract such d i f f e r e n t regions  however  it stops analyzing a texture s t r u c t u r a l l y . 

vi selection 	of 	figure and 	ground 
	if there is more than 	one 	class 	of 	regions 
 which have been c l a s s i f i e d based on gray levels or l o c a l s t a t i s t i c s     one of them can be regarded as the ground of an image. if an observer has knowledge about the objects in the image  he can recognize the regions corresponding to the objects as a f i g u r e . on the other hand  if he knows nothing about the o b j e c t s   he cannot determine which regions correspond to the f i g u r e of the image. psychologically  however  regular regions are apt to be the f i g u r e of the image. in the learning phase of our system  a user can a r b i t r a r i l y select a ground region class* otherwise  the system ranks region classes 





represents that no subpattern e x i s t s . for example  texture elements in fig.1 b  and fig.1 are grouped i n t o one group respectively. 
	x 	conclusion 
　　　a system is proposed here which analyzes texture s t a t i s t i c a l l y or s t r u c t u r a l l y depending on the nature of textures. the system f i r s t describes a texture globally by gray l e v e l f i r s t order s t a t i s t i c s and edge s t a t i s t i c s to roughly c l a s s i f y i t . next  it produces a h i e r a r c h i c a l s t r u c t u r a l description if possible. the texture is described at the top l e v e l by subpatterns arranged according to placement r u l e s . each subpattern is also described by subpatterns at a lower l e v e l in the same way  and so on. at the bottom l e v e l   each subpattern is described by atomic texture elements. atomic texture elements are l o c a l l y homogeneous regions of simple shape. the shape descriptors of an atomic texture element or a subpattern are the s i z e   the area  the d i r e c t i o n of the major axis and the r a t i o of the minor axis to the major a x i s . the placement rules measured are r e l a t i v e position vectors between texture elements or subpatterns.
