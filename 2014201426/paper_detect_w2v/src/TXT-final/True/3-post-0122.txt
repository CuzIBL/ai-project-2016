1 introduction
preferences are becoming of greater interest in many areas of artificial intelligence  such as knowledge representation  multiagent systems  constraint satisfaction  decision making  and decision-theoretic planning. in the logic of preference there is a debate when a set of preferences should be consistent. for example  bacchus and grove  criticize ceteris paribus preferences  because {p    p  p ¡Ä q   p ¡Ä q} should be consistent  and they criticize most existing logics of preference  because {p    p q    q   p¡Äq    p¡Äq} should be consistent. in order not to restrict the use of the logic of preference  we propose a minimal logic of preference in which any set of specified preferences is consistent. to make it useful for practical applications  we extend this logic to specify preferences with a logic to query preferences  and with a nonmonotonic reasoning mechanism.
1 new semantics for the logic of preference
we introduce a logic of preference that distinguishes between specifying and querying  inspired by preference-based deontic logic  van der torre and tan  1 . we define two types of preference statements  where p !q can be read as  it is specified that p is preferred to q  and p  q can be read as  the result of the query states that p is preferred to q. 
definition 1  language  given a set a = {a1 ... an} of propositional atoms  we define the set l1 of propositional formulas and the set l of preference formulas as follows. l1 p q: ai |  p |  p ¡Ä q 
l 1 ¦Õ ¦×:  p !q  |  p  q  |  ¦Õ |  ¦Õ ¡Ä ¦× 
moreover  disjunction ¡Å  material implication ¡ú and equivalence   are defined as usual. we abbreviate formulas of the preference logic using the following order on logical connectives:   | ¡Å ¡Ä |  !    |¡ú  . for example   p !q ¡Ä r is short for   p ! q ¡Ä r  .
¡¡typically many conflicts arise during the specification of preferences. our logic of preference represents any set of preferences in a consistent way  which is achieved in two steps. first  we do not use a total pre-order on worlds in the semantics  but a partial pre-order on worlds  i.e.  a reflexive and transitive relation. incomparable worlds indicate some kind of conflict among these worlds. secondly  and more originally  we formalize a preference p !q as the absence of a q world that is preferred over a p world.
definition 1  specifying  let w be the set of propositional interpretations of l1  and o a partial pre-order on w. we write w   w1 for w o w1 without w1 o w  and |¦Á| for {w ¡Ê w | w |= ¦Á}.
  o|= p !q iff  w ¡Ê |p| and  w1 ¡Ê |q| we do not have w1   w.
semantic entailment for more complex formulas  logical entailment and other logical notions are defined as usual. for example  ¦Õ1 ... ¦Õn |= ¦Õ if and only if for all o such that o|= ¦Õi for i = 1...n  we have o|= ¦Õ.
¡¡we define a logic for querying preferences by optimization in a specified preference relation. we use the same semantic structures  but to simplify the definitions we assume that there are no infinitely ascending chains  see  e.g.   boutilier  1  for a discussion . moreover  p is preferred to q if the optimal p ¡Å q worlds are p worlds.
definition 1  querying  we assume o does not contain any infinite ascending chains. we write max o p  for {w ¡Ê w | w |= p and  w1 ¡Ê w : w1   w   w1 |1= p}.
  o|= p  q iff max o p ¡Å q    max o p .
we distinguish models called most connected models.
definition 1  distinguished models  a model o1 is at least as connected as another model o1  written as o1vo1  if o1 o1  that is  if  w1 w1 ¡Ê w : w1 o1 w1   w1 o1 w1. a model o1 is most connected if there is not another model o1 such that o1 o1  that is  such that o1vo1 without o1vo1.
¡¡non-monotonic reasoning is based on distinguished models in the usual way. these distinguished models have sometimes been called preferred models  and non-monotonic entailment has been called preferential entailment. however  to avoid confusion with the preferences formalized in our logical language  we do not use this terminology in this paper.
definition 1  non-monotonic entailment  a preference specification is a set of specification preferences ps = {p1 !q1 ... pn !qn}. a distinguished model of a preference specification ps is a most connected model of ps. a preference specification non-monotonically entails ¦Õ  written as ps |=v ¦Õ  if for all distinguished models o of ps we have o|= ¦Õ.
1 logical properties
specifying and querying preferences are complementary in the sense that the logic of the former satisfies left and right strengthening  and the logic of the latter satisfies transitivity.
1 ordering
we first show that our desideratum holds. a preference specification which only contains preferences which are individually consistent  is itself consistent.
proposition 1 if there is a model for each preference in ps  then there is a model of ps.
proof. the identity relation {w o w | w ¡Ê w} is such a model of ps.
¡¡the logical relations among preference specifications are characterized by left and right additivity. la |=  p ¡Å q !r     p !r  ¡Ä  q !r 
ra |=  p !q ¡Å r     p !q  ¡Ä  p !r 
¡¡consequently  reading the additivity formulas from left to right  specification preferences are strong preferences  in the sense that they satisfy the following properties of left and right strengthening.
ls |=  p !q  ¡ú  p ¡Ä r !q 
rs |=  p !q  ¡ú  p !q ¡Ä r .
¡¡moreover  reading the additivity formulas from right to left  specification preferences satisfy left and right disjunction.
lor |=  p !r  ¡Ä  q !r  ¡ú  p ¡Å q !r 
ror |=  p !q  ¡Ä  p !r  ¡ú  p !q ¡Å r 
¡¡in case of a finite set of atoms  the combination of ls  rs  lor and ror give a simple way to derive all implied preferences from a preference specification. call a formula a complete sentence when it implies p or  p for each proposition p ¡Ê a. given a preference specification ps  first use ls and rs to derive preferences among complete sentences. secondly  use lor and ror to derive all preferences among formulas.
¡¡finally we consider some borderline cases. as usual  we cannot have that a proposition is preferred to itself. this is due to the fact that o is reflexive.
id |=   p !p 
¡¡moreover  an important distinction among preference logics is whether they satisfy transitivity. our logic to specify preferences does not  because we may have r worlds preferred to p worlds  and q worlds incomparable to both p and r worlds.
t 1|=  p !q  ¡Ä  q !r  ¡ú  p !r 
1 optimizing
optimizing preferences have been studied in the context of total pre-orders. for example  weydert  defines elementary qualitative magnitude logic as follows  in a propositional preference logic extended with actual worlds: qm1  p   q  ¡Ä  q   r  ¡ú  p   r   transitivity 
qm1  p   q  ¡Ä  p   r     p   q ¡Å r   additivity 
qm1   q   p  ¡Ä  q   r  ¡ú  p   r   maximality 
qm1 ¡Í   ¡Í ¡Ä   ¡Í   p     p   p    quasi-reflexivity 
qm1 ¡Í   p ¡ú  p  correctness 
qm1  p   q     r   s  if `  p   r  ¡Ä  q   s   extensionality 
of these formulas qm1 cannot be expressed in our logic  and the relevant properties to check are qm1  qm1 and qm1. it can be verified that qm1 and qm1 also hold for our logic based on partial pre-orders  but qm1 does not.
¡¡in some cases  it may be useful to define a stronger notion of specification preferences  as a combination of  ! and   .
definition 1 p 1q = p !q ¡Ä p  q
¡¡consequently  if we have o|= p 1q then we also have o|= p  q  a property that does not hold for  !. that is  if we have o|= p !q  then we do not necessarily have o|= p  q.
1 modal characterization
it is well known that the combination of two logics in a single logical system may be problematic  and that the axiomatization of such a combined logic is a non-trivial task. to obtain an axiomatization of our logic  we follow  boutilier  1  by providing a modal characterization of the logic. we define  or simulate  the preference logic in a normal bimodal system  where 1 is a universal modal operator and 1 is a normal modal operator. see  e.g.   boutilier  1  for an axiomatization of the bimodal logic.
definition 1 let l1 be a modal logic with two modal operators 1 and 1. moreover  let a model of l1 be a tuple m = hw o v i  with w a set of worlds  o a partial preorder on w  and v a valuation function of propositions at the worlds. the satisfiability relation for modal formulas is defined as follows.
  m w |= 1p when  w1 ¡Ê w we have m w1 |= p.
  m w |= 1p when  w1 ¡Ê w : w1 o w   m w1 |= p.
moreover  we add the following definitions to l1:
  1p =  1 p  1p =  1 p
  p !q = 1 p ¡ú 1 q 
  p  q = 1 q ¡ú 1 p ¡Ä  q ¡Ä 1 p ¡Å q ¡ú p ¡Ä  q
