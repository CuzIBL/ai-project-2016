 
a prototype dialog system is presented which specializes in responding to the questions of a user who is assumed to be attempting to form an evaluation of a given object. on the basis of explicit assumptions concerning the evaluator's standards and prior expectations  the system goes beyond the direct answering of the questions by selecting additional comments according to their anticipated impact on the evaluator's impressions of the object. the system may be positively or negatively biased in i t s selection of comments; taking into account the  possibly different  bias which it assumes the evaluator to ascribe to i t   it anticipates how the fact that it has failed to make certain comments is likely to be interpreted. the system's central concepts are also used to quantify the notion of the relatedness of a given comment to a given topic and to guide the selection of connectives and sentential adverbs. 
a small boy in texas had the habit of asking strangers where they were from.  you shouldn't ask them that   said his father.   i f a man's from texas  h e ' l l t e l l you so himself. if he's from anywhere else  h e ' l l be ashamed if you ask.  
the research reported here was conducted in part at the research unit for information science and a r t i f i c i a l intelligence at the university of 
hamburg  which is supported by the german ministry for research and technology. the author is indebted to the members of that group  as well as to adam mehrdad  for helpful discussions. 
   this anecdote illustrates three points which should be taken into account in the design of any dialog system which supplies the user with information which may be relevant to the evaluation of a particular person or object: 
1. human speakers frequently volunteer unsolicited comments which have consequences for the evaluation of an object under discussion. 
1. the selection of such comments is influenced by the nature of the speaker's bias  e.g. a desire to present the object in a favorable light. 
1. listeners take these facts into account when interpreting such comments  or their absence  so much so  in fact  that it is wise for the speaker to anticipate such interpretations. 
　　the present paper describes imp  a dialog system designed specifically as a restricted prototype which permits the exploration of these topics without the overhead associated with an nl system of broad capabilities. the system engages in what may be called evaluation-oriented dialog: it takes the role of an informant responding to the questions of an evaluator whose sole dialog goal is assumed to be the assessment of some object  e-gwith a view to making a decision concerning it  cf. the example dialog in figure 1 . 
　　dialogs of this general sort occur in many everyday situations - e.g. personnel selection interviews and discussions with salespeople. the evaluation-oriented dialogs which imp can handle are quite restricted in terms of the number of speech act types and dialog goals involved  as can be seen from the description of its top-level control procedure in figure 1.* this simplification makes it unnecessary for the system to reason explicitly about dialog goals and ways of realizing them  cf.  e.g. cohen  1   although the system does consider carefully what impact its utterances w i l l have upon the listener.

the representation of values and expectations 
　　imp is supplied in advance of each d i a l o g w i t h an evaluation form  figures 1 and 1     which can be viewed as a p a r t i c u l a r l y e x p l i c i t v a r i a n t of a type of scale which one frequently sees used in p r a c t i c a l contexts which require systematic evaluations   e . g . the r e f e r e e i n g of conference papers . the system behaves as if it believed t h a t the evaluator possessed t h i s same form and was asking questions in order to f i l l it in so as to be able to estimate a numerical r a t i n g for the object along the dimensions corresponding to the various scales. it is assumed t h a t the evaluator w i l l not in general ask questions about a l l of the items in the form  but w i l l use the frequency information in it to make estimates concerning the scales not covered. 
　　the basic idea underlying t h i s metaphorical conception of the e v a l u a t o r ' s judgme n t a l processes is t h a t the s u b j e c t i v e evaluation of an object is an a d d i t i v e f u n c t i o n of the perce ived value and l i k e l i h o o d o f i t s possession of various a t t r i b u t e s . * * this idea f i t s i n t o a long t r a d i t i o n in normative and d e s c r i p t i v e research on a t t i t u d e and judgment  see  e . g .   fishbein & aizen  1 . it could be made more r e a l i s t i c i f r e s u l t s concerning  e . g .   the way people d eal w i t h small p r o b a b i l i t i e s were taken i n t o account but i t i s d o u b t f u l t h a t such changes would n o t i ceably improve the appropriateness of imp's response s or increase i t s v a l i d i t y as a model of a naive in formant. 
* winograd's  1  language dl is used here  somewhat e l l i p t i c a l l y   to describe the e s s e n t i a l workings of the system. procedures whose i n t e r n a l s t r u c t u r e is not r e l e v a n t to the issues of i n t e r e s t here are not described; most of these are r e a l i z e d in imp using ad hoc methods which make heavy use of s p e c i f i c hand-coded database e n t r i e s . 
   invocations of such procedures are underlined in the f i g u r e s and marked w i t h an & in the r i g h t margin; a l l other underlined concepts are introduced in the same f i g u r e or in the f i g u r e

selecting comments - overall strategy 
　　figure 1 shows how in imp the task of generating appropriate u n s o l i c i t e d comments is conceived as a search through the evaluation form for items which 
warrant 	some comment other than the pseudo-comment '   s i l e n c e * 1 . this search could undoubtedly be 	made more 	e f f i c i e n t 	and 	p l a u s i b l e 	if 	a d d i t i o n a l h e u r i s t i c s 	were 	introduced 	to 	make 	it 	mor.e 
s e l e c t i v e   	e . g . 	by 	making e a r l y reference to the items' 	o v e r a l l importance  which is at present used only for the d e t a i l e d r a t i n g of i n d i v i d u a l comments   c f . conklin & mcdonald  	1 . 
　figure 1 describes the processing performed 	for each item in the form t h a t the system i n s p e c t s . 	imp has no i n t e r e s t i n g 	methods 	for 	c o n s t r u c t i n g 	new comments 	on 	a given item; of i n t e r e s t is only the way in which it selects the 	most 	appropriate 	one from 	a 	set 	of 	candidates which is assumed to be r e p r e s e n t a t i v e of the i n f i n i t e set of comments t h a t 


could conceivably be made. its overall strategy is f i r s t to select the comment which  if interpreted l i t e r a l l y   would have the most desirable effect on the evaluator's impressions  and then to take into account the way this comment would in fact be interpreted. the system anticipates this pragmatic interpretation both in order to keep track of the evaluator's changing beliefs concerning the object and to help f i l t e r out comments which would betray its bias  as shown in figure 1 . 
a. jameson 1 
   the relative weight assigned to these two factors by a given informant can in principle vary greatly as a function of various features of the dialog situation. at present  they are given equal weight  so that they both have noticeable effects on the system's behavior. their sum is regarded as the 'benefit' which would result from making the comment in question. 

rating possible comments 
impression changes 
   the kernel of imp is the criteria which it uses to assign a numerical rating to a possible comment  assuming that the comment w i l l be interpreted l i t e r a l l y . the central factor which it takes into account is the comment's anticipated impact on the evaluator's corresponding impression of the object.  figures 1 and 1 . the motivation underlying the concepts of expected value and uncertainty introduced here can best be seen if one considers how changes in these quantities are related to the dialog goals of an informant. 
   on the one hand  any informant is likely to be interested in shifting the favorability of the evaluator's impression in some direction - either generally upward or generally downward   i f the informant is biased  or in the direction of the truth   i f the goal is to present an accurate profile of the object . in any case  the chance in expected value should enter into the formula for rating a comment  figure 1 . 
   on the othe r hand  eve n a comment which merely confirms that an expected value is in fact accurate may be consid ered worth making if cons iderable uncertainty p reviously e xisted with r espec t to the item. a reduct ion in unce rtainty puts the e valuator in a better po sition to m ake decisions ant icipates questions that might othe rwise have to be a sked and answered sepa rately  and is generally f e l t to be a part of polite cooperati ve dialog ben avior 

effort 
　　if the system is not to break into tedious monolog after each question  it must have some notion of the effort involved in making and understanding a comment. the simplest solution would be for it to subtract from the rating of every comment except ' silence*' some number such as 1  the exact one chosen depending on the degree of volubility desired . but this would not do iustice to the fact that some utterances are more detailed  complex  roundabout  or unnatural than others  cf. grice's  1 maxims of quantity and manner  and must thus be considered to be associated with more effort. imp makes no contribution to the d i f f i c u l t problem of defining and quantifying such a notion  see  e.g.  mccawley  1 ; it simply uses stored ratings which associate different degrees of effort with the various possible comments. 
question-relatedness 
　　even when volunteering comments which have not been specifically requested  the system should give preference to comments which are directly or indirectly related to the topic of the evaluator's latest question  cf. grice's maxim of relation . there are a variety of reasons why speakers tend to 


1 	a. jameson 
	rate a comment 	 c  	assuming 	a 	particular 
realized possibility and a bias 
purpose: produce an integer reflecting the net benefit for the informant of making c assuming 
 a literal interpretation working structures: 
av: the actual value  i.e. the y alii♀ of the possibility assumed realized 
ur:theuncertainty reduction  i.e. the arithmetic difference between the respective uncertainties of c's impression before and impression after 
dls: the desirability of the impression shift  an integer describing the relationship between the expected yaliifi of c's impression before  ev1  and impression after  ev1 : if the bias is: 1
  positive   then ev1 - ev1  upward shifts are desirable  
 'negative'  then ev1 - ev1  downward shifts are desirable  
	  'objective'  then iev1 -avi 	- 	ev1 - av i 
　　 reductions in inaccuracy are desirable  effort: the effort associated with c. 
　rel-imp: the relative importance of c's topic  i.e. the ratio of its importance to that of the entire evaluation form. qr: the question-relatedness of c's topic basic method! 
return the following value: 

do this. for example  when a question has been asked about a given topic which  according to the evaluation form  is relatively unimportant  this fact suggests that the present evaluator may attach 
more importance to this topic than was originally expected. although this need not be the case  it may be worthwhile to devote increased attention to such topics in order to take the possibility into account. 
　　imp's criteria for choosing comments are designed in such a way that the system's ratings w i l l satisfy several constraints which appear generally reasonable in view of considerations such as these. 

connectives and sentential adverbs 
　　whenever a sequence of evaluation-relevant statements is made  it is usual to preface each one  except perhaps the f i r s t     with words which announce to the listener in advance what sort of impression change is about to occur. the rules that imp uses for the selection of expressions like but  by the way  and unfortunately make reference to a comparison of the shift in expected value produced by the present comment with that produced by the preceding statement  taking into account the question-relatedness of their respective topics. some conceptual apparatus such as the one introduced above for independent reasons is required if the use of such expressions in evaluation-oriented statements is to be explicated with a satisfactory degree of precision  cf. weydt  
concluding remark 
   when imp's actual an d projected biases diverge  as in the examples giv en here  i t s behavior smacks of deception  and it ma y be asked what practical consequences the deve lopment of systems of this sort might have. but as dialog systems continue to be accorded more i n i t iative in their interactions with users  questions concerning their dialog motivation w i l l have be investigated explicitly and publicly  whether the a im is to formulate realistic norms or simply to prevent discrepancies from arising between the sys terns' actual motivation and their users' image of i t.
