
in machine learning  ml  and evolutionary computation  ec   it is often beneficial to approximate a complicated function by a simpler one  such as a linear or quadratic function  for computational efficiency or feasibility reasons  cf.  jin  1  . a complicated function  the target function in ml or the fitness function in ec  may require an exponential amount of computation to learn/evaluate  and thus approximations by simpler functions are needed. we consider the problem of approximating pseudo-boolean functions by simpler  e.g.  linear  functions when the instance space is associated with a probability distribution. we consider {1}n as a sample space with a  possibly nonuniform  probability measure on it  thus making pseudo-boolean functions into random variables. this is also in the spirit of the pac learning framework of valiant  valiant  1  where the instance space has a probability distribution on it. the best approximation to a target function f is then defined as the function g  from all possible approximating functions of the simpler form  that minimizes the expected distance to f. in an example  we use methods from linear algebra to find  in this more general setting  the best approximation to a given pseudo-boolean function by a linear function.
1 introduction
a pseudo-boolean function of n variables is a function from {1}n to the real numbers. such functions are used in 1 optimization problems  cooperative game theory  multicriteria decision making  and as fitness functions. it is not hard to see that such a function f x1 ... xn  has a unique expression as a multilinear polynomial
  
where n = {1 ... n} and the at are real numbers. by the degree of a pseudo-boolean function  we mean the degree of its multilinear polynomial representation.
¡¡several authors have considered the problem of finding the best pseudo-boolean function of degree ¡Ü k approximating a given pseudo-boolean function f  where  best  means a least squares criterion. hammer and holzman  hammer and holzman  1  derived a system of equations for finding such a best degree ¡Ü k approximation  and gave explicit solutions when k = 1 and k = 1. they proved that such an approximation is characterized as the unique function of degree ¡Ü k that agrees with f in all average m-th order derivatives for m = 1 ... k  in analogy with the taylor polynomials from calculus. grabisch  marichal  and roubens  grabisch et al.  1  solve the system of equations derived by hammer and holzman  and give explicit formulas for the coefficients of the best degree ¡Ü k function. zhang and rowe  zhang and rowe  1  use linear algebra to find the best approximation that lies in a linear subspace of the space of pseudo-boolean functions; for example  these methods can be used to find the best approximation of degree ¡Ü k.
¡¡here  instead of simply viewing the domain of a pseudoboolean function as the set {1}n  we consider {1}n as a discrete sample space and introduce a probability measure on this space. thus  a pseudo-boolean function will be a random variable on this sample space.  viewing {1} simply as a set corresponds to viewing all of its points as equally likely outcomes.  given a pseudo-boolean random variable f  we then use methods from linear algebra to find the best approximation to f that lies in a linear subspace  taking into account the weighting of the elements of {1}n. such a best approximation will then be close to f at the  most likely  n-tuples  and may not be so close to f at the  least likely  n-tuples.
1 best approximation on a non-uniform domain
we will identify the integers 1 ... 1n   1 with the elements in bn via binary representation. let p i  i =
1 ... 1n   1  be a probability measure on bn. let f denote the space of all pseudo-boolean functions in n variables. then f has the structure of a real vector space. define an inner product h   ip on f by
           1n 1 f gip = x f i g i p i .
i=1
we note that hf gip is the expected value of the random variable.
¡¡now let l be a vector subspace of f of dimension m. for example  l might be the space of all pseudo-boolean functions of degree at most k  for some fixed k. we recall how to use an orthonormal basis of l to find the best approximation to a given element of f  cf.  hoffman and kunze  1  .
¡¡let v1 ... vm be a basis for l. we can find an orthonormal basis u1 ... um for l by applying the gram-schmidt algorithm. this orthonormal basis satisfies the property hur usip = ¦Ärs for r s = 1 ... m  where ¦Ärs equals 1 if r =1 s and equals 1 if r = s. the orthonormalbasis can be obtained as follows: take u1 = 1/ k v1 kp v1. if u1 ... ur 1 have been obtained  then   and take ur =  1/ k wr kp wr.
¡¡given f ¡Ê f  the  best approximation  to f by functions in l is that function g ¡Ê l that minimizes
             1n 1  f   g kp = uutx f i    g i  1p i .
i=1
notice that if we take the uniform distribution on bn  so that p i  =  1 n for all i  then the best approximation to f in l is the function g ¡Ê l that also minimizes
n
. this is the usual  least squares  condition used in  hammer and holzman  1    grabisch et al.  1    zhang and rowe  1   and in this case one may simply use the usual euclidean inner product in r1n. in our more general setting  it follows from section 1 of  hoffman and kunze  1  that the best approximation to f by functions in l is the unique function g = pmj=1hf ujipuj.

1 example
to illustrate these ideas  we look at an example considered by  zhang and rowe  1 . take n = 1 and f x1 x1 x1  = 1+1+1x1  1x1  1x1x1x1. we wish to approximate f by the best linear function  so we let l be the space spanned by the functions v1 = 1 v1 = x1 v1 = x1 v1 = x1. if we take the uniform distribution on b1  so that p i  = 1 for i = 1 ... 1  then by applying the gram-schmidt algorithm we get the following orthonormal basis for l with respect to the inner product h   ip: u1 = 1 u1 =1   1 u1 = 1   1 u1 = 1   1.
 more generally one can show that  for any n  an orthonormal basis for the space of pseudo-boolean functions of degree at most 1 with respect to the uniform distribution is 1x1  
 then the best linear approximation to f is
g  1 1¡¤  = pj1hf u1  jipuj =	1  	1  
	1	1
	=	1+	 1x	1 +  1x	1 +1x	1 
1	1	1
=   +	x1 + x1 +1  1	1
in agreement with example 1 of  zhang and rowe  1 .
here  k f   g kp ¡Ö 1.	1
¡¡now we take a different probability measure on b . supposing that a  1  is twice as likely as a  1  we define a probability measure p on b1 by p  1  = 1 p  1  = 1 p  1  = 1 p  1  = 1 p  1  = 1 p  1  = 1 p  1  = 1 p  1  = 1. an orthonormal basis for l with respect to the inner product h   ip  is then
.
then the best linear approximation to f is now g  x1 x1 x1  = pj1hf ¡Ìu jip u j = ¡Ì ¡Ì
	1 1 1 1
	=	¡¤ 1+	u 1+	u 1+	u 1
	1	1
=  1   1x1x1x1 .
here  k f   g  kp  ¡Ö 1. for comparison  the distance now between the linear function g we found above and the function f is k f   g kp  ¡Ö 1.
1 conclusion
instead of considering bn = {1}n simply as a set  we allow it to be viewed as a sample space wth a probability measure p. then pseudo-boolean functions are random variables on this sample space. given a complicated pseudo-boolean function  it is natural to want to approximate it by a simpler function  for example a linear or quadratic function. as an example  we found the best linear approximation to a given pseudo-boolean function in three variables with respect to two different probability measures on b1. further research is needed to find an effective method of computing the best approximation on a non-uniformdomain when the number of variables is large.
