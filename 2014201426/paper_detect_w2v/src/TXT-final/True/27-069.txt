 
behef revision and belief update have been proposed as two types of behef change serving differ ent purposes belief revision is intended to capture changes of an agent's belief state reflecting new information about a static world belief update is intended to capture changes of behef in response to a changing world we argue that both belief revision and behef update are too restrictive  routine behef change involves elements of both we present a model for generalized update that allows updates in response to external changes to inform the agent about its pnor beliefs this model of update combines aspects of revision and update  providing a more realistic characterization of behef change we show that  under certain assumptions  the original update postulates are satisfied we also demonstrate that plain revision and plain update are special cases of our model  in a way that formally verifies the intuition that revision is suitable for  static  belief change 
1 	introduction 
an underlying premise in much work addressing the design of intelligent agents or programs is that such agents should hold beliefs about the true state of the world typically these behefs are incomplete  for there is much an agent will not know about its environment. in realistic settings one must also expect an agent's behefs to be incorrect from time to time if an agent is in a position to make observations and detect such errors  a mechanism is required whereby the agent can change its behefs to incorporate new information 
　theories of belief change have received considerable attention in recent years in the ai community one crucial distinction that has come to light in this work is that between belief revision and belief update the distinction can be best understood as one pertaining to the source of incorrect beliefs on the one hand  an agent's behefs about the world may simply be mistaken or incomplete  for instance  in the case where it adopts some default behef if an agent observes that this behef is mistaken  it must take steps to correct the misconception such a process is know as behef revision  of which the theory of alchourron  gardenfors and makinson  1  1  is the best-known characterization on the other hand  
1 	non-monotonic reasoning 
an agent s behefs  while correct at one time may have become inaccurate due to changes in the world as events occur and other agents act  certain facts become true and others false an agent observing such processes or their results must take steps to ensure its state of belief reflects these changes this process is known as behef update  as proposed by wlnslett 
 1  and kalsuno and mendelzon  1  
　in this paper  we describe a semantic model for belief change that generalizes behef update to incorporate aspects of behef revision the aim of this model is twofold  a  to provide a unifying semantics for both revision and update that highlights the orthogonal roles both have to play in routine belief change and  b  to provide a more compelling account of belief update to deal with observations of changes in the world that provide information about the prior world state 
　there have been attempts to provide general semantics for behef change operators  e g    friedman and halpern 1   
but often these models ore such thai under certain assumptions the change is a revision and under others it is an update we argue that routine behef change should involve both update and revision and develop a model that incorporates aspects of both but we show that revision and update as currently conceived  are special cases of our general operator 
　the result of this union is a more robust and realistic notion of update m which observations of change can inform and agent's pnor beliefs and expectations such observations are pervasive consider the following example a warehouse control agent believes it is snowing on route 1 after yesterday's weather forecast  and expects the amval of a number of trucks to be delayed now suppose a certain truck arrives  causing the agent to update its beliefs  furthermore  contrary to its 
expectations  the truck arrives on time there are two possi ble explanations either the truck was able to speed through the snow or it did not snow after all if the latter ex plana don is more plausible  current update theories cannot arrive at the desired update in a natural way the observation of the change in the world's state  amval of the truck  indicates that the agent's pnor beliefs  e g   that it is snowing  were wrong the update should not simply involve changes that reflect the evolution of the world  but should place these changes in the context of the corrected or revised pnor behefs the agent should revise its behefs to capture the fact that it is did not snow and adjust its expectations regarding the amval of other trucks accordingly routine belief changes often involve aspects of revision  correcting or augmenting one's behefs  and update  allowing beliefs about the world to  evolve   

　the general model we present to capture such considerations takes as a starting point the notion of ranked or structured belief sets by ranking situations according to their degree of plausibility  we obtain a natural way of assessing degrees of belief and a very natural semantics for belief revision such models have been used extensively for revision  grove 1  gardenfors 1  boutilier 1c  to this we add the notion of a transition or evolution from one world state to another as proposed by katsuno and meodelzon  km   updates re fleet changes in the world  and transitions can be used to model such changes however in contrast to the km model and following our earlier work  bountiher 1a   we assume that the relative plausibility of transitions  and hence possible updates  is not something that is judged directly rather we assume that events or actions provide the impetus for change the plausibility of a transition is a function of  a  the plausibility of possible causing events  and  b  the likelihood of that event having the specified outcome in this way  we can model events or actions that have defeasible effects  which can be judged as more or less likely  
　finally  in response to an observation  an agent attempts to explain the observation by postulating conditions under which that observation is expected an explanation consists of three components an initial condition  an event  or action   and an outcome of that event- the key aspect of our model is the ranking of such explanations - an explanation is more or less plausible depending on the plausibility of the initial condition  the plausibility of the event given that starting point  and the plausibility of the event's outcome the belief change that results provides the essence of the generalized update  gu  operator an agent believes the consequences of the most plausible explanations of the observation 
　unlike other theories of update  our model allows an agent to trade off the likelihood of possible events outcomes and prior beliefs in coming up with plausible explanations of an observauon of course  by allowing pnor beliefs to be changed  during update we are essentially folding belief re-
vision into the update process  as we elaborate below  we thus generalize the km update model to work on structured  rather than flat  belief sets furthermore  the information required to generate such explanations is very natural 
　in section 1 we present the agm theory of revision and the km theory of update  emphasizing the semantic models that have been proposed and adopting the qualitative probabilistic model of  1  1  in section 1 we present our model of generalized update  with an emphasis on semantics  and contrast it with the  flat  km model we describe two examples to illustrate the key features of the model in section 1 we describe the formal relationship between revision  update and gu we show that under certain assumptions gu satisfies the km postulates in addition we show that both  flat  km update and agm revision are special cases of gu in particular the connection formally verifies the intuition that agm revision is due to changes in belief about a static world  while update reflects belief change about an evolving world 
1 	classical belief revision and belief update 
throughout  we assume that an agent has a deductively closed belief set k  a set of sentences drawn from some logical language reflecting the agent's beliefs about the current state of the world for ease of presentation  we assume a logi-


katsuno and mendelzon  1  have proposed a general char actenzation of belief update that seems appropriate when an agent wishes to change its beliefs to reflect changes in  or evolution of  the world the km theory is also captured by a set of postulates and an equivalent semantic model we describe update in terms of a knowledge base kb rather than a deductively closed belief set k 
　if some new fact a is observed in response to some  unspecified  change in the world  i e. some action or event occurrence   then the formula kboa denotes the new belief set incorporating this change the km postulates governing admissible update operators are 


   as a concrete example  suppose that someone observes that the grass in from of her bouse is wel prior to the observation she believed that she left her book outside on the patio and that the grass and book were dry  seekbinfigure 1 b   as shown in the figure the most plausible evolution of the epistemically possible world w  given the wet grass  is v  hence she believes her book got wet too this may be due to the fact that the most likely cause of wet grass is rain  which dampens things on the patio as well a less plausible transition  world u  is caused by the sprinkler being activated however  had she observed dry b in addition to wer g  she would have accepted this explanation  and its consequences  such as her glasses being dry if they are with her book  
1 	generalized update 
one difficulty with the km theory of update is that it does not allow an observation to force revision of an agent's beliefs about the state of the world prior to the observation this is a crucial drawback  for even though one may not care about outdated beliefs directly  information gained about one's prior state ofbeliefcan influence updated beliefs even simple tasks such as modeling information gathering actions are beyond the scope of km update consider  for example  moore's  1  litmus test the contents of a beaker are unknown and one dips bonus paper into it to determine if it is an acid or a 


	boutilier 	1 

contained in the model m  we note that the agent's actual beliefs are determined by the minimal worlds in k＜  1 e   those v such that 
　as with km update  updates usually occur in response to some observation  with the assumption that something occurred to cause this observation after observing a an agent should adjust its beliefs by considering that only the most plausible transitions leading to a actually occurred. the set of possible a-transitions is 

the most plausible a transitions  denoted min  tr a    are those possible a-transitions with the minimal k ranking given that a has actually been observed  an agent should assume that one of these transitions describes the actual course of events the worlds judged to be epistemically possible are those that result from these most plausible transition 

def let k be the belief set determined by update model m the generalized uptime of k by a  w r t m  is 

in other words  an agent updating by observation a believes what is true at the states that result from the most plausible a-transitions we also have the following 
  or  equiv  
this conforms to our intuitions about the updanng process the direct update of a' by  determines the same belief set as the process of first updating one's entire epistemic slate k to get   and thed performing belief revision of by the observation a loosely  we might say 
　this notion of update naturally gives rise to the notion of an explanation for observation a we can view updating by a as a process of postulating the most likely explanations for a and adopting the consequences of these explanations as our new beliefs unlike update of unstructured belief sets  
explanations must consider  and trade-off  plausible initial conditions  events and event outcomes that lead to a an 
explanation for a  given model m  is any triple  w e i/  such that 	 which implies 
　　　thus it is possible that e occurred at w  leading to v and resulting in a the most plausible explanations for a are those explanations with minimal k-ranking if a is explainable  i e  if the set of explanations is not empty   then the most plausible explanations correspond to the most plausible a-transitions thus gu can be interpreted as an abductive process note  however that proposition 1 means we not generate explanations explicitly 
　before considering the formal properties of this model  we illustrate its nature with two examples to keep the treatment simple  in the first example we use only deterministic events  while in the second we assume only one possible evenl 
　figure 1 a  illustrates the prior belief state of an agent who believes her book is on the patio  p  and that both the grass and her book are dry however  if her book is not on the patio  she believes she has left it inside  we omit other less plausible worlds we assume three events it might rain  the sprinkler might be turned on  or nothing happens 
1 	n1n-mon1nic 	reasoning 
 the null event  she judges  = 1  kw rain  = 1 and  = 1  so ram is more plausible than 
sprinkler  we assume a  global  ordering  suitable for all w  the outcomes of these events are deterministic - in particular both nun and the sprinkler will make the grass wet  but the book will only get wet if it rains and it is on the patio now  if wet grass is observed  our agent will update her beliefs to accept wetg a consequence of this is that she will now believe her book is wet the most likely explanation is simply that it rained if wetg a dryb are both observed  for instance  if she is told the book is safe   there are two most plausible posterior worlds satisfying the observation  i e   k wetg a dryb  = 1  this corresponds to the existence of two plausible explanations either the book is on the patio  k = 1  and the sprinkler turned on  k = 1   or the book is inside  k = 1  and it rained  k = 1  the result is that the agent is no longer sure where the book is if we had instead set k sprinkler  = 1. observing wetg a dryb would have caused the agent to believe that the book bad been inside all along the sprinkler explanation for the dry book becomes less plausible than having left the book inside we see then that observing certain changes in the world can cause an agent to revise its beliefs about previous states of affairs these revisions can impact on subsequent predictions and behavior  e g   if the book is inside then so are her glasses  1 
　a second example is shown in figure 1 b  we assume only one possible event  or action   that of dipping litmus paper in a beaker the beaker is believed to contain either an acid or a base  k = 1   little plausibility  k = r  is accorded the possibility that it contains some other substance  say kryptonite  the expected outcome of the test is a color change of the litmus paper it changes from yellow to red if the substance is an acid  to blue if it is a base  and to green if it is kryptomte however  the litmus test can fail some small percentage of the time  in which case the paper also turns green this outcome is also accorded little plausibility  k = g  if the paper is dipped and red is observed  the agent will adopt the new belief acid unlike km update  generalized update permits observations to rule out possible transitions or previously epistermically possible worlds as such  it is an appropriate model for revision and expansion of beliefs due to information-gathering actions if an outcome of green presents two competing explanations either the test failed  the substance is an acid or a base  or the beaker contains kryptomte the most plausible explanation and the updated belief state depend on the relative magnitudes of g and t the figure suggests that g   r  so the a test failure is most plausible and the belief acid v base is retained. if test failures are more rare  r   g   then this outcome would cause the agent to believe the beaker held kryptonite 
1 	relationship to revision and update 
the analysis of the update postulates is similar to that presented in  boutilier 1a  there we described a model of update that used plausible events to explain the occurrence of observations  giving rise to an update operator only under 
   'the world in dryb wetg at k - 1 is shown for illustration. technically that world has rank 1 since it occurs below and the explanation  sprinkler and book inside  will never be adopted  unless further propositions and observauons can distinguish the two worlds 

certain assumptions docs this operator satisfy the km postulates  and we argued that these assumptions are not always appropriate the key difference here is that the abductive approach has been generalized to allow ranked outcomes of events  and more importantly  ranked belief structures surprisingly this has little bearing on the update postulates the same assumptions are required we describe these briefly and refer to  boutilier 1a  for further discussion we first note that our model satisfies a number of the km postulates 
prop 1 if is the gu operator induced by some gu model then o satisfies postulates  ul   u1   v1    u1 and u1  
　one key difference between the gu model and the km model is reflected in  u1  which asserts that kbo a is equiv-
alent to kb whenever kb entails a this cannot be the case in general  for even if kb  = a  the most plausible event occurrence may be something that changes another proposition while leaving a true observing a may simply mean that the change proceeded as expected  u1  is appropriate only if we are willing to assume persistence of propositions   hat changes  are believed to  occur only if evidence for them is observed. while appropriate in some settings  this is not a universal principle suitable for belief change nevertheless  we can model it by assuming centered update models 

in  boutilier 1a  we criticized  u1  as inappropriate for the update of flat belief sets for example  if our beliefs corresponded to a single world where acid is believed   u1  forces the observation of blue to behave quite poorly  as described above  however  such a maxim is much more reasonable in generalized update it does not force one to propose wildly implausible transitions from prior epistemically possible states  instead one can revise one's beliefs to account for the observation in this case  we simply give up the belief acid 
　there are a number of systematic ways in which one can enforce the condition of completeness such as requiring the existence of  miraculous  events that can cause anything  boutilier 1a  in our setting  one quite reasonable condition we might impose is that ail worlds have some plausibility  i e   k is a total function on w  and that the null event is possible  not necessarily plausible  at each of those the first requirement is usually assumed of epistemic states  and the second simply ensures that all worlds persist with some degree of plausibility thus while explanations of a may be implausible they will not be impossible 
finally putting propositions 1 and 1 together we have 
thm 1 if o is induced by a complete  centered gu model then o satisfies  u1  u1  
we note that the converse of this theorem and the preceding propositions is easy to verify  though not especially interesting primarily  we are interested in determining the nature of belief change given information about beliefs events and event ordenngs  rather than the construction of models that corroborate arbitrary operators satisfying the postulates we also note that our characterization theorem includes  u1  because of our use of k-rankings  which totally order events and worlds one of the main reasons for using such rankings is that they allow the scales of plausibility used to rank worlds  events and outcomes to be compared and added in general  the use of qualitative ranking relations does not admit this flexibility unless one is willing to postulate a  metric  by which a combination of preorders can be compared this is not a difficult task  but is somewhat more cumbersome than the approach provided here equivalent results should be obtainable m the more general setting however 
　there are two special cases of gu that are worth mentioning in passing first  we note that  plain  km update 
	boutilier 	1 
of unstructured belief sets is easily captured in our model by the simple restriction of k to rank worlds only as plausible  k = 1  or impossible  k = ±  second  reasoning about agent-controlled action  and observations  is also possible  as indicated in the litmus example to do so  we simply view an agent's actions as events we associate with each action a a / -ranking kw a that ranks outcomes of action a at world w we take the key difference between actions and events  at least  as far as belief change is concerned  to be that actions are within the agent's control so that it has direct knowledge of their occurrence as such  actions need not be ranked according to their plausibility of occurrence  nor do they need to be postulated as part of an explanation observations can only be explained by supposing the action had a particular  perhaps unexpected  outcome  or by revising beliefs about the initial conditions  or both1 
　we wrap up by considering how agm belief revision can be modeled in our framework. the common folklore states that belief revision is a form of belief change suitable when  he world is static or unchanging to verify this intuition  we propose static update models 

thm. 1 if 1 is induced by a static gu model then o satisfies  r1 - r1  
static event models have as the only possible transitions those of the form u' - w w with plausibility k w  thus  the informal intuition about belief revision  and the agm model  can be verified formally agm revision is a particular form of gu suitable for a  static  system.  the converse of theorem 1 is eastly verified  
1 	concluding remarks 
we have provided a model for generalized belief update that extends both the classical update and revision models combining the crucial aspects of both  and retaining both as special cases the main feature ofgu is its insistence one be allowed to both revise and update one's beliefs about the world in response to an observanon 
　in this paper  we have focussed exclusively on the semantics of generalized update appropriate representation languages for the concise expression of events  with defeasible effects   defeasible beliefs and other aspects of the model must soil be developed however  the many components of such languages are already in place  based primarily on conditional and dynamic logics  and other action languages 
　one issue that has remained unexplored to a large extent is that of revising beliefs about system dynamics  event and outcome plausibilities  the gu model supposes that events and outcomes are specified independently of an agent's beliefs and are static in general  however  one might expect an agent to have beliefs about these entities which are subject to revision while not inconsistent with our model  a more elaborate treatment requires a language in which  defeasible  beliefs about events  outcomes  and so on can be expressed 
　　concurrent events and actions require special attention how ever  and are beyond  he scope of this paper 
1 as above we assume k is a total function on w 
1 	non-monotonic reasoning 
　another crucial issue is that iterated updates that arise with sequences of events and observations  this introduces several complications one is bow to revise an epistemic state k  rather than a belief set a   in response to an observation  several proposals exist for iterated revision  spohn 1  boutilier 1b  williams 1  but their applicability to this problem remains to be verified a related problem is that the plausibibty of a sequence of transitions need not be a function of the individual transitions  as discussed in  friedman and halpern 1   more sophisticated update criteria are required  including judging the plausibibty of sequences of transitions as a whole if such a general semantic picture is titled with a language with which to reason about events  we should be able to recast tbe gu model as a form of belief revision about such  histories   thus  the general view of explanation as a form of belief revision  gardenfors 1  bouulier and becher 1  can be extended to the explanation of observations in dynamic systems
