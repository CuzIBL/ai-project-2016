       for the past f i v e years  sri i n t e r n a t i o n a l has p a r t i c i p a t e d in a major program of research on the a n a l y s i s of continuous speech by computer  sponsored by the advanced research projects agency of the department of defense. the goal of the program was the development of a speech understanding system capable of engaging a human operator in a n a t u r a l conversation about the performance of a p a r t i c u l a r task  see newell et al .  1 . a r a t h e r complex set of s p e c i f i c a t i o n s defined the parameters more p r e c i s e l y . the program culminated in the demonstration of a system t h a t did meet the t a r g e t s p e c i f i c a t i o n s  see reddy et a l .   1; medress et a l .   1   but more important for a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e were developments in the various knowledge sources- p a r t i c u l a r l y syntax  semantics  and discourse-and in the system a r c h i t e c t u r e necessary for 
c o o r d i n a t i n g them e f f i c i e n t l y and e f f e c t i v e l y . 
       at sri  we have made s i g n i f i c a n t advances both in b u i l d i n g components f o r knowledge sources and in developing a' framework for c o o r d i n a t i n g and c o n t r o l l i n g them. the s y n t a c t i c component is a performance grammar; it describes the syntax of the english used in spontaneous d i a l o g r a t h e r than the english of e d i t e d t e x t . the semantics component uses a p a r t i t i o n e d semantic network to enable the r e p r e s e n t a t i o n o f m u l t i p l e a l t e r n a t i v e parses without d u p l i c a t i o n   the a s s o c i a t i o n o f s y n t a c t i c u n i t s with t h e i r network images and the establishment of scopes f o r higher order predicates   e s p e c i a l l y q u a n t i f i e r s   . a discourse component has been developed t h a t uses the context of the preceding d i a l o g to r e s o l v e d e f i n i t e noun phrase references and expand e l l i p t i c a l u t t e r a n c e s ; i t works on the p a r t i a l knowledge a v a i l a b l e when parsing an u t t e r a n c e . 
this research has been funded under the f o l l o w i n g

acoustic components and those providing higher level language processing  we were able to collect data on the performance of the sdc components and have used this information in extensive tests of our components and of the system framework. it is on the basis of these experiments that we report on the sri developments in speech understanding in this paper 
	ii 	the 	operation 
　　　when a speaker records an utterance  it is analyzed acoustically and phonetically  and the results are stored in a f i l e . when these data are available  the executive begins to predict words and phrases on the basis of context-guided by the rules for phrase formation in the language definition-or to build up phrases from words that have been identified acoustically in the utterance. as each phrase is constructed  relevant semantic and discourse information is checked  and if appropriate  a semantic network representation of the phrase is developed. when the performance of a task results in the prediction of a word at a specified place in the utterance  alternative phonological forms of that word are mapped onto the acoustic data for that place  and a score 
indicating the degree of correspondence is returned. when an interpretation for the entire utterance is complete  relevant structures from the semantic model of the domain and from an associated relational data base are processed to identify in semantic network form the content of an appropriate response. this response is then generated either in text form or through the use of a speech 
synthesizer. 
i l l the language definition 
　　　the input language is a subset of natural  colloquial english that is suitable for carrying on a dialog between a user and the system regarding information in the data base. the definition of this language consists of a lexicon containing the vocabulary  a set of composition rules for combining words into phrases and smaller phrases into larger ones  and some global declarations giving information needed by the definition compiler  which translates the language definition into an efficient internal representation  and by the executive  which operates on that representation. the lexicon is separated into categories  such as noun and verb  and the words in each category are assigned values for various attributes  such as particular grammatical features and semantic representations. the composition rules are phrase-structure rules augmented by a procedure that is executed whenever the rule constructs a phrase. information provided by the procedure includes both attributes of the phrase based on the attributes of i t s constituents  and factors for use in judging the acceptability of the phrase. the global declarations give such information as l i s t s of attributes for the different categories. 
　　　an attribute statement may compute values that specify acoustic properties related to the input signal  syntactic properties such as mood and number  singular or plural   semantic properties meaning of the phrase  and discourse properties for anaphora and e l l i p s i s . the values of constituent attributes are used in computing the attributes of larger phrases  and the attributes of complete interpretations are used in generating responses. 
　　　the factor statements compute acceptability ratings for an instance of the phrase. the scores for factors are non-boolean; that i s   they may assume a wide range of values. as a result  a proposed instance of a phrase is not necessarily simply accepted or rejected; it may be rated as more or less acceptable depending on a combination of factor values. like attributes  factors may be acoustic  syntactic  semantic  or discourse related. acoustic factors reflect how well the words match the actual input; syntactic factors deal with tests like number agreement between various constituents; semantic factors assure that the meaning of the phrase is reasonable; and discourse factors indicate whether an e l l i p t i c a l or anaphoric phrase makes sense in the given dialog context. the values of factors are included in a composite score for the phrase. the scores of constituents are combined with the factor scores to produce the scores of larger phrases  and the scores of complete interpretations are used in setting executive p r i o r i t i e s . 
　　　the attribute and factor statements in the procedural parts of the rules contain specifications for most of the potential interactions among system components. attributes and factors either have constant values or have values that depend on attributes of constituents and global information  such as a model of the discourse or the results of preliminary  low-level acoustic processing . by design  the attributes and factors of a phrase are not allowed to depend on the context formed by other phrases that can combine with it to produce larger structures. by giving up explicit context dependency  it becomes easier to share phrases among different contexts  which allows the executive to reduce duplication of effort. however  contextual restrictions provide heuristic information that in practice is too valuable to ignore  so the executive algorithms for priority setting take them into account by special techniques described below. essentially  we have taken the explicit context dependencies out of the rules so that phrases can be shared by different contexts  and have developed methods in the executive so that contextual restrictions can s t i l l be used in controlling the operation of the system. 
　　　the form of the rules is designed to avoid commitments to particular system control strategies. for example  the rule procedures can be executed with any subset of constituents  so incomplete phrases can be constructed to provide intermediate results  and it is not necessary to acquire constituents in a s t r i c t l y l e f t - t o - r i g h t order this f l e x i b i l i t y has made it possible to experiment with alternative system control strategies. 
	iv 	syntax 
　　　the syntactic knowledge in the system is represented both in the phrase structure part of the language definition rules and in the attribute 
　　　
and factor statements in the procedural part of the 
such as the semantic network representation of the

rules. syntax provides computationally inexpensive information about which words or phrases may combine and how well they go together. in testing word or phrase combinations  syntactic information alone often can reject an incorrect phrase without requiring costly semantic and discourse analysis factors are used for traditional syntactic tests such as agreement for person or number  but factors also are used to reduce the scores of unexpected phrases. for example  wh questions that are negative  e.g.  what submarine doesn't the u.s own    are not expected to occur. a factor statement lowers the value for this interpretation but does not eliminate it completely  so that if no better hypothesis can be formed to account for the input utterance  this interpretation w i l l be 
accepted. since the language definition system provides the capability for evaluating phrases in context by means of non-boolean factors  the grammar can be tuned to particular discourse situations and language users simply by adjusting factors that enhance or diminish the acceptability of particular interpretations. it is not necessary to rewrite the language definition for each new problem domain 
　　　the constituent structures defined by the composition rules in the system allow wh questions  how many questions. how+adiective questions  imperatives and statements; be and do verb forms are included. noun phrases can be of a variety of types. we have concentrated on those relevant for the domain having wh determiners  what  which  whose   quantifiers   a l l . any  both  each either  every  neither no  none  some   partitive expressions  containing  of   expressions with numbers  from one through the millions  and units  tons  feet  knots   and comparisons involving numbers. there are more than 1 different kinds of basic noun phrases  to which may be added recursively  of np  expressions and some classes of prepositional phrases. the lexicon contains over 1 entries; regular plurals  past and past participle forms and other suffixes are handled by rules. 
	v 	semantics 
　　　the system's knowledge about the domain is embodied in-a partitioned semantic network. a semantic network consists of a collection of nodes and arcs where each node represents an object  a physical object  situation  event  set  or the like  and each arc represents a binary relationship. the structure of our network differs from that of conventional networks in that nodes and arcs are partitioned into spaces. these spaces  playing in networks a role roughly analogous to that played by parentheses in logical notation  group information into bundles that help to condense and organize the network's knowledge. network partitioning serves a variety of purposes in the speech understanding system: encoding logical connectives and higher-order predicates  especially quantifiers; associating syntactic units with their network images; interrelating new inputs with previous network knowledge while maintaining a definite boundary between the new and the old; simultaneously encoding in one network structure multiple hypotheses concerning alternative incorporations of a given constituent into larger phrases; sharing network representations among competing hypotheses; maintaining intermediate results during the question-answering process; and defining hierarchies of local contexts for discourse analysis. 
　　　the network includes an encoding of knowledge about the domain of discourse. this model serves as a foundation on which the structures corresponding to new utterances are b u i l t ; it is used to assess the feasibility of combining utterance constituents to form larger phrases; and it is a source of information for answering queries  supplemented by a relational data base which can be accessed directly from the network. 
　　　concepts in the domain that can be referenced by individual words are so listed in the lexicon. as lexical items are combined into phrases  these network references are passed to semantic composition routines. these routines construct new network structures that represent the meanings of the composite phrase  encoding new instances or new combinations of concepts. as phrases are combined into larger phrase units the composition routines are applied until an interpretation for the entire utterance has been constructed in this process  case relations provide a basis for using syntactic information in constructing semantic interpretations; they also allow rejecting unallowable semantic structures and blocking syntactic predictions for words that cannot f i t in the current context. the interpretation for the entire utterance takes the form of a network fragment anchored to concepts in the original domain model  but maintained in a separate partition called a scratch space 
　　　the scoping of quantifiers  contained implicitly or e x p l i c i t l y in the utterance  is performed in a separate step after an interpretation has been assigned to the total input. scoping is accomplished by adding new partitioning to the network fragment without changing the topology of the existing structure. 
　　　once a network structure encoding a fully quantified interpretation of an input is formulated  it is passed to a response component. for questions and commands requesting information  calls to a deduction component are generated to retrieve or derive the requested information from the network encoding of the domain model. 
	vi 	discourse 
　　　the discourse component of the speech understanding system relates a given utterance  or a portion of i t   to the overall dialog context and to entities and structures in the domain. the procedures we have developed are based on systematic studies of dialogs between two people performing some a c t i v i t y together. contextual influences were found to operate on two different levels in a discourse. the global context-the total discourse and situational setting-provides one set of constraints on the interpretation of an utterance. these constraints are used in identifying the referents of definite noun phrases. 
the second set of constraints is provided by the 
　see walker  1  and flkes and hendrix  1  for a description of the deduction component. immediate context of closely preceding utterances. these constraints are used in the interpretation of e l l i p t i c a l expressions to expand utterance fragments into complete utterances. for the data base domain of the speech understanding system  the discourse context is limited to a linear history of preceding interactions for complex task-oriented dialogs the linear discourse history can be replaced by a structured history related to the organization of the task being performed  see grosz 1arb . 
　　　to determine the referents of definite noun phrases  it is necessary to group those parts of the global knowledge base  that is the knowledge about the domain of discourse  that are in the focus of attention of the dialog participants. to encode this focus  we have introduced a special partitioning that is independent of the logical partitioning used to represent semantic information. spaces in the focus partitioning are u1ed to group together and highlight those items in the knowledge base that are relevant at a given point in a dialog. 
　　　the central process necessary for resolving definite noun phrases is finding a network structure that matches the semantic structure built for the noun phrase. the matching is performed by the deduction component  which associates nodes and arcs in the network fragment corresponding to the noun phrase with nodes and arcs in the knowledge base. the focus representation is used to constrain the search required by this matching process on the basis of the discourse context. 
　　　the constituents missing from an e l l i p t i c a l utterance are found in the interpretation of the immediately preceding utterance. the process of building an interpretation for an e l l i p t i c a l phrase entails two steps. first  the items missing from the current utterance are found in the interpretation of the preceding utterance  or  equlvalently  the slot that the e l l i p t i c a l phrase f i l l s in the preceding utterance is determined  syntactic information plays a major role in this identification  because the corresponding elements usually are structural units of the same type. semantic closeness  determined from the taxonomic hierarchy of the network  also is considered. second  a complete phrase is built using the e l l i p t i c a l phrase and the missing constituents found in the previous utterance. the coordination of syntactic and semantic information  achieved through network partitioning  is used to minimize the- computation required. 
	vii 	executive 
the executive has three main responsibilities: 
 1  it coordinates the work of the other components of the system by calling acoustic processes and applying language definition rules;  1  it assigns p r i o r i t i e s to the various tasks in the system; and  1  it organizes hypotheses and results so that information is shared and duplication of effort is avoided. when a successful interpretation has been found  the executive invokes the response functions  which produce a reply. 
　　　the principal data structure used by the executive is called the parse net. it is a network with two types of nodes phrases and predictions. phrases correspond to words or composition rules from the language definition; phrases can be complete  containing a l l their constituents  or incomplete  with some or a l l of their constituents 
missing a prediction is for a particular category of phrase associated with a particular location in the utterance. as the interpretation of an utterance progresses  new phrases that have been constructed from existing phrases or from words found in the utterance are added to the parse net. at the same time  new predictions are made as more information is obtained. thus  as the interpretation process advances  the parse net. which holds intermediate hypotheses and results  grows. a complete root category phrase  typically  a sentence  with i t s attributes and factors constitutes an interpretation of the utterance 
　　　there are two tasks entailed in maintaining and evolving this parse net: the word task and the predict task the role of the word task is to look for a particular word in a particular location in the utterance. if the acoustic mapper has not been called previously to test for that word in that location  the word task calls i t . if a word is found successfully in the specified location the word is used to build new phrases. 
　　　the role of the predict task is to make a prediction for a word or phrase that can help complete an incomplete phrase. whenever a new constituent is inserted into an incomplete phrase  any adjacent constituents that had been missing can be predicted. new predictions can include predictions for particular words  leading to new instances of calls on the word task. 
　　　a prediction serves as an intermediary between two sets of incomplete phrases* consumer phrases that a l l are missing a constituent of the predicted category at the predicted location in the input  and producer phrases that a l l might supply the missing constituents note that a phrase can be a consumer for one prediction and a producer for another. the f u l l set of producer-consumer connections in the parse net makes explicit the different sentential contexts for each phrase. this contextual information is used by the executive in setting priorities and in lookahead. 
　　　establishing the priority of a task begins with determining the score of the phrase involved. the score is computed from the results of the acoustic mapping of any of the words contained in the phrase  from the factor statements for the phrase  and from the scores of the constituents. the score is thus a local  context-free piece of information about how good the phrase is. after the score is determined  the phrase is given a rating that is an estimate of the best score for an interpretation that can be constructed for a phrase of the root  sentence  category that uses the given phrase. the rating for a phrase does depend on i t s consumers  that i s   on the other phrases in which it may be embedded to form a sentence. this rating is then modified depending on the control strategy being used  and the result is the priority of the task to be performed for that phrase. 
　the design of the parse net was inspired by kaplan's  1  multi-processing consumer-producer approach.

       both the word and the p r e d i c t task can work e i t h e r l e f t - t o - r i g h t through an i n p u t or b i d i r e c t i o n a l l y from words selected at a r b i t r a r y p o s i t i o n s w i t h i n an utterance. the system is designed to a l l o w c o n s t i t u e n t s of phrases to be added in any order  so experimentation w i t h a v a r i e t y of c o n t r o l s t r a t e g i e s has been p o s s i b l e . more i m p o r t a n t l y from the system c o n t r o l s t a n d p o i n t   each task does a l i m i t e d amount of processing and then stops a f t e r scheduling f u r t h e r operations for l a t e r . the scheduling does not s p e c i f y a p a r t i c u l a r time for a f u t u r e operation but instead gives the operation a c e r t a i n p r i o r i t y . the operation is performed when it becomes top p r i o r i t y . this o r g a n i z a t i o n allows the executive to c o n t r o l the o v e r a l l a c t i v i t y of the system by s e t t i n g task p r i o r i t i e s . 
	v i i i 	ental results 
       we have experimented w i t h two techniques for using the consumer context in s e t t i n g phrase r a t i n g s in one. c a l l e d the merging method  the r a t i n g w i t h respect to a p a r t i c u l a r consumer is formed by adding the phrase score and the consumer r a t i n g .  whenever p o s s i b l e   r a t i n g s are assigned top-down in the parse net so t h a t consumer r a t i n g s are d i r e c t l y a v a i l a b l e for use in t h i s process   the phrase r a t i n g is then the maximum r a t i n g w i t h respect to any of i t s consumers. this method is f a s t   but it leaves the r a t i n g unaffected by the consumer r e s t r i c t i o n s t h a t are expressed in r u l e procedures r a t h e r than i n s t r u c t u r e d e c l a r a t i o n s . a phrase may s a t i s f y the s t r u c t u r a l requirements of a consumer c but s t i l l be incompatible w i t h c because of c o n s t r a i n t s encoded in c s f a c t o r statements. for example  if the only s e n t e n t i a l context being considered is   i s it owned by -     the s t r u c t u r a l requirements w i l l be s a t i s f i e d by any noun phrase  but semantic f a c t o r s w i l l r e s t r i c t the a l t e r n a t i v e s to possible owners. 
       the second technique for s e t t i n g phrase r a t i n g s i s c a l l e d the context-checking method. i t takes i n t o account the procedural i n f o r m a t i o n in the r u l e s by e x p l o r i n g paths in the parse net and executing the corresponding procedures to gather a t t r i b u t e and f a c t o r i n f o r m a t i o n . each producerconsumer path from a phrase p to a r o o t category phrase r e f l e c t s a way of c o n s t r u c t i n g an i n t e r p r e t a t i o n using p. various paths from p are formed  and the r a t i n g f o r p is i t s best r a t i n g w i t h respect to any of the constructed paths. 
       to reduce the cost of r a t i n g a l t e r n a t i v e s by the context-checking method  a h e u r i s t i c search is made in the parse net f o r a near optimal path r a t h e r than e x h a u s t i v e l y t r y i n g a l l p o s s i b i l i t i e s . the h e u r i s t i c e x p l o i t s the f a c t t h a t   t y p i c a l l y   when a phrase is being r a t e d   the higher l e v e l phrases t h a t form i t s context have already been r a t e d .  the parse net is i n i t i a l i z e d so t h a t a context of p r e v i o u s l y r a t e d phrases e x i s t s even when the system is doing bottom-up processing.  these p r i o r r a t i n g s provide important h e u r i s t i c i n f o r m a t i o n . the o b j e c t is to f i n d the path g i v i n g 
       the best score  so the paths w i t h the highest p r i o r r a t i n g are explored f i r s t . when a complete path is found  one t h a t leads to a r o o t - c a t e g o r y phrase  the score f o r t h a t path is used as a t h r e s h o l d to prune other paths t h a t have lower expected r a t i n g s . 
       the context-checking method takes more computation per r a t i n g assignment than the merging method but it produces b e t t e r phrase r a t i n g s since it gathers more i n f o r m a t i o n in forming them. the experimental r e s u l t s support the conclusion t h a t the extra e f f o r t spent in t h i s method is 
w o r t h w h i l e ; it leads to b e t t e r system performance as r e f l e c t e d in both accuracy and runtime as a background for c o n s i d e r a t i o n o f these r e s u l t s i t is necessary to consider b r i e f l y the scope of the experimental e f f o r t as a whole. 
       the experiments to determine the e f f e c t s of v a r i a t i o n s in c o n t r o l s t r a t e g y for our speech understanding system were conducted using a simulated version of the acoustic processing components as i n d i c a t e d above although we l o s t access to the mapper as a r e s u l t of the removal of the computer f a c i l i t y on which the t o t a l system was being implemented  there are compelling reasons f o r doing s i m u l a t i o n experiments. extensive t e s t i n g 
       w i t h the a c t u a l mapper would have been impossible both because of the time required and because of increased demands on memory w i t h the l a r g e delays for page swapping by the time sharing system. in a d d i t i o n we were able to study c o n t r o l s t r a t e g i e s t h a t otherwise would have been too slow for the

       the mapper s i m u l a t i o n reproduces the observed mapper performance s t a t i s t i c s for the f a l s e - a l a r m r a t e the h i t scores and the p a r t i c u l a r f a l s e alarm words and t h e i r scores because of i n s u f f i c i e n t data  we were not able to simulate more complex s t a t i s t i c s such as the cooccurrence of h i t s and f a l s e alarms or the dependence of scores on p o s i t i o n w i t h i n the utterance. consequently  the experiments are designed to emphasize comparisons between performance l e v e l s for the d i f f e r e n t design a l t e r n a t i v e s and should not be taken as estimates of the absolute value of the system's performance w i t h a r e a l mapper for t h i s reason we do not consider here the e f f e c t i v e n e s s of the system as a whole  although there are observations t h a t are r e l e v a n t for an e v a l u a t i o n of the o v e r a l l r e s u l t s of the arpa speech understanding research program  see the sections on experimental studies in paxton 1  or walker  1 . 
       in the main experiment of the s e r i e s   the performance of the speech understanding system  w i t h a l e x i c o n of 1 words  was measured on a set of 1 t e s t sentences  while v a r y i n g four major c o n t r o l - s t r a t e g y design choices. the sentences covered a wide range of vocabulary and included q u e s t i o n s   commands  and e l l i p t i c a l sentences. the 1 sentences ranged in length from 1 to 1 seconds. there were 1 sentences at each 1 second i n t e r v a l . the sentences averaged 1 words in l e n g t h   w i t h a maximum of 1 words. 
       i n a d d i t i o n t o studying the e f f e c t s o f context checking  we also examined the f o l l o w i n g a l t e r n a t i v e s : 
* to island drive or. not: go in both directions from arbitrary starting points in the input versus proceed s t r i c t l y l e f t to right from the beginning. island driving allows interpretations to be b u i l t up around words that match well anywhere in the input. 
* to map a l l or one: 	t e s t a l l the words at

once at a given location versus trying them one at a time and delaying further testing when a good match is found. mapping a l l at once identifies the best acoustic candidates and reduces the chances of following false paths  but it takes substantially more time. 
* to focus or not. assign priorities for tasks focusing on selected alternatives by inhibiting competion or proceed each time 
         with the task with the highest score. all combinations of the four control-strategy variables were tested on the 1 sentences. this experimental design allows us to compare the 1 combinations of control choices and to evaluate  by analysis of variance the effects of the control strategy variables  that is the change in performance each produces averaged over a l l the possibilities for the other variables. the probabilities associated with an effect are expressed as p .1  p  1  and p .1  corresponding to the different likelihoods that the effect is the result of random variation. 
　　　we w i l l discuss here only the results that show the effects of context checking. the most important performance measures for the system are accuracy  the percentage of sentences for which the correct sequence of words is found  and runtime  the computation required by the system  including simulated acoustic processing time . in the rest of this section  these variables w i l l be considered in order as the results demonstrate the effects of context checking. 
　　　first  however it should be noted that the control strategy affects accuracy only indirectly: a l l the strategies are complete in the sense that they only reorder  and never eliminate  alternatives. if there were no false alarms  a l l the systems would get 1% of the test sentences correct  even with false alarms the strategies would get an equal percent correct  if a l l the possible alternatives could be tried before the system picked an interpretation. errors would only occur when false alarms had high enough scores to displace hits in the highest rated interpretations. however  in the actual system  the large number of alternatives makes it impossible to consider a l l of them in the space and time available. as a result  the order in which the alternatives are considered can affect the accuracy  and so can the demands on space and time. control strategy thus affects accuracy indirectly by reordering alternatives and by modifying space and time requirements. to explain the accuracy effects  we must look at these other factors. 
　　　in this experiment  the storage limit had an important influence on accuracy. 	in the 1 tests  1 sentences times 1 systems  	1  1$  were correct and 1  1%  were wrong. 	of the errors  
1  1%  had an incorrect interpretation  while 1  1$  had no interpretation at a l l . since the systems could potentially get the correct answer  and no time limit was imposed until at least one interpretation had been found a l l of the 1 sentences with no interpretation were a result of running out of storage. 
　　　the storage limit used in the tests was based on the number of phrases constructed when the total reached 1  the system would stop trying new alternatives and if any interpretation had been found pick the highest rated interpretation as i t s answer the average number of phrases constructed over a l l systems was 1 nonterminal and 1 terminal. the system with the best accuracy  which included context checking  had the lowest average  1 nonterminals and 1 terminals  while the system with the worst accuracy  without context checking had one of the highest averages  1 nonterminals and 1 terminals . overall there was a strong negative correlation  - 1  between system accuracy and average number of phrases constructed. for the 1 system configurations  the values for accuracy ranged from 1$ to 1$ averaged over the systems  the inclusion of context checking provided an increase in accuracy of 1$  p .1. configurations with context checking constructed on the average 1 phrases; those without constructed 1; this difference is significant  p  1. surprisingly  context checking also results in a significant reduction in the false terminal percentage -- from 1$ to 1$ p .1. this reduction may be evidence that context checking is giving lower priority to looking for words adjacent to false alarms than it gives to looking next to hits. this change could affect the false terminal likelihood  since there is always a hit adjacent to a h i t   while false alarms often have nothing but other false alarms next to them. in addition to its effect on false terminals  context checking may also be improving the storage requirements and accuracy by generally improving the priority setting  thereby reducing the likelihood of following false paths. 
　　　the important role of the storage limit raises the question of whether the accuracy effects would have disappeared if more storage had been available. we believe that the effects would have been smaller but s t i l l important. the effects on the proportion of false terminal phrases would remain  as would the effects on p r i o r i t i e s . a smaller percentage of false terminals and better priorities w i l l cause the system to find the correct interpretation sooner and. even if the storage limit were relaxed  the limit on runtime would remain to penalize systems that were slow to find the right answer. the effects of control strategy choices on accuracy would vanish only if space and runtime limitations were both removed. 
　　　the system runtime is another important performance measure. here  we w i l l use the phrase total runtime  to refer to the simulated acoustic processing  plus the actual processing time  on a dec pdp ka-1  for the executive and the semantic components. the executive time is mainly spent setting priorities and parsing. the semantics time is used in constructing semantic translations and in dealing with anaphoric references and e l l i p s i s . the reported total runtime does not include acoustic preprocessing or question answering  since neither is affected by the experimental variables. we report results only for t o t a l   executive  and acoustic times; semantic times are not reported  both because they are redundant given the other three measures  and because they are relatively small in comparison to the others.

1 　　　for the 1 system configurations  the values for runtime ranged from 1 to 1 seconds per sentence. 	context checking was the only control 
v a r i a b l e to reduce t o t a l runtime the d i f f e r e n c e in seconds per sentence of processing time  from 1 to 1  was s i g n i f i c a n t   p   . 1 . separating executive and acoustic runtimes from the t o t a l again showed t h a t in both cases  context checks decrease the runtime. for executive runtime  the d i f f e r e n c e is from 1 to 1 seconds p  1; for acoustic runtime  the d i f f e r e n c e is from 1 to 1 seconds p  1 . 
       i t i s noteworthy that the e x t r a e f f o r t for context checking r e s u l t e d in a net decrease in processing time. for example the best system c o n f i g u r a t i o n   which included context checking  spent an average of 1 seconds per sentence doing extra processing for the context checks; however  t h i s was s t i l l 1 seconds per sentence f a s t e r than the system configured in the same way but without doing the context checking. 
       in summary  context checking had uniformly good e f f e c t s . for both accuracy and runtime  it was worth the extra e f f o r t to get b e t t e r p r i o r i t y s e t t i n g . this r e s u l t c l e a r l y depends on the fact t h a t we put a large amount of the system's knowledge i n t o the r u l e procedures of the language d e f i n i t i o n r a t h e r than i n t o the s t r u c t u r a l d e c l a r a t i o n s . it would be of considerable i n t e r e s t to provide a d i r e c t experimental t e s t of the e f f e c t s of varying the s t y l e of the language d e f i n i t i o n . for example  while keeping the scope of the language constant  a greater amount of the l i n g u i s t i c knowledge could be encoded in the r u l e s t r u c t u r e s rather than in the r u l e procedures. such an experiment would provide i n f o r m a t i o n about the performance e f f e c t s of the d i f f e r e n t r e p r e s e n t a t i o n a l s t y l e s and would i n d i c a t e the extent to which the e f f e c t s of design features such as context-checking for assigning r a t i n g s are dependent on a p a r t i c u l a r s t y l e of language d e f i n i t i o n . in drawing conclusions from such an experiment  we would be g e n e r a l i z i n g both over the population of input sentences and over the population o f language d e f i n i t i o n s t y l e s .
