introduction the scheduling of sport leagues has become an important class of combinatorial optimization applications in recent years since they represent significant sources of revenue and generate extremely challenging optimization problems. this paper considers the travelling tournament problem  tip  proposed in  to abstract the salient features of major league baseball  mlb  in the united states. the key to the mlb schedule is a conflict between minimizing travel distances and feasibility constraints on the home/away patterns. travel distances are a major issue in mlb because of the number of teams and the fact that teams go on  road trips  to visit several opponents before returning home. the feasibility constraints in the mlb restricts the number of successive games that can be played at home or away. 
¡¡the ttp is an abstraction of the mlb intended to stimulate research in sport scheduling. a solution to the ttp is a double round-robin tournament which satisfies sophisticated feasibility constraints  e.g.  no more than three away games in a row  and minimizes the total travel distances of the teams.  argues that  without an approach to the ttp  it is unlikely that suitable schedules can be obtained for the mlb. the ttp has raised significant interest in recent years since the challenge instances were proposed.  describes both constraint and integer programming approaches to the ttp which generate high-quality solutions.  explores a lagrangian relaxation approach  together with constraint programming techniques  which improves some of the results. other lower and upper bounds are given in   although the details of how they are obtained does not seem to be available. 
problem description the problem was introduced by easton  nemhauser and trick  1; 1   which contains many interesting discussion on sport scheduling. an input consists of n teams  n even  and an n x n symmetric matrix d   such that dij represents the distance between the homes of teams t  and tj. a solution is a schedule in which each team plays with each other twice  once in each team's home. such a schedule is called a double round-robin tournament. it should be clear that a double round-robin tournament has 1n - 1 rounds. for a given schedule 1  the cost of a team as the total distance that it has to travel starting from its home  playing the scheduled games in 1  and returning back home. the cost of a solution is defined as the sum of the cost of every team. 
¡¡the goal is to find a schedule with minimum cost satisfying the following two constraints:  1  at most constraints: no more than three consecutive home or away games are allowed for any team.  1  norepeat constraints: a game of at home cannot be followed by a game of at home. as a consequence  a double round-robin schedule is feasible if it satisfies the atmost and norepeat constraints and is infeasible otherwise. a schedule is conveniently represented by a table indicating the opponents of the teams. each line corresponds to a team and each column corresponds to a round. the opponent of team at round is given by the absolute value of element  i  k . if  i  k  is positive  the game takes place at home  otherwise at tvs opponent home. consider for instance the schedule s for 1 teams  and thus 1 rounds .

observe that long stretches of games at home do not contribute to the travel cost but are limited by the atmost constraints. this kind of tension is precisely why this problem is hard to solve in practice.

the local search this paper proposes an advanced simulated annealing algorithm  ttsa  for the ttp. as usual  the algorithm starts from an initial configuration. its basic step moves from the current configuration c to a configuration in the neighborhood of c. ttsa is based on four main design decisions.  1  constraints are separated into two groups: hard constraints  which are always satisfied by the configurations  and soft constraints  which may or may not be violated. the hard constraints are the round-robin constraints  while the soft constraints are the no-repeat and atmost constraints. in other words  all configurations in the search represents a double round-robin tournament  which may or may not violate the no-repeat and atmost constraints. exploring the infeasible region seems to be particularly important for this problem. obviously  to drive the search toward feasible solutions  ttsa modifies the original objective function to include a penalty term.  1  ttsa is based on a large neighborhood of size  where n is the number of teams. some of these moves can be regarded as a form of ejection chains which is often used in tabu search  1; 1 .  1  ttsa dynamically adjusts the objective function to balance the time spent in the feasible and infeasible regions. this adjustments resembles the strategic oscillation idea 1  successfully in tabu search to sohe generalized assignment problems   although the details differ since simulated annealing is used as the meta-heuristics.  1  ttsa also uses reheats  e.g.   1  to escape local minima at low temperatures. the  reheats  increase the temperature again and divide the search in several phases. 
the neighborhood the neighborhood consists of four different moves. among them  partial swaps of rounds and teams are critical to find high-quality solutions. consider the move partialswaprounds s  tt rk  r1 . this move considers team ti and swaps its games at rounds rk and r1. then the rest of the schedule for rounds rk and r1 is updated  in a deterministic way  to produce a double round-robin tournament. consider the schedule s

this move can thus be regarded as a form of ejection chain  1; 1 . finding which games to swap is not difficult: it suffices to find the connected component which contains the games of ti in rounds and in the graph where the vertices are the teams and where an edge contains two teams if they play against each other in rounds and all the teams in this component must have their games swapped. note that there are  such moves. 
experiments ttsa was applied to the national league benchmark described in 1; 1 . over the course of this research  ttsa was able to match the best solutions for nl1  nl1  and nl1  and to improve the solutions for nl1  nl1  
nl1  and nl1 significantly. the best existing solutions were those in  and were the best to our knowledge at the time of writing. the last update was on november 1  1. ttsa is the first algorithm to go lower than 1 for 1 teams and 1 for 1 teams. the results arc summarized table 1. observe that even our worst results on these instances improve the previous best solutions.
