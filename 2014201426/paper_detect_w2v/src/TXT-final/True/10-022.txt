ion on the subject p o s i t i o n .  again  one probably need only search for such predicates in the current sentence if it has several clauses or in the one or two sentences immediately preceding i t   as the h a l f - l i f e of predicate antecedents  l i k e that of type antecedents  seems to be very short. note that we are viewing the f i r s t argument place of a predicate as corresponding to surface subject position. though this requires a d i f f e r e n t representation for active and passive sentences  we see the need for this on other grounds  for example  their difference with respect to simple verb phrase deletion: 
　　john h i t a l i n g u i s t fred did too. as opposed to 
john was h i t by a l i n g u i s t . 
fred was too. 
*fred ~~dtd too. 
　　this example is simple in that there is only one such one-place predicate 
abstractable off a subject: 
	x r   ex:t-shirt  	. gave r  sue  x  
that 	i s   	giving 	sue 	a 	t - s h i r t . 
substituting for p  yields 
　　jane  x   r   i   e x : t - s h i r t   . gave r sue xj which is equivalent to 
 ex:t-shirt  . gave jane  sue x 
note that this representation does not commit us to both g i r l s having given sue the same t - s h i r t   nor need they be d i f f e r e n t . the description of the f i r s t one is flz: t-shirt z & gave mary  sue  z 
 a t-shirt that mary gave sue   where   indicates the i n d e f i n i t e operator.  z might be called in english  the t-shirt which mary gave sue  if no other t-shirt in the discourse meets this description.  
the second t-shirt is describable as 
v w: t-shirt w & gave jane  sue w 
 a t-shirt that jane gave sue . 
　　it is important to be able to derive such descriptions  since the e n t i t i e s they describe may serve as antecedents for later anaphoric expressions  for example  1c. neither of them f i t her. 
natural lan*ua*e-1: nash-webber 1 where  them  refers to the i m p l i c i t set of t-shirts given to sue  who is also the most plausible antecedent of  her .

	* 	sloppy 	identity 
　　our ne xt ex ample i l l u s t r a t e s a phenomenon that h as been called the  sloppy ide n t i t y problem   ross  1  . it involves account ing for the appearance of an addi tional reading for sentences containing d eleted verb phr ases. that i s   while sente nee 1a seems unambiguous  sentence 1b migh t mean e ither that fred beats garth' s wife or that he beats his own. how do we ace ount for this  
1a. garth beats his wife  
b. fred does too. 
　　we assign 1a. an i n i t i a l representation in which i t s anaphoric term is overtly 
marked. 
	1c. beat garth  	's wife he1 
 where 's is defined to be a function that takes a unary predicate l i k e wife  school  e t c .   and returns a function l i k e  wife-of    school-of   etc. 's wife   for example  is a function that takes a man as i t s argument and returns his wife: 's wife john is john's wife. having a function l i k e 's eliminates the need to postulate a separate  y-of  function for every unary predicate y.  
　　with no other male around  we can assign he  to garth by default  that i s   
	1d. beat garth  	's wife garth 
we assign sentence 1b. the 	representation 
1e. p  fred 
now  while there are no e x p l i c i t one-place predicates around to serve as an antecedent for p   there are two ways in which to abstract one from 1d. 
	 i  	  r  beat r  	's wife garth  
	  i i   y r   beat r  	's wife r  
the f i r s t represents beating garth's wife and the second  beating one's own. substituting for p   we get the two plausible readings 
	fred  	  r  beat r  	's wife garth  
	fred  y r  beat r  	's wife r  
that i s   either fred beats garth's wife or he beats his own. 
　　 while we have not done so here  it is actually important to distinguish whether an argument place was o r i g i n a l l y f i l l e d by an anaphoric expression or by a f u l l noun phrase. observe that if sentence 1a. had read  garth beats garth's w i f e     which would be represented simply as 1d.  the following sentence   fred does too   could 
only mean that fred beats garth's wife. thus in an actual implementation  we would have to indicate  he = garth   rather than simply replacing  he  with  garth   in order to derive a l l and only the correct lambda abstractions.  
	1' 	abstracting 	predicates 	from 
non-subject 	position 
　　the point of the next ex ample is to i l l u s t r a t e abstracting one-place predicates from positions oth er than the surface subject. in english    1ikewise    too     s i m i l a r l y     etc.   followed optionally by a preposition and then by a noun phrase indicate that the role f i l l e d by the new noun phrase in a previously mentioned predicate is a non-subject one.  as i l l u s t r a t e d e a r l i e r   a noun phrase followed by an auxiliary requ ires that the noun phrase f i l l s the subject role of a previous predicate.  
1a. john h i t a cop. 
b. likewise  a cia agent. 
the f i r s t sentence may be represented as 
　　1c.  ex.-cop  . hit john  x and the second one as 
	1d. 	 ey:cia-agent  . q  y 
where g  stands for an anaphoric predicate like p   but one whose argument f i l l s a non-subject role. 
　　to resolve 1    we must identify the one-place predicates that can be abstracted from non-subject positions. from 1c.  we get 
　　    r     h i t john  r  which  substituted for $  in 1d.  yields 
　　 ey:cia-agent  . y     r  hit john  r  or more simply  
　　 ey:cia-agent  . hit john  y that i s    likewise  john h i t a cia agent.  
	it 	might appear that one could resolve 
 likewise -ellipses at the level of the surface string alone  but this is not the case. consider the following example: 
1a. john gave sally her present  
b. likewise  fred. 
natural langua ge-1: nash-webber obviously  while substituting  fred  for  sally  in the surface string would yield an interpretable sentence   john gave fred her present   t h i s is not the only  nor the most plausible reading of the e l l i p s i s in 1b. 
we represent 1a. as 
　　1c. gave john  sally  's  present  she. which we interpret as 
	1d. gave john  sally  	's present sally 
she 	being 	the 	only 	female 	around. 
sentence 1b.  we represent as 
1e.  fred 
to resolve     we identify the one-place predicates that may be abstracted from non-subject positions. from 1d.  we get substituting c l a r i t y   we get 
	-gave john  fred  	's present sally 
 likewise  john gave fred sally's present.  
	-gave john  fred  	's present fred 
 likewise  john gave fred fred's present.  
-gave john  sally  fred 
 likewise  john gave sally fred.  
again  the preferred interpretation would be chosen by using world knowledge. 
c. 	 donkeys  
　　as our f i n a l example of how an appropriate logical representation of a sentence can yield antecedents necessary for anaphor resolution  we w i l l consider a p a r t i c u l a r l y bothersome class of sentences  i l l u s t r a t e d by example 1. 
1. every man who owns a donkey beats i t . 
the problem li es in identifying the antecedent of  i t   . it is not  a donkey   the sentence do es not mean that every man who owns a donk ey beats a donkey  but rather that he beats any donkey that he owns. moreover   there is  no way of construing the e x i s t e n t i a l quantifier associated with  a donkey  such that   i t   f a l l s within i ts scope. how does the correct antecede nt for   i t   emerge from our framework  
	we 	f i r s t 	assign 	sentence 	1 	the 
interpretation 
	natural 	langua 

that i s   for every man for whom there is some donkey that he owns  he beats i t . now while there is nothing e x p l i c i t to serve as the antecedent for   i t     it turns out that   i t   can also reference a certain kind of functional entity which arises from e x i s t e n t i a l s . 
　　we postulate the following rule for identifying a possible antecedent for it. 
1. find a type r e s t r i c t i o n which contains an e x i s t e n t i a l l y quantified variable y not within the scope of either a universal quantifier or negation. 
1. determine the description of y with respect to this type r e s t r i c t i o n : any e n t i t y which s a t i s f i e s this description is a possible antecedent for it.  again  we omit the specification of the rule for determining y's description  although one should be clear from the example.  
for i .   there is one such type r e s t r i c t i o n 
-   ey:donkey  . own u   y   . the description of the e x i s t e n t i a l l y quantified y is 
i i . 
that i s   it is a function which  given a u  returns a donkey that u owns if u owns a donkey. for a given x then  

is a donkey that x owns  substituting into i. yields 
i i i . 
　　notice that this rule is independent of how the type containing the e x i s t e n t i a l has been quantified. thus  in 
1. some man who owns a donkey beats 	i t . 
1. which man who owns a donkey beats tt  
the antecedent of   i t   is the donkey obtained by applying function   i i   to the quantified variable associated with  man . 
v
	  	discussion 
　　the examples of section iv were designed to i l l u s t r a t e the f e a s i b i l i t y of deriving possible antecedents for anaphoric expressions d i r e c t l y from an appropriately structured logical representation. notice that basic to this representation is an adequate indication of the scope of logical operators -
nash-webber 

1 

q u a n t i f i e r s   conjunction and negation for otherwise  we could not deal correctly with antecedents arising from existentials 
   e . g .   the examples in sections iv.a and iv.d . also basic is the recognition and correct attachment of modifiers - relative clauses  prepositional phrases  prenominal modifiers  etc. - necessary for correctly handling  one  anaphora  e.g.  section iv.b . taken together  these impose the requirement of a pre-processor for mapping surface strings onto logical forms at least as powerful as that of the lunar system  woods et a l   1 . it follows that much of the burden of antecedent i d e n t i f i c a t i o n is actually being placed upon this pre-processor  given the need for an appropriate logical form before our approach can be applied. 
　　it should also be clear that what we are describing in this paper is 
essentially a competence model for anaphor resolution. in ~ i t s crudest implementation  one would f i r s t generate a set of possible antecedents  and then test each of these by plausible reasoning using general world knowledge. of course  we are not seriously proposing such a generate and test implementation. there are a variety of heuristics that can be invoked to aid the choice of a most probable antecedent and any performance model must make use of such knowledge.  heuristics for assigning antecedents have been proposed throughout the l i n g u i s t i c s   psychology and ai l i t e r a t u r e s . see  nash-webber  1  for a discussion of many of them.  nevertheless  even a performance model must have the a b i l i t y to determine the space of possible alternatives from which such heuristics are to make their choice. since some of these alternatives may not be present e x p l i c i t l y   it is here that the approach of this paper becomes relevant. 
	v i   	further 	problems 
　　as this paper is necessarily brief  we do not have the space to discuss at length such i nteresting issues as the effects of negati on or various opaque contexts on the k i rid s of antecedents evoked. these are discus sed in  nash-webber  forthcoming . we wi 1   however  mention one such issue 
- the problem of existential noun phrases in neg ative contexts. 
　　the scope of negation is inherently ambiguous  and as with quantifiers  different scope interpretations yield d i f f e r e n t antecedents. moreover  some interpretations may yield no antecedent at a l l . for example  we know that in a positive context  an existential noun phrase w i l l always result in an entity which can be described in terms of that context. so  if john married a swedish g i r l    she  can refer to the swedish g i r l that john married. however  in a negative context   she  may refer to other e n t i t i e s depending on how the scope of negation is 
interpreted. 
negated vejrb 
1a. john d i d n ' t marry a swedish g i r l   b. he lived with he ♀ for three years. 
 she  = the swedish g i r l john was involved with 
negated modi f ie♀ 
	1a. john d i d n ' t marry a swedish 	g i r l   
b. she was from denmark. 
 she  = the g i r l john married 
negated main desc♀ijdtor 
	1a. john 	d i d n ' t marry a swedish g i r l   
b. she was at least 1 years hts senior. 
 she  = the swedish female john married 
negated proposition 
1a. john d i d n ' t catch a trout  
b. *he ate it for dinner. 
　　again  we would want to post ulate a neutral i n i t i a l representati on for negation  one that might be vag ue  but would nevertheless be true. only when we were required to e . g .   in o rder to resolve an anaphoric expression - would we then attempt to ma ke a commitmen t to the scope of negation   note that a belief context poses much the same pr oblem as negation  i.e. that of determin ing the scope of belief. fo r example  in 
1a. john thought he married a swedish g i r l   
	b. but she was really 	from 	denmark. 
as in example 1 above   she  is the g i r l that john married. here again  it is only the modifier  swedish  that should be 
taken 	as 	f a l l i n g 	within 	the 	scope 	of 
belief.  
　　as we mentioned e a r l i e r   before one can fix on a particular mrl  one must provide for mass concepts; for tense; for quantifiers other than universals and e x i s t e n t i a l s ; for facts  events  states or acts; and for generics  among other things  as the following examples i l l u s t r a t e .
