introduction 
a c r u c i a l problem in petroleum e x p l o r a t i o n is the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of measurements of c e r t a i n p h y s i c a l p r o p e r t i e s of underground rocks such a s d e n s i t y / e l e c t r i c a l r e s i s t i v i t y   sound t r a n s m i s s i o n   r a d i o a c t i v i t y . these measurements are represented by curves c a l l e d logs which are c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of the v a r i o u s rocks p e n e t r a t e d b y the d r i l l . 
in order to achieve t h e i r task of i n t e r p r e t a t i o n   g e o l o g i s t s use v a r i o u s s o r t s of knowledge. they take i n t o account q u a l i t a t i v e data  e.g  cambrian  has a c o n o t a t i o n o f  very o l d   and t h e r e f o r e 
suggests  a very compacted r o c k     as w e l l as q u a n t i t a t i v e data such as p e r m e a b i l i t y   p o r o s i t y   percentage o f c a l c i t e which are complementary to the logs numerical values themselves. 
s t a t i s t i c a l approaches used so f a r to i n t e r p r e t g e o l o g i c a l data have d r a s t i c l i m i t a t i o n s . these l i m i t a t i o n s are due to the f a c t t h a t some rocks   e . g . c h e r t s and q u a r t z i t e s   have s i m i l a r l o g responses and t h e r e f o r e can only be d i s t i n g u i s h e d on the ground of t h e i r g e o l o g i c a l environment  geography  s t r a t i g r a p h y   p a l e o n t o l o g y   .

related work and technical details 
litho is r e l a t e d to hasp/siap  1  which uses knowledge-based techniques f o r s i g n a l p r o c e s s i n g . ancestors of litho as expert systems in geology are prospector  1  and the dipmeter advisor   1   . prospector was p r i m a r i l y concerned w i t h h a r d - c r y s t a l l i n e rocks whereas the emphasis in litho is on sedimentary r o c k s . log i n t e r p r e t a t i o n has been a l r e a d y attempted w i t h the dipmeter advisor but only one l o g was i n t e r p r e t e d in d e t a i l . here  a l l the logs are accounted for   s o n i c   d e n s i t y   r e s i s t i v i t y   gamma-ray  e t c .   ; i n f o r m a t i o n e x t r a c t e d can be

furthermore  most of the knowledge about geology is very general  for example geography independent . 
litho is a new application of the emycin framework after mycin  sacon {1  among others. these systems rely strongly on the context-tree mechanism; on the other hand  litho makes a more extensive use of the certainty factors combination functions. the latter aspect seems to be inherent in geology where most of the inferences drawn are weak and where contradictions between data are not uncommon. 
litho is a complete interactive program using reasoning mechanisms acquired from human experts. it has the i n i t i a t i v e of the dialogue through which it acquires the data characterizing the well which has been d r i l l e d . litho now runs under two versions: the dec-1 version is written in interlisp and uses emycin  1   1; the vax version uses elithor a slightly simplified version of emycin written in franzlisp. a fortran  batch  program run on a vax currently gives the f i n a l output  vertical geology description  on a versatec. 
sources of data 
the primary goal of litho is to determine a set of most plausible lithofacies for each gross zone for example cherty limestone  tillite  ferrogineods sand  thin interbedding of varves  epsomite  etc. 
the values of the goal parameter are inferred using data parameters asked for during the consultation  geologic observations  morphologies of curves  etc.  and using various intermediate steps l i k e the main lithologic type  the paleoenvironment of deposition. the depth of the inference tree is about 1. in order to i l l u s t r a t e the combination of pattern recognition and expert systems techniques  this paper w i l l concentrate on the two main sources of knowledge which are the external  geological  data and the shapes of the curves. 
morphology of logs 
this is a primary source of data; there are two problems to be solved: f i r s t   the extraction of the important features of logs  second their interpretation within the reasoning mechanisms. this section w i l l describe f i r s t the vocabulary that we have developed to describe the curves  then how these features intervene in the reasoning and f i n a l l y the technique of pattern recognition used to extract these features. 
interesting features: the curves can be described in terms of whether there is indication of a c t i v i t y   f l a t or not   presence of plateaus  gamma-ray  r e s i s t i v i t y   neutron  e t c .     ramps  gamma-ray  etc.   beds 
 microresistivity  gamma-ray  e t c .     layers  hdt  microresistivity   strings  hdt only . from these data  the program infers the most plausible environments  main l i t h o l o g i c types and sometimes directly plausible lithofacies. as the pattern recognition program can miss micro-events which are d i f f i c u l t to recognise  the user has the possibility to complete the feature extraction by interpreting visually the logs. for this reason  s/he has a handbook providing some help for the recognition of the various shapes. 
hesitations do not block the deduction process since the user is permitted to introduce c r e d i b i l i t y factors weakening the inferences to be made. some of the shapes taken into account are l i s t e d below.  the observer is always looking upwards : 
plateaus: constant log response over an interval longer than 1 meters. megaramps: progressive increasing or decreasing response longer than 1 meters. massive beds: constant log answer over an interval comprised between 1 and 1 meters. 
an example of a  nearly  pure rule using the morphology of the logs is shown below: 
rule1: 
i f : 1  there is one or several plateaus on the fdc curve  and 
　　　1  there is one or several plateaus on the cnl curve  and 
　　　1  there is one or several plateaus on the bhc curve  and 
　　　1  the global porosity of the zone is less than 1 percent 
then: there is suggestive evidence  .1  that the geological formation of the zone is globally compacted. 
morphological analysis of logs: 
the major problems for an automatic pattern recognition system are of two kinds : 
-despite the apparent simplicity of the ideal representation of a given feature  the variation tolerated around the ideal curve is very large. 
-a given structure may be s p l i t into many substructures   i . e : a megaramp may include medium ramps  medium beds  etc.  
this last situation is natural for a geologist who adapts his scale of vision to the details relevant for his appreciation of the geological context. 
for these reasons  the following approach 	has been chosen; 	it consists of 1 steps: 
-a log polygonal approximation 
-a syntactic parsing of the approximating polygone logs approximation: 
the piecewise linear approximation of a log is interesting for the two following reasons: 
-the approximation can be matched with the scale of details which seems relevant 
 different scales are easily considered  
-each curve part is easily coded  two numbers for a segment  
we have restricted ourselves to piecewise approximation with no continuity requirements at the junction between two segments. it 

turns out that this limitation is actually beneficial. this is due to the fact that it is of primary importance to locate ruptures in the signal   discontinuities    which w i l l be emphasized if no continuity constraint is taken into account. 
such approximations are well suited to our problem because the degree of detail obtained in the approximating polygone is easily controlled. they are reached by using a split-and merge algorithm  1j. 
parsing of the logs: 
the curve decomposition into elementary segments is suited to a l i n g u i s t i c approach for the pattern recognition problem. in this type of processing  the waveshapes to be identified are viewed as a set of vectors concatenation which are analogous to the words of a language generated by a given grammar. the method is the following: 

fig 1. 	feature extraction on the density log 
	a. bonnet and c. dahan 	1 
-starting from the words corresponding to the desired curves shapes lead to define a grammar which w i l l generate exactly those words 
-constructing the corresponding parser  which w i l l decide  examining a vector arrangement  whether it is acceptable by the grammar. 
in this formalism  for instance  a decreasing ramp is represented by  the concatenation .of negative slope segments  the f i r s t slope segment being under a given threshold  and the jump between two successive segments  produced by the approximation  being under another threshold ; the parser that matches the feature against the grammar is implemented as a f i n i t e automaton. 
an example of performances of the overall procedure -polygonal approximation and syntactic parsing - is i l l u s t r a t e d in figure 
external data 
the term  external data  w i l l refer to a l l information which does not come from wire-line measurements. some are not always available for example cutting descriptions or paleontological data. others are always known  or can be inferred  such as the location of the well bearing very useful information about the global l i t h o l o g i c type usually encountered in a given area  e.g platform-carbonates in the middle-east . usually  age of formations  stratigraphical knowledge  is partly known from the geographical information. 
external knowledge is of 1 types outlined below. it either consists of taxonomies enabling accers to general rules from specific data or of inferences triggered as information is entered  if the age of the formation is  cambrian  then the rocks are very old  older than 1 millions of years  suggesting a high probability of very compacted rocks  i.e no gypsum  e t c .   . the 1 kinds are: 
 geography  geologic provinces  basins  fields  
tectonic a c t i v i t i e s 	 folds  faulting  
stratigraphy  geological eras  epochs  paleontology  fossiles  
mineralogy  calcite  clay  quartz  petrography  limestone  shale  sand  
sedimentology 	 reef  t i d a l channel  
petrophysics 	 porosity  permeability  
an example of rule combining geography and stratigraphy information is shown here:
