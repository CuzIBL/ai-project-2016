 
the background to t h i s work is the simulation of a planner who operates in a dynamic environment  by recognising the plans of others and predicting future events. the domain is that of a driver who must negotiate a route  obeying t r a f f i c r e g u l a t i o n s   and taking account of and avoiding c o l l i s i o n s with other vehicles- the world of the driver is represented by a changing world model; the channel of communication between planner and t h i s world model are actions from planner   d r i v e r ' s mind  to world  and perceptions from world to planner. simulating a dynamic world model has been an important aspect of t h i s work  and it is the implementation of t h i s which is discussed below. some new techniques of simulating physical processes have been developed. 
i 	scenario 
the a c t i v i t i e s of the driver are modelled by a planning system  autodrive  w r i t t e n in prolog. the simulation of planning is for a single d r i v e r ; however  autodrive can be consulted for any number of d r i v e r s   so in effect it is a planning system for m u l t i p l e agents. the planner takes into account other drivers in the domain when constructing plans  as well as road signs  t r a f f i c s i g n a l s   lane markings  e t c .   as these apply. for such purposes the d r i v i n g domain is well-defined  confined to behaviour which occurs on the road and independent of the actors taking part - i . e . t h e i r p e r s o n a l i t i e s   . this owes much to it being a r e l a t i v e l y e x p l i c i t l y rule-bound domain  with ' r i g h t s of way' specifying legal sequences of movements between a c t o r s   and t r a f f i c laws governing  for instance  when we are permitted to overtake. 
the aim of the planner is to construct a sequence of actions which enable the driver to reach a d e s t i n a t i o n   following a specified route. the d r i v e r ' s movements  actions  are communicated to the world simulator as changes in location over a 
series of points in time. for instance: 

this represents a green car t r a v e l l i n g north along the lewes road   b r i g h t o n !     one half metre from the kerb  at a rate of 1 metres per unit of time. 
the planning system achieves i t s goal - the d r i v e r reaching his d e s t i n a t i o n - by p l o t t i n g out in t h i s way the series of moves the driver takes. these moves must  of course  be legal and not result in c o l l i s i o n s with other cars or the v i o l a t i o n of t r a f f i c regulations. 
the simulated world of the driver is composed of roads whose width is divided into one or more lanes  which in places are marked  for example  with give-way l i n e s   pedestrian crossings  and aouble yellow l i n e s . along the roadside are t r a f f i c signals and various signs  e.g. school ahead  no-entry  no right t u r n . occasionally there are crossroads  roundabouts  side-turnings and t - j u n c t i o n s . the world is also populated with other vehicles moving f r e e l y about  and pedestrians  on crossings o n l y !   . these objects are selected as those most d i r e c t l y relevant to the task of d r i v i n g . 
at each instant of t i m e   the world simulator  also w r i t t e n in prolog provides the driver with information about the world appropriate to his location and the d i r e c t i o n his car is facing in rather like a snapshot of the world. for instance: 

this data is expressed in r e l a t i o n to the observer  green c a r     i . e . there are double yellow lines 1 metres ahead of the d r i v e r ; a single l e f t lane  1 metres wide  in the d r i v e r ' s d i r e c t i o n and in the opposite d i r e c t i o n   divided by a broken white l i n e ; there are three junctions ahead: on the l e f t inverness road  from 1 to 1 metres; and on the r i g h t aberdeen road  1 to 1 metres from the d r i v e r ; and edinburgh road  1 to 1 metres away.

ii modelling 	dynamic 	environments 
the term 'dynamic' world model is used here in contrast with an environment where no changes occur independently of the planner  only those which a single agent brings about himself. with an increase in number of agents who bring about changes in the environment  or the occurrence of independent events   e . g . r a i n     the environment is 'dynamic'. 
the simulated world model plays a v i t a l role in planning in such an environment. in the world of the single agent  actions may be r e f l e c t e d by 'instantaneous' additions and deletions of facts from the d e s c r i p t i o n of the w o r l d . however  in a dynamic environment  the planner cannot depend on knowledge of his own actions and the changes they bring about in the w o r l d   to successfully update his world model. even strips which planned in the world of a single agent  shakey the robot  needed planex  fikes  hart & n i l s s o n   1  to provide feedback on the success of i t s a c t i o n s . events and actions by other agents bring about changes in the w o r l d   rendering some plans i n e f f e c t i v e ; the planner therefore requires a constant source of up-to-date i n f o r m a t i o n   which an independent simulation of the world can p r o v i d e . 
relating the actions of a number of agents through the medium of time is a major problem in providing an accurate world d e s c r i p t i o n or simulation of the environment. the representation of time becomes a  /ery important issue. work in t h i s area  however. is not advanced. proposed systems f a l l into two categories:  a  updating through predicted s i g n i f i c a n t events;  b  updating incrementally through some p r e - s p e c i f i e d u n i t of time. hendrix  1  and b i r t w h i s t l e et al  1  use the f i r s t approach  while aut1dr1ve uses an a l t e r n a t i v e approach  s i m i l a r to wesson  1  based on the second. 
the u n i t i s a t i o n of time in the world s i m u l a t i o n   and thus the output of t i m e - r e l a t e d observational d a t a   is fundatmental to the planning process. for from over a series of t i m e - r e l a t e d observations  a v e h i c l e ' s speed and d i r e c t i o n   and t h e i r rate of change  can be deduced. from these observations the planning system derives  through hypothesis  both another agent's i n t e n t i o n   and a p r o j e c t i o n of his movement or actions in achieving t h i s g o a l . this c o n s t i t u t e s the planning system's  plan lookahead  model on which it may base future a c t i o n s . 
i l l description 1f  the  simulation system 
the data for representing the d r i v i n g environment is obtained from map information and observations of real roads. this forms a database of descriptions of task s p e c i f i c road elements  such as road markings  s i g n s   e t c . a d r i v e r is capable of covering quite a large distance in a short space of time  therefore the data which is p o t e n t i a l l y a v a i l a b l e is divided into manageable ' c h u n k s ' . to e f f e c t t h i s   road and j u n c t i o n areas are divided into 'segments' and treated as separate packages of data; where only several segments at a time c o n s t i t u t e the world model of the d r i v e r . the descriptions of objects are linked to the segment in which they appear  
s t a t i n g t h e i r precise 	location w i t h i n 	i t . 
the location of the d r i v e r is passed to the world simulator. the data item associated with the car - i t s 'car d e s c r i p t o r ' - informs the simulator of which segment the d r i v e r is i n   i t s p o s i t i o n w i t h i n that segment  i t s distance from the kerb  and the d i r e c t i o n in which it is t r a v e l l i n g . 
for each segment there is a 'segment c o n t r o l l e r ' whose takes a v e h i c l e ' s location and decides whether it is close enough to receive information about that segment. the segment c o n t r o l l e r plays the part of intermediary  and so does not i t s e l f obtain the data for the d r i v e r . instead  the segment c o n t r o l l e r in e f f e c t ' p l o t s ' the location of the d r i v e r by informing each item in i t s segment of that l o c a t i o n ; each item then 'shouts out' when it thinks it can 'see' the vehicle  and therefore the d r i v e r can see i t !   . thus  although the simulated world model represents a dynamic environment  i t i s i t s e l f s t a t i c   where vehicles are 'moving o b j e c t s ' w i t h i n that w o r l d   whose locations are p l o t t e d for each snapshot of t i m e . 
each car w i t h i n the d r i v i n g environment is also an observable o b j e c t ; t h e r e f o r e   some code is created for the d r i v e r   to enable it to 'shout out1 about i t s e l f   as other objects do. the lane p o s i t i o n of the car is made a v a i l a b l e by the same mechanism. 

the program incorporating these techniques so far described is implemented and running in prolog. extensions are proposed: the simulator w i l l ensure that a l l events taking place operate w i t h i n the physical constraints imposed by the environment. thus although the planner intends to be in a certain location at a p a r t i c u l a r point in t i m e   the world simulator i n t e r p r e t s actions in accordance with such c o n s t r a i n t s . 
creating the car as an i d e n t i f i a b l e object also proviaes a ' v e h i c l e ' for the feedback mechanism to the d r i v e r on his own p o s i t i o n   i . e .  you are here . . .       in accordance with t h i s   allowing the planner to maintain an accurate representation of the world. for instance  a car may pick up speed going down h i l l ; the driver is able to perceive t h i s via the feedback he receives. 
s i m i l a r l y   dynamic world simlation also involves modelling i n t e r a c t i o n s between actions and events and the objects within that world. problems surround attempting to model accurately the sidee f f e c t s of events and actions by agents in a representation of the world. in e a r l i e r problem solving work   e . g . fikes  hart and n i l s s o n   1  it was r e l a t i v e l y easy to ascertain the side-
e f f e c t s of actions by a single agent when the world i t s e l f was unchanging. for instance  a 
change in location meant the agent was no longer in place a and was now in place b. one could also make inferences: for instance  if object x was also in place b  the agent was next to object x  e t c . 
a changing environment may affect our a b i l i t y to achieve our goals by no longer s a t i s f y i n g necessary p r e c o n d i t i o n s . a more subtle e f f e c t of a changing environment  however  is to allow actions to take place but change their r e s u l t i n g s i d e - e f f e c t s   i . e . what they actually achieve. for example  one may estimate that d r i v i n g at a c e r t a i n speed would enable one to brake w i t h i n a 
c e r t a i n distance; however  if whilst executing t h i s a c t i o n   some events took place - e . g . some o i l s p i l t onto the road  the effect of braking w i l l be d i f f e r e n t ; i . e . the car w i l l t r a v e l a lot f u r t h e r before coming to a h a l t . 
this method of simulation offers new scope for handling t h i s problem. the world simulator mediates the actions of agents  rather than allowing them to d i r e c t l y change the world model. consequently  the simulator is able to constrain those a c t i o n s ; for instance  the current v e l o c i t y of a vehicle w i l l determine the minimum distance it can possibly cover in a specified time  even at 
maximum d e c e l e r a t i o n . further  the world simulator is also in a p o s i t i o n to model i n d i r e c t s i d e - e f f e c t s of events in the world  which consequently r e f l e c t s on the q u a l i t y of information a v a i l a b l e to each d r i v e r . for instance  it is not part of the act of d r i v i n g down a road that a large l o r r y or bus is a c t u a l l y making any changes to what there is to see. however  it may well be the case that a s i d e e f f e c t of a small car being close behind a bus  means that objects it would otherwise be able to see are obscured. so although a l o r r y driver does

not himself effect any such changes in the w o r l d   these s i d e - e f f e c t s must be r e f l e c t e d in the q u a l i t y of information a v a i l a b l e to the d r i v e r of the car. 
from t h i s point of view  segmentation is a powerful idea. by monitoring a l l that goes on w i t h i n a fixed area or segment  segment c o n t r o l l e r s are in a p o s i t i o n to monitor for i n t e r a c t i o n s between agents  and between t h e i r actions and various states of the world. they are then able to model t h i s by exercising control over what information gets through to the planner. 
iv conclusion 
a world simulator for modelling a dynamic environment has been described. the method of simulation is based on the p r i n c i p l e that it is easier to operate with a fixed representation of part of the dynamic w o r l d   than with a representation whose defining c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s are also changing. 
some techniques of modelling physical processes have been developed under the general heading of segment c o n t r o l . because the process of simulation resides with i n d i v i d u a l objects over which the segment c o n t r o l l e r presides  monitoring for i n t e r a c t i o n s between agents and objects is localised and can be r e f l e c t e d in the output 
allowed by the segment 	c o n t r o l l e r . 
segment c o n t r o l l e r s could p o t e n t i a l l y be quite s o p h i s t i c a t e d   handling the e f f e c t s of conditions such as fog on the o u t p u t   e . g . a l l items at a distance greater than known v i s i b i l i t y are vetoed. hopefully  the performance of the planner would degrade g r a c e f u l l y with the diminishing q u a l i t y of information  just l i k e human planners   rather than merely grinding to a h a l t .
