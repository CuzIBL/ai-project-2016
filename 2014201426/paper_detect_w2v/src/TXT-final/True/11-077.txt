pruf-an acronym for possibilistic relational 
universal fuzzy-is a designation for a novel type of synthetic language which is intended to serve as a target language for the representation of 
meaning of expressions in a natural language. 
¡¡¡¡¡¡pruf is based on the premise that the uncertainty in the interpretation of a proposition in a natural language is possibilistic rather than proba b i l i s t i c in nature. this implies that a proposit i o n   p  of the form  x is f  where x is the name of an object and f is a fuzzy subset of a universe of discourse u  translates in pruf into an expression  p  which defines a procedure whose domain is the set of possibly fuzzy relations in a database. acting on these relations  p yields a possibility distribution  or a set of possibility distributions  which characterizes the information  i   p     conveyed by p. 
¡¡¡¡¡¡the concept of a possibility distribution is defined as follows  zadeh 1 . let x be a v a r i able taking values in u  and let f be a fuzzy subset of u which is characterized by a membership function u f : u-  1   with u f  u   u € u   representing the grade of membership of u in f. then the proposition  x is f  induces a possibility d i s t r i bution  tl   which is given by the possibility association equation

where near is a fuzzy relation which associates with each pair of cities   c i t y l   c i t y 1   the degree to which they are near one another; resides is a relation which is particularized by  a  assigning the value john to the attribute subject; and  b  assigning the possibility distribution c i t ylnear city1 ¡ö boston  to the attribute location  in which near city1 ¡ö boston  denotes a p a r t i c u l a r i zation of the relation near with city1 set equal to boston  and c i t y near city1 = boston  denotes i t s projection on the domain of the attribute c i t y l . typically  an expression in pruf contains names of relations  names of attributes  particularized poss i b i l i t y distributions which are associated with attributes  and labels of tests. in appearance  the simpler expressions in pruf resemble those of the query language square and may involve an a r b i trary number of levels of nesting. 
¡¡¡¡¡¡pruf has a variety of f a c i l i t i e s for modeling the logical organization of natural languages. among these are: attribute modification  truth qualification  probability qualification  possibili t y qualification  quantification  particularization and composition. i t s expressive power is considerably greater than that of semantic networks or f i r s t order predicate calculus  and by employing the concept of a possibility distribution pruf pro-
vides an effective framework for dealing with the imprecision of natural languages in a systematic fashion. 
¡¡¡¡¡¡the logic underlying pruf is a fuzzy logic  fl  in which the truth-values are l i n g u i s t i c   i . e .   are expressed as true  quite true  very true  more or less true  etc.   with the base logic  for fl being lukasiewicz1 s lalephi logic in which the t r u t h values are points in the unit interval  bellman & zadeh 1 . in addition to the use of linguistic truth-values  pruf allows the use of linguistic quantifiers  e.g.   many  few  several  most  almost a l l   etc.; linguistic probabilities expressed as l i k e l y   very likely  more or less l i k e l y   etc.; and linguistic possibilities expressed as possible  quite possible  s l i g h t l y possible  almost impossible  etc. 
¡¡¡¡¡¡pruf has only two basic rules of inference:  a  the projection rule  which asserts that from an n-ary possibility distribution it x-i x   one can infer by projection a marginal possibility d i s t r i bution ii xi1   . . .  xii.  where   i     .   .   i     is a subsequence of tne index sequence   l   . . .   n   ; and  b  that from i t   x i f . . .  xn  and i i   x i l t . . .  xijj one can infer the intersection of ii x1 ... xn  with the c y l i n drical extension of ii x i 1   ....xiu * * n combinat i o n   these two rules lead to the compositional rule of inference which includes the classical 
modus ponens as a special case.
