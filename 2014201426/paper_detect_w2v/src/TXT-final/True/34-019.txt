	1. 	introduction 
　　　the representation of knowledge is one of the most important problems of ai today. early approaches to ai attempted to s i m p l i f y the problems tackled by proposing syntactic solutions to inherently semantic problems  thus understating the importance of the representation of knowledge. the h i s t o r y of ai has taught us  however  that there are no shortcuts to the process of  understanding . this process can only be accomplished by a system that possesses knowledge about the topic it is expected to understand. moreover  the degree of understanding is proportional to the degree to which t h i s knowledge can be used for recognition and p r e d i c t i o n . the importance of the representat i o n of knowledge stems from these premises. 
　　　in t h i s paper we o u t l i n e a model of semantic representation that includes a semantic net work  and a context mechanism  and i l l u s t r a t e i t s use 
with several examples. 
　　　our semantic net is organized around the concept of a  scenario   i . e . a semantic u n i t that may encompass more than j u s t isolated propositions. this is in agreement w i t h current trends in t h i s area of research  minsky   1     schank   1     abelson   1   e t c .   * scenarios as well as more elementary semantic e n t i t i e s are organized on the semantic net along two axes we have called the sub and def axes. the sub axis has been used elsewhere  norman and rumelhart   1     martin i 1   and a form of the def axis has also been used in   1 l . 
　　　given a semantic net  we consider the problem of defining and using a context mechanism for referent determination   semantic  disambiguation and inference. the problem of i n t e g r a t i n g new information to the semantic net is also treated through a process we c a l l  graph f i t t i n g   and the r e l a t i o n s h i p of context and graph f i t t i n g is d i s cussed. f i n a l l y   a long example is presented to i l l u s t r a t e both the s u i t a b i l i t y of the representat i o n and the use of the context mechanism. 
　　　the knowledge we have represented and used for most of the examples is derived from the  educat i o n a l w o r l d     i . e . the world of students  courses and grades  applications to u n i v e r s i t i e s and decisions by u n i v e r s i t i e s regarding admission  e t c . we consider the educational world an example of an i n s t i t u t i o n a l world and regard further work on modelling p a r t i c u l a r i n s t i t u t i o n a l worlds q u i t e important since they subsume many s i t u a t i o n s which arise in d a i l y l i f e   e.g. business. with the exception of work by martin  and malhotra  1   we are not aware of other major e f f o r t s to represent and use knowledge that can be c l a s s i f i e d as i n s t i t u t i o n a l . 
　　　we must emphasize from the beginning that t h i s work has as goal the creation of   i n t e l l i g e n t   computer systems rather than cognitive simulation of humans. the work was carried out as part of the torus  toronto understanding system  project 
whose aim is to provide natural language f r o n t ends to  relational  data base management systems. a prototype version of torus has been implemented   mylopoulos et al   1     and uses a simpler version of the semantic memory described here. the universe of discourse for the prototype i s   again  the educational world. 
1. world modelling 
　　　by  world modelling  we mean here the process of representing the knowledge relevant to a t o p i c of discourse. in t h i s section we introduce the torus representation and give several examples of how knowledge about a domain of discourse can be represented. 
1 	the semantic network - basic building blocks 
　　　the semantic network is simply a l a b e l l e d 
　　　directed graph  where both edges and nodes may be l a b e l l e d . the labels of nodes w i l l only be used f o r reference purposes and w i l l usually be mnemonic names. the labels of edges  on the other hand  w i l l have a number of associated semantic propert i e s and inferences. 
it must be noted that our use of the term 
 semantic network  is d i f f e r e n t from that of q u i l l i a n   1     simmons   etc. however  we f e e l that the term captures the essence of the object it names and propose to continue to use i t . 
 we recognize three basic types of nodes: concepts  events and c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s   which are used to represent the ideas making up our universe. 
　　　concepts are the essential constants or parameters of our world and specify objects or abstractions. 	there is a loose connection between concepts and a subset of the class of nouns. 

1 

　　　events are used to represent the actions which can occur in the world that we are modelling. their representation ased on a case-grammar model  with which we assume the reader is f a m i l i a r   cases  or roles  w i l l be represented by casel a b e l l e d edges r a d i a t i n g outward from the event node and pointing to the nodes which f i l l the respective cases. for example  

represents an instance of the event  apply  with the agent case f i l l e d by  john  and the destination case f i l l e d by  department . 
　　　the following is the l i s t of the cases presently in use: agent  a   affected  aff    topic   t     instrument   i     r e s u l t   r     source  s   destination  d  and object  o . their names are intended to be approximately self-explanatory. 
　　　for a complete understanding of an event  a l l of i t s cases must be known. we w i l l not i n s i s t   however  t h i s always be done at the time the event is f i r s t presented for i n t e g r a t i o n with the semantic net and the context. many semantic cases which are omitted from the input are f i l l e d in by default and contextually i n f e r r e d cases when t h i s input is integrated i n t o the net. 
　　　the cases of an event can often be r e l a t e d to l i n g u i s t i c syntactic phenomena  e.g. prepositions  i n f l e c t i o n a l a f f i x e s   e t c .   of a corresponding verb and t h i s c o r r e l a t i o n can be very h e l p f u l in obtaining the mapping between actual sentences and t h e i r semantic representation. 
　　　a more important function of cases is to aid in inference and other l o g i c a l operations which must be performed when isolated events are put i n t o context. this is an important topic and w i l l be discussed in section 1. 
　　　characteristics are used to represent states and to modify concepts  events or other characteri s t i c s . for concepts  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s can be 
q u a l i t i e s   t r a i t s or properties which are inherent i n   or ascribed t o   the concept. for events  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s describe general properties which are less closely associated with the event than are cases and which have a more general  uniform meaning at a l l times  e.g. l o c a t i o n   time  duration  e t c .   . a c h a r a c t e r i s t i c may be considered to be a binary r e l a t i o n   mapping elements from i t s domain those nodes to which the c h a r a c t e r i s t i c may apply  to the range - those values which the c h a r a c t e r i s t i c 
may take. for example  sex maps animal i n t o the set containing male  female. graphically  the c h a r a c t e r i s t i c is represented as a node labelled by the name of the c h a r a c t e r i s t i c   with a  ch    characterize   edge pointing to an element of the domain and a  v    value   edge pointing to the corresponding value: 
c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of a person  although  if considered in more d e t a i l   it could be represented as the location of the dwelling which the person usually inhabits. in some circumstances such abbreviations are mappings from a cross-product domain to a range and we use a wrt  with-respect-to  edge to indicate the second argument. for example  grade characterizes students with respect to course  producing a grade.value: 

　　　in addition to these types of e n t i t i e s   we w i l l sometimes use mathematical predicates such as member  difference  etc. 
　　　the nodes that constitute the semantic net w i l l be divided i n t o two classes: one  r e l a t i n g to generic concepts  events and c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s   describes the possible or allowable state of a f f a i r s in our domain of discourse. this class we s h a l l informally c a l l the   u p s t a i r s   of the semant i c network in contrast to the second class  t ' s  downstairs   where we keep the i n s t a n t i a t i o n s and p a r t i c u l a r occurences of various ideas.  upstairs  nodes w i l l have t h e i r names given in c a p i t a l l e t t e r s   whereas nodes  downstairs  w i l l be in lower-case. 

　　　the apparatus described in the previous section is s u f f i c i e n t for the representation of most isolated phenomena  but we need the a b i l i t y to construct larger units of knowledge which w i l l help in inference  referent determination  p r e d i c t i o n   etc. such structures have been proposed in various forms by many others  including minsky's frames   1     schank's s c r i p t s   1     riesbeck's story patterns   1     e t c . we c a l l our version of such structures scenarios. 
　　　a scenario is a c o l l e c t i o n of events  charact e r i s t i c s and mathematical predicates related through t h e i r associated edges and the concepts f i l l i n g t h e i r cases  or through temporal and/or causal connectives  such as  before     a f t e r      same.time     w h i l e      prerequisite  and   e f f e c t   . 


        true  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s are usually natural a t t r i b u t e s of concepts  but characteristics can also be used as abbreviations of more complicated s i t u a t i o n s   where we want to omit unnecessary d e t a i l . thus address may be thought of as a 
　　　one can regard a scenario as a pattern which  when matched by a s t r u c t u r e   enables the system to make inferences and predictions. consider  for example  the notion of  a person's current address   which may be represented as 

1 
we can now organize   p a r t i a l l y order  the 

here    i t   stands f o r the numerical predicate  less than*  and  bvar  stands for a bound variable whose value we do not know. clearly t h i s is a very simple scenario since it does not allow any inferences or any   n o n - t r i v i a l   p r e d i c t i o n s . 
　　　consider now a scenario for recommending a person to an organization by w r i t i n g a l e t t e r : 

　　　this scenario describes a recommendation action in terms of write and transfer actions  the f i r s t being the p r e r e q u i s i t e of the second. the r e l a t i o n s h i p between the cases of the two actions is also defined. note that the recommending person is both the agent of write and the agent-source of transfer. the names of the nodes here indicate the types of i n s t a n t i a t i o n s that can f i l l the cases of t h i s scenario. the   d i f f e r   edge specifies that a 
　　　person cannot recommend himself. 
　　　the reader may wonder how t h i s scenario is related to recommend. we w i l l discuss o v e r a l l organization of the semantic net in the next sect i o n and we only wish to mention here that t h i s scenario may be thought of as an abstract procedure defining recommend. there may be other scenarios which define write and transfer in terms of other  more p r i m i t i v e   events. 
1 	semantic net organization 
　　　so f a r we have discussed the e n t i t i e s that serve as b u i l d i n g blocks f o r our representation. in t h i s section we describe how they are put together to form the semantic net. this organizat i o n w i l l be defined in terms of  axes  or 
concepts occuring in our domain of discourse i n t o a hierarchy  representable by i t s hasse diagram. it is important to note t h a t  semantic  properties of concepts are i n h e r i t e d along the sub a x i s . thus  for example  since students are persons and 
persons are physical.objects  students may have a 
weight associated w i t h them. this property of the sub axis provides us w i t h a very important memorysaving device. 
　　　scenarios are also organized on the sub a x i s . consider the generic c h a r a c t e r i s t i c for address. 
legal.person  address.value 
legal.person stands f o r a person or an organization  anything you can sue .. .   . below it on the sub axis we can place scenarios for o f f i c e address and home address  for persons only: 

　　　thus a person's o f f i c e address  defined by the node marked with *  is the location value  address values are also location values in t h i s represent a t i o n   of the office used by the person. the representation of use and office is rather superf i c i a l   but l e g a l   and w i l l do to drive the p o i n t across. 
　　　we could now f i t the current address below the o f f i c e address scenario  in order to define the notion of  current o f f i c e address  

1 


the l e f t superscript 1's indicate the corres-
	pondence of nodes between the l a s t two figures. 	there need not be j u s t a single  def  or 
	note that the address node marked with * does not 	  f e d   edge leaving an event being defined. 	there 
	need a  ch  or  v  edge  since these are i n h e r i t e d 	can be several defining scenarios for the same 
	from i t s supernode. 	event and many possible entry points 	  def  edges  
	and e x i t points 	  fed  edges . 	moreover  an event 
	before we proceed to discuss other axes used 	or c h a r a c t e r i s t i c may be defined r e c u r s i v e l y . 
	to organize the semantic net  	it is worthwhile to 
	mention a few things about the top of the sub axis  	the recommend event of the previous diagram 
	every node on the semantic net f i t s below the node 	may be i t s e l f p a r t of an apply-to-an-organization 
	object  	scenario  which can have as subscenario apply-to-a 
- u n i v e r s i t y . this  in t u r n   may be part of a  going to college  scenario  which in turn may be part of a   g e t t i n g an education  scenario. 
scenarios are then r e l a t e d to each other along the def and sub axis as follows: 
　　　at one end of the def axis one would f i n d 
　　　very general scenarios and plans. 
t i o n   world  these might involve   g e t t i n g an 
education    choosing a vocation   e t c . a c t i v i t i e s which i n t e r a c t with a huge number of 
       it is i n t e r e s t i n g to note that with such scenarios being present at the top of the sub a x i s   only structures which f a i l to s a t i s f y the syntactic rules of the semantic net w i l l be rejected 	  i . e . w i l l match no scenario on the net . 	thus the 
structure 

w i l l match at least at the most general characteri s t i c scenario given e a r l i e r   provided that  color  can be c l a s s i f i e d as a c h a r a c t e r i s t i c and 1kg as a c h a r a c t e r i s t i c value. 	this feature of the semantic net enables us to introduce scenarios that w i l l account for 	 semantically  	unusual structures. these scenarios may cause inferences such as  i don't 	understand what he's t a l k i n g about   e t c .   and r e s u l t in corresponding actions on the part of the system  question the user  e t c .   . 
1.1 	the def axis 
　　　we have already defined recommend  through a l e t t e r   in terms of a scenario. we w i l l denote 
the r e l a t i o n s h i p between recommend and i t s cases  on one hand  and the recommend scenario  on the other hand  by using  def  and   f e d   - l a b e l l e d edges: other general scenarios which would lead o f f i n t o diverse areas. a domain of discourse  f o r which our representation might be adequate  would attempt to minimize i t s dependence upon t h i s end of the d e f i n i t i o n a l a x i s . one of the underlying assumptions of any attempt to model small  closed domains of discourse is that t h i s minimization can 
be done. 
　　　at the other end of the def a x i s   one would f i n d   p r i m i t i v e s   - those e n t i t i e s which we 
choose not to represent and thus take as   g i v e n     implying that they are  somehow  understood. unlike schank  we believe that the p r i m i t i v e s t h a t would be incorporated i n t o a net should be dependent upon the domain of discourse as w e l l as 
convenience. 
　　　f i n a l l y   we should mention that another edge which defines an axis is the   p a r t   edge 	 a grade 
is a  part  of a transcript  which is a   p a r t   of an application  a department is a  part  of a university  e t c .   . 
1 	procedural knowledge 
　　　representing knowledge on the semantic net has the advantage that t h i s information can be examined and reasoned about by the system. on the other hand  the representation is expensive. 1 

and for any universe of discourse  there w i l l always be ' p e r i p h e r a l ' knowledge for which general reasoning may not be necessary- we represent such knowledge in terms of functions which we associate to corresponding nodes of the semantic net. 
　　　some of these functions we w i l l c a l l recognition functions because t h e i r job is to use syntactic and semantic information in order to recognize instances of a class  e.g. address.value . mapping functions w i l l be useful for mapping structures from one level of the representation to another. for example  mapping functions may be used to replace portions of the d e f i n i t i o n a l axis if it is decided that other l e v e l s   more surface or deeper ones  are not of i n t e r e s t . another type of function is a d e f i n i t i o n a l function/ which is used to define procedures for performing p a r t i c u l a r actions  evaluate an a p p l i c a t i o n   move a block  e t c .   . 
       it is important to stress that knowledge can be represented  in general  in e i t h e r procedural or declarative form and which form is selected is s t r i c t l y an issue of trading cost for 'understanding power'. 
　　　the same issue is p a r t l y c o n t r o l l i n g another question: what ' p r i m i t i v e s ' do we use in our representation  some p r i m i t i v e s are important 
because of the inferences they generate or require. for example  in modelling the educational or any i n s t i t u t i o n a l world  the event of assigning values to certain characteristics is treated as a p r i m i t i v e because it implies that the agent of the action is s o c i a l l y responsible for the act and has the authority to carry it out  e.g. only a professor is allowed to assign grades to a student . other ' p r i m i t i v e s ' are nothing more than a r b i t r a r y undefined terms  e.g. write   which are not important to the p a r t i c u l a r domain of discourse for which t h i s representation is geared. s i m i l a r l y   some events w i l l be described by scenarios in terms of other events on the semantic net  e.g. apply in section 1.1  while others are assumed to have an external d e f i n i n g scenario which is known to e x i s t but is not e x p l i c i t l y stored  e.g.  completing an application form  . 
1. context and i t s uses 
　　　in t h i s s e c t i o n   we describe how context can be organized so that immediate inferences are contextually appropriate and vice versa. the purpose of the current context f a c i l i t y is to maintain information relevant to the topic at hand. this information is derived from expectations and inferences and uses scenarios. the section below describes the process of generating a context  using it for i n t e g r a t i n g input and determining sentential referents. we also discuss finding the context relevant to an input by a process called  graph f i t t i n g   . f i n a l l y   a 
　　　detailed example is presented  serving to cover many of the s a l i e n t features in the preceding discussion. 
1 	generation of context 
　　　our study of context here is centered around i n f e r e n t i a l l y generating the  foreground   chafe   1   for a given sentence. when regarding t h i s problem from a network point of view  one sees that it is necessary to discuss the various inferences that can be made from edges in the net  cases  *'sub    part   and scenarios  including causal and temporal connectives . many of the inferences resemble those discussed in rieger . since we are using a d i f f e r e n t representation than h i s   we have found it necessary to restate those inferences in our terminology. in a d d i t i o n   the use of scenarios w i t h i n the net w i l l   hopefully  guide the i n f e r e n t i a l generation of context to p o t e n t i a l l y relevant information  as opposed to brute  expansion  as done by rieger. 
　　　the presence of a network e n t i t y in the context represents the system's expectation that t h i s item is or w i l l be relevant to the current dialogue. when new information  which has been predicted  enters the dialogue  i t s relevance can be explained by the  generation path  taken to create the expectation. we give an example of 
part of the context generation process below. 
	consider the 	  p a r t i a l   	scenario 
and the sentences 
 john applied yesterday. 	the grades were good.  
　　　we can generate part of the context of apply by i n t e r p r e t i n g the   r e s u l t   case and the  part  edge as described below. when apply occurs  it produces an application which enters the context. when we bring application i n   we bring w i t h i t   i t s constituent   p a r t   s . thus grade and transcript are available for discussion without a previous reference  as is indicated by the d e f i n i t e s p e c i f i c a t i o n in the above example. inferences are h e u r i s t i c a l l y assigned strengths which are used to l i m i t the extent of t h e i r propagation  cf. rieger  1  . 
　　　below we l i s t a few edge labels and discuss how context growth is affected by each. 

　　　a is an event  scenario  and b is a concept. this edge corresponds to the output of some process  scenario . thus  when a is i n s t a n t i a t e d   an instance of b should be created and added to the context. the propagation value of this edge  in both d i r e c t i o n s   is h i g h   as can be seen from the apply example above. inferences from   r e s u l t   can occur when b is a concept which is e i t h e r an  instrument  or  object  used by some other event c  more generally  an input to c . this produces a prerequisite ordering of events. namely  a must be executed before c since a's output is input to c. this information may be redundantly discovered from the  prerequisite  edge  but the   r e s u l t input  inference is stronger since it explains why the producer is prerequisite to the consumer. 

　　　when a is i n s t a n t i a t e d   there is a strong inference that b w i l l be relevant and thus it should be i n s t a n t i a t e d and placed in the context. 

1 

this expectation enables the system to predict part of a scenario from a piece of i t . the one step prediction corresponds sieger's r e s u l t a t i v e class. 
　　　s i m i l a r l y   when b is i n s t a n t i a t e d   especially when it is w i t h i n a well specified scenario  the presumption that a exists  and caused b  is strong. this class of inferences is similar to rieger's causative class. 
　　　a p a r t i c u l a r l y important inference to be made from the   e f f e c t   edge is that of social o b l i g a t i o n . 
for example  

　　　if the   e f f e c t   edge connects two events with d i f f e r e n t agents  	then the agent 	 supplier  of the caused event 	 supply  	is under social o b l i g a t i o n to perform the event or scenario. 	we feel this usage of   e f f e c t   to be very important to i n s t i t u t i o n a l scenarios and it may be a distinguishing feature of these scenarios from say  physical or 
mental scenarios. 

　　　b could be a c h a r a c t e r i s t i c or an event. if a is i n s t a n t i a t e d   we can confidently assert b i n t o the context since a could not have happened unless b were s a t i s f i e d  rieger's  enabling  class . if b e x i s t s   we can p r e d i c t that a should be part of the context. 
　　　a s i m i l a r analysis can be carried out for other edge labels such as   p a r t      agent     c h a r a c t e r i s t i c       o b j e c t     e t c . 	with a l l edges  propagation in the reverse d i r e c t i o n from the target node is dependent upon the number of i d e n t i c a l l y l a b e l l e d edges entering that node. 
　　　we have not yet stated where these predictions should be placed with respect to the rest of the net. we view the context as a shadow data base  one which can be seen if looked for but ignored when necessary. 
1 	graph f i t t i n g 
　　　a part of the procedure for integrating new input to the semantic network is done by the graph f i t t i n g algorithm. 	this section discusses both the algorithm and i t s r e l a t i o n to context. 
　　　in attempting to integrate t h i s to the semant i c net  we could f i t  address  below the generic address node   time  below the generic time node  e t c . however  since we wish to isolate the most s p e c i f i c information in the net relevant to a given input  it is advantageous to f i t the above example below the  current o f f i c e address  scenario. thus  even though  address  may o r i g i n a l l y match the generic address node  the graph f i t t i n g algorithm w i l l push it down to more specific scenarios u n t i l t h i s is no longer possible. this is the essence of graph f i t t i n g . 
suppose now that the input sentence had been 
 john smith's address is 1 st. george s t .   toronto   where it is no longer specified whether we are t a l k i n g about a home or o f f i c e address. there are three choices a v a i l a b l e :  i  f i t the information below a l l scenarios we can  thus t r e a t i n g  1 st. george s t .   toronto  both as an o f f i c e and home address    i i   f i t the new informat i o n below the f i r s t scenario found or   i i i   r e a l i z e the ambiguity  but not f i t t i n g the input graph to either scenario  and asking for c l a r i f i c a t i o n . we w i l l adopt strategy   i i i     although there is no overwhelming evidence either f o r it or the others. 
　　　in general  graph f i t t i n g is carried out by considering a candidate scenario  c a l l it s  and a structure s  and by t r y i n g to match every event or c h a r a c t e r i s t i c in s to a corresponding e n t i t y in s. once it has been decided that s matches s  s is added to the 'matched-scenario' l i s t . the subscenarios of s are considered next and each is matched against s. a l l of these  which successf u l l y match against s  then replace s on the 
matched-scenario l i s t . when t h i s step no longer produces any changes  a search is c a r r i e d out  downstairs   below every scenario on the matchedscenario l i s t   to see if   p a r t i a l   i n s t a n t i a t i o n s of s can be found. depending on the r e s u l t of t h i s search  either  a p o r t i o n of  s is i d e n t i f i e d with already e x i s t i n g nodes or new ones are created and placed below a l l scenarios on the l i s t . 
　　　the f i r s t scenarios to be considered for matching against s depend on the context. thus  if send-a-recommendation-letter is on the shadow data base and a  send  event appears as part of s  graph f i t t i n g w i l l f i r s t t r y the send which is part of the context rather than the generic node send. if t h i s match is successful  everything proceeds as described before. if not  the system has been ' s u r p r i s e d ' but  rather than giving up  it t r i e s to f i n d scenarios higher up on the net  which w i l l match s. as explained in section 1 . 1 . 1   t h i s search w i l l always be successful because of the way the top of the sub axis is organized. of course  once a p o s i t i o n for s has been found  a  possibly new  context is generated. 
thus graph f i t t i n g and context are i n t i m a t e l y 

　　　consider the sentence  john smith's o f f i c e address is 1 st. george s t .   toronto   which is mapped in a straightforward manner i n t o 

r e l a t e d   although they have d i f f e r e n t functions. 
　　　g r a p h - f i t t i n g can be h e l p f u l in i d e n t i f y i n g the head nouns modified by r e s t r i c t i v e r e l a t i v e 
　　　clauses. thus  for  the woman who supervises john suports b i l l     the algorithm would f i r s t f i t the r e l a t i v e clause for the given information  locate the appropriate woman  and proceed to f i t the main clause. in the process  the algorithm would ensure that the woman in question is a professor. 
1 	an example 	scenario d -  process-an-application         we now give an example to i l l u s t r a t e the mechanisms described e a r l i e r . the example consists of four sentences that are consecutively presented to the system and must be  understood . the sentences are: 
 1   john applied to the u n i v e r s i t y of 
toronto  
 1   he sent his a p p l i c a t i o n l a s t friday  
 1   professor jones received it on monday  
 1   john received his acceptance on thursday  
1.1 	scenarios of the educational world 
       the scenarios to be used for the analysis of the f i v e sentences w i l l now be described. 
scenario a -  enter-a-university  
       in order to enter a u n i v e r s i t y one must apply f o r admission i n t o one of the programs o f f e r e d by the u n i v e r s i t y . once t h i s is done  the u n i v e r s i t y processes the a p p l i c a t i o n and i f i t finds i t accept a b l e   the applicant i s e l i g i b l e t o r e g i s t e r f o r the program that he applied f o r . 

　　　t h i s s c e n a r i o i n c l u d e s a more g e n e r i c process event where the   r e s u l t   may be  acceptance  or   r e j e c t i o n     	and a subevent where t h e   r e s u l t   case i s o n l y   a c c e p t a n c e   . 	t h i s r e p r e s e n t a t i o n accounts 	f o r the 	c o n d i t i o n a l 	i n 	the 	s c e n a r i o 	  i f t h e u n i v e r s i t y accepts h i m   he can r e g i s t e r   . 

1 . 1 . 1 	a n a l y z i n g the sentences 
       it w i l l be assumed t h a t the system does expect t h e t o p i c of d i s c o u r s e to be about s t u d e n t s   a p p l i c a t i o n s t o u n i v e r s i t i e s e t c .   s o t h e s c e n a r i o a w i l l become immediately r e l e v a n t when t h e f i r s t sentence i s presented f o r a n a l y s i s . 
sentence 1 :  john a p p l i e d t o the u n i v e r s i t y o f t o r o n t o   
       the sentence is f i t t e d below t h e apply event of s c e n a r i o a. the r e l e v a n c e of s c e n a r i o a causes a number of nodes to be added to t h e shadow d a t a base  see s e c t i o n 1 . 1   . 

scenario b -  apply~to-a-university  
　　　in order for a person to apply to a university  with the result being an application  he must prepare the application and have it transferred to the university. 

       nodes i n s m a l l 	l e t t e r s 	i n d i c a t e here 	i n s t a n t i a t e d o b j e c t s o f t h e c o n t e x t   	whereas 	those 	i n c a p i t a l 	l e t t e r s 	i n d i c a t e o b j e c t s 	t h a t appear 	t o b e r e l e v a n t b u t have not been 	i n s t a n t i a t e d y e t . 
sentence 1 : 	 he s e n t t h e a p p l i c a t i o n 	l a s t f r i d a y   
       we w i l l i g n o r e t h e temporal component of t h e meaning o f t h i s sentence. 
       f i r s t o f a l l   t h e r e are two problems o f r e f e r e n c e t h a t must be r e s o l v e d h e r e .  he  can be a s s o c i a t e d w i t h  john  e a s i l y enough s i n c e t h e l a t t e r i s the only c a n d i d a t e which meets the s e l e c t i o n a l r e s t r i c t i o n s f o r   h e   .  the a p p l i c a t i o n   is r e s o l v e d by u s i n g t h e shadow d a t a base g e n e r a t e d so f a r . 
       it must now be d e t e r m i n e d where  send an a p p l i c a t i o n   f i t s and how i t i s r e l a t e d t o t h e 
       c u r r e n t c o n t e x t . since no send appears on s c e n a r i o a  a search is c a r r i e d o u t above and 
below apply on the def a x i s   to locate an occurence of send which is relevant to the current context. this search succeeds wo levels below apply 

and we can therefore conclude that scenarios b and c are also relevant at t h i s point. the expanded shadow data base includes the nodes shown e a r l i e r plus : 

note t h a t   a p p l i c a t i o n   has now been i n s t a n t i a t e d along w i t h   c r e a t e     which i s a p r e r e q u i s i t e f o r transfer  and t h e r e f o r e   s e n d   . 
sentence 	1: 	  p r o f e s s o r 	jones 	r e c e i v e d i t 	o n monday  
       there is a receive node t h a t is p a r t of t h e c o n t e x t and i t b i n d s   i t   t o   a p p l i c a n t     a s i t s h o u l d . u n f o r t u n a t e l y   i t has a s   s o u r c e   t h e 
         u n i v e r s i t y o f t o r o n t o     whereas the source o f the incoming   r e c e i v e   i s   p r o f e s s o r j o n e s   . t o r e s o l v e t h i s p r o b l e m   we must a c e r t a i n t h a t   p r o f e s s o r j o n e s   is employed by the u n i v e r s i t y   has the a u t h o r i t y t o review a p p l i c a t i o n s and i s i n the r i g h t department. we assume t h a t these checks can be c a r r i e d o u t and they succeed  so t h a t the receive node of the shadow d a t a base can be i n s t a n t i a t e d . 

note 	t h a t 	  t r a n s f e r   	has 	a l s o been 	i n s t a n t i a t e d s i n c e 	i t s s c e n a r i o has been i n s t a n t i a t e d comp l e t e l y . 	the event   a s s i g n . a u t h o r i t y   	is used as a s i m p l e - m i n d e d r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of the 	f a c t 	t h a t p r o f e s s o r jones has 	the a u t h o r i t y to handle 	 and process  	a p p l i c a t i o n s . 
sentence 	1: 	 john r e c e i v e d h i s acceptance on thursday  
　　　again  ignoring the temporal modifier  the structure that we s t a r t with and which must be integrated to the semantic net is 

 acceptance  is an i n s t a n t i a t i o n of a node already on the shadow data base and t h i s is used to guide the search that w i l l explain  receive  above and below process. 

however  the  object  case of receive is predicted to be letter  not  acceptance . in attempting to explain t h i s c o n t r a d i c t i o n   we note that both e n t i t i e s are used in cases of write  which is a candidate for the shadow data base  letter being the   r e s u l t   and  acceptance  being the   t o p i c   of write. thus  acceptance  is the message while letter is the medium  and these terms are often used interchangeably   i received  the l e t t e r with  the message.    i understood {the contents of  the book. . we can formalize t h i s r u l e by saying that e n t i t i e s which serve as   t o p i c   and   r e s u l t   of an event involving transmission of a message may appear interchangeably in a surface s t r u c t u r e . this enables the system to accept the receive it has found and to i n s t a n t i a t e process  evaluate  communicate  write  transfer  send and receive in the shadow data base because of the   f e d   and  prereq  edges that connect them to the i n s t a n t i a t e d receive. 
　　　although not shown  the r e s u l t i n g shadow data base is f a i r l y large by now and includes several items which were i n f e r r e d and/or predicted because of the scenarios that are available to the system. 
	1. 	concluding remarks 
　　　we have extended standard semantic network methodology to include scenarios in order to deal with problems of inference and context. along with the declarative knowledge stored on a semantic net  we have sketched classes of procedural knowledge that can be used to represent peripheral knowledge  to map from one level of the representat i o n to another  and to execute imperatives where t r a c i n g through scenarios would be too expensive. like other workers proposing s i m i l a r s t r u c t u r e s   we consider scenarios as organized chunks of knowledge which model commonplace occurences in our educational world. 
       it is apparent that more i n s t i t u t i o n a l worlds w i l l have to be modelled before we can detect commonalities and can make d e f i n i t i v e statements on the kinds of p r i m i t i v e s needed to model such worlds. another very important problem we have not discussed at a l l in this paper is that of switching topics. any reasonable language understanding system must have a model  scenario   of how  when and why the topic under discussion switches. moreover  additional work is needed to determine the amount of scenario information which must be brought i n t o a context when an event in the net is i n s t a n t i a t e d . in addition to these problems  we have not dealt with exceptions to scenarios  i . e .   what happens when things don't occur as they are supposed t o . 
　　　among a l l these and other open problems we did not mention above  we consider the problem of modelling several i n s t i t u t i o n a l worlds and that of modelling the conversation process  in addition to knowledge about which to converse  of paramount 

importance. we intend to work on these problems in the f u t u r e .
