i n t e r a c t i n g goals 
　　　a problem is given to a means-end analysis based problem solver  such as strips  fikes & n i l s son  1  and the planning part of the hacker 
 sussman  1  system  as a conjunction of goals 
	e.g. 	 g1 	& g1  
which must be true for the problem to be solved. since the individual goals are solved sequentially  they must  once achieved  hold together for a period of time. the time for which an achieved goal 
must remain true w i l l be called the goal's 	  h o l d i w i l l i l l u s t r a t e this as in f i g u r e 
　　　the horizontal dimension of this  holding period  diagram represents time during which actions w i l l be applied in a f i n a l plan to achieve the given goals. approach should be interpreted as: if c1 not true achieve it using some operator sequence  then do likewise for g1. 
　　　strips assumes  in the absence of other i n formation  that it can achieve the individual goals by relevant plan sequences  say  in the o r d er in which the goals are given  sussman c a l l s t h i s a linear assumption . thus  as shown in figure 1  it assumes gl can be solved f i r s t by some relevant plan sequence and then that g1 can be solved by a plan sequence following on from the f i r s t . if strips can f i n d no way to achieve the goals in the order given  it is capable of reversing the order it has attempted to achieve goals  which were i n i t i a l l y not true  at the f a i l u r e level  e.g. at the top level gl and g1 could be reversed to give an expected holding period diagram as in figure 1 . 
       strips further assumes that for the goals not already true at the time required  the precondit i o n s   which are required to be true for some operator to be applied to achieve the goal  can a l l be made true immediately before the time the goal is required to be t r u e . again  reversals amongst these preconditions can be made on f a i l u r e backup. thus  if the preconditions for some operator to achieve a goal g. are g.  and gi1  then strips 
i n i t i a l l y assumes an approach as in f i g u r e 1 can 
be taken. 
note that the holding period diagram represents the goals to be worked upon for some chosen operator sequence. there is r e a l l y a 1rd dimension to the diagram representing d i f f e r e n t choices of 
operators. 
   reversals allow certain other orderings of these goals to be attempted. 	however  l i m i t i n g reversals to goals at a p a r t i c u l a r level of the search tree hierarchy means that strips  these arguments also apply to hacker  can only tackle cert a i n problems. 	s p e c i f i c a l l y   	those in which i n t e r -
actions between top level goals can be avoided by suitable ordering of the goals and the choice of suitable operator sequences. 
　　　since strips and hacker also allow attempts to achieve goals to be repeated if interactions 
have occurred  they can also handle those problems

an i n t e r a c t i o n can be used to suggest appropriate continuations. as an example  the interactions discovered during attempts to solve the goals gl & 

 on a b   ceased to 
strips  by re-achieving che on a b  goal  can solve this problem with a longer than necessary plan because the world produced after i n t e r a c t i o n is such that the goals can s t i l l be achieved. a problem 1 have been considering - the keys & boxes problem  michie  1  - has interactions which would preclude a strips-like problem solver from finding any s o l u t i o n . interactions occur in other problems  a simple example being the problem of swapping the values of two registers of a computer. 

　　　current means-end analysis problem solvers are not capable of solving problems which have certain kinds of goal i n t e r a c t i o n . also  with the exception of some systems at mit  e.g. hacker   they do not use interactions amongst goals to guide the search for a s o l u t i o n . i mentioned e a r l ier that a l l interleavings of goals  and the subgoals needed to achieve those goals  should have the potential of being considered. generally  only very few of the possible interleavings need be considered. an assumption  such as is made by many existing problem solvers  that goals can be achieved in the order given without interaction 
  l i n e a r i l y   i s   however  a very powerful h e u r i s t i c . my own work in problem solving  tate  1  is based upon the powerful heuristics used in strips and other problem solvers  but i am anxious not to l e t these assumptions rule the type of problems which can be dealt w i t h . proven contradictions of these assumptions during problem solving can d i r ect the search to consider appropriate i n t e r leavings of plan parts to remove interactions. 
the information gained from the discovery of 
g1 l i n e a r i l y can lead us to the point  in figure 1

shown in f i g u r e 1. 
we shall say that we promote the precondition. moving it f u r t h e r back through the goals to be worked upon would s t i l l t r y to achieve the conf l i c t i n g goals in the opposite order but would r i s k further p o s s i b i l i t i e s for other intermediate goals to interact with the precondition being p r o moted. note that the promoted precondition  g 1   may interact with e a r l i e r goals and may need to be s h i f t e d again due to d i f f e r e n t i n t e r a c t i o n s . subgoals intermediate bet ween g1 and g1 if they e x i s t 
may need to be promoted also. 
　　　if in both orders the same goals achieved by suitable operator sequences s t i l l interact and cannot hold together  the problem cannot be solved by this approach.
