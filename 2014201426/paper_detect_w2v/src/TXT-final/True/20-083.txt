 
　　e a r l i e r papers   allen and hayes 1  described a compact axiomatic theory which provided a formal basis for temporal reasoning. this theory makes a sharp d i s t i n c t i o n between time points and periods of time. we show here  by considering possible models of the theory  that it can be s l i g h t l y extended to give a better f i t to i n t u i t i o n . in p a r t i c u l a r   the extended theory is preserved under changes of temporal g r a n u l a r i t y . 
timeperiods and meeting 
　　the o r i g i n a l period theory  allen 1  allen & hayes 1   used periods rather than points as i t s temporal p r i m i t i v e .   the terminology used e a r l i e r was ' i n t e r v a l ' rather than ' p e r i o d ' . we have changed to avoid confusion with the mathematical use of ' i n t e r v a l ' .   the thirteen possible relationships between periods  including for example overlapping  inclusion  and before are defined in terms of meets  which we w i l l write as in i n f i x colon  with p:q:r meaning p:q and q:r. the basic axioms of the theory are then as follows: 
ml 	f o r a l l p   q   r   s . 	  p:q 	and p:s and r:q   implies 	r:s 
m1 	f o r a l l p   q   r   s . 	  p:q 	and r:s   implies   p:s xor exists t. 	p : t : s xor exists t. 	r : t : q   
m1 	f o r a l l p. exists q r. 	q:p:r 
m1 	f o r a l l p   q   r   s . 	  p:q:s 	and 	p:r:s   implies 	q-r 
m1 	f o r a l l p q. p:q implies exists r   s . 	r:p:q:s and r: p+q :s 
these f i v e axioms are a l l the assumptions which the theory makes. for a longer discussion of t h e i r implications and j u s t i f i c a t i o n   see   allen and hayes 1  . 
　　a key i n t u i t i o n is that propositions are true or false during periods  rather than at points of time. this overcomes the problem of the 'divided i n s t a n t '  van bentham 1 . consider switching on a l i g h t   so that the proposition   l i g h t on  is f i r s t f a l s e   then immediately t r u e . if the timeperioda are thought of as sets of points  then only a r t i f i c i a l constructions can avoid the dilemma of there being a point at which the l i g h t is neither on nor o f f   or  worse  both on and o f f   .

theory as the 'places' where periods meet. in  allen & hayes 1    a set-theoretic construction is given of points from periods  but we can introduce points d i r e c t l y   and it can be shown that the theory obtained is i d e n t i c a l . we w i l l use variable names u v w .. for points  p   q   r   . . f o r periods  and introduce two functions start and end from periods to points. 
pi 	f o r a l l p q. 	p:q i f f end p -start q  
p1 	f o r a l l u exists p. u-end p  
it is possible now to show that points  whatever they are  have a l l the properties one would d i r e c t l y expect  such as being a t o t a l l y ordered i n f i n i t e set with no limits.we could also s t a r t with points as the p r i m i t i v e idea and define periods as pairs of points from the t o t a l l y ordered set. in   allen and hayes 1   we show how the natural construction of periods from points by forming pairs  u v  is a proper inverse to the derivation of points from periods defined by these axioms  so that such i n t u i t i v e l y compelling results as p- start p  end p   are provable from the axioms. these points  however  are mere mathematical abstractions  and not times at which an event occurs or when some proposition i s t r u e . 
points and moments 
　　points in time are places where periods meet  but they arent themselves periods  not even very short ones. a timeperiod is the sort of thing that an event might occupy: it has substance  while a point is merely an abstraction. consider for example a b a l l tossed i n t o the a i r on the one hand  and a flash of l i g h t n i n g on the other. the time of the b a l l s f l i g h t can be divided into two periods  one of r i s i n g   the other of f a l l i n g . the b a l l spends no actual time at the top of i t s f l i g h t : it does not hover there for a period  no matter how small. the periods of r i s i n g and f a l l i n g meet each other d i r e c t l y . the point at t h e i r meeting is a conceptual abstraction  not a real physical timeperiod. in contrast  the time taken by a f l a s h of l i g h t i n g   although p o i n t l i k e in many ways  must be a period because it contains a r e a l physical event. other things can happen at the same time as the f l a s h   such as a photograph being exposed or a horse dying. this is how we characterise such very b r i e f moments of time: 
f o r a l l p. moment p  i f f not exists q   r . p-q+r i e   a moment is i n d i v i s i b l e i n t o subperiods. 
　　moments have many of the properties of points. for example  if a period has moments at i t s ends then they are unique  and they uniquely define the period between them  by m1. but they also d i f f e r in many ways. for example  being periods  they have d i s t i n c t endpoints.

　　the theory developed so far is somewhat u n i n t u i t i v e on t h i s matter of t r u t h at points and the q u a l i t i e s of moments. on one hand  some points seem to be natural receptacles of t r u t h   and on the other  it is sometimes natural to treat a moment as being more p o i n t l i k e . for example the tossed b a l l s v e r t i c a l v e l o c i t y is positive on the way up  negative on the way down  so must be zero somewhen  by the intermediate value theorem: and the point where these periods meet is the obvious candidate. qualitative reasoning uses such points l i b e r a l l y   and it is hard to see how it could do without them. on the other hand  it seems unnatural to distinguish the s t a r t from the end of a l i g h t n i n g f l a s h   but we must if it is to occupy more than a p o i n t . 
	we 	might 	t r y 	to 	rescue 	the formalism 	by 
' i n s e r t i n g ' a moment whenever a proposition needs to be true at a point. the i n t u i t i v e argument here would be that since the b a l l is motionless  there must be a period - perhaps an ' i n f i n i t e l y short' one  whatever that means - for it to be motionless i n . but t h i s leads to the dual problem: just as points are too small to be occupied by events  moments   as we have defined them   are too long to be suitably i n f i n i t e s i m a l . since a moment is a period  it has d i s t i n c t endpoints  even though no points inside i t . we cant i d e n t i f y these points without denying the existence of the moment i t s e l f   for to i d e n t i f y them is to claim that periods before and after the moment meet  by p i . thus  the time the b a l l comes to rest and the time it starts to f a l l would be separated by an i n t e r v a l during which the b a l l would be hovering  an unacceptable consequence.* 
　　we seem to need to be able to t r e a t moments as points  and vice versa  to capture i n t u i t i o n better. 
mapping moments into points 
　　suppose we introduce a mapping which i d e n t i f i e s the endpoints of moments  so that moments are mapped i n t o p o i n t s . this is what hobbs  1  c a l l s a change of g r a n u l a r i t y . the tolerance r e l a t i o n which defines it in t h i s case is that two periods are indistinguishable if t h e i r endpoints are at most a moment apart. we can define t h i s as follows: 
f o r a l l u v. u-v i f f u-v or moment  u v   or moment  v u   
f o r a l l p q. 	p-q i f f 	s t a r t  p -start  q  
and end p -end q  
　　as hobbs notes  the change of granularity is well-understood only in the case where the tolerance r e l a t i o n is t r a n s i t - v e   and hence is an equivalence r e l a t i o n . it is easy to see that - is t r a n s i t i v e just when moments never meet: 
m1 f o r a l l m n. moment m  and moment n  implies not m:n 
  for if two moments meet  then the s t a r t of the f i r s t does not - the end of the second  . if we add t h i s to our axioms  then the extended theory is preserved under the b l u r r i n g which introduces. we prove t h i s by defining relations which ' i m i t a t e ' those of the basic theory but with a moments ' b l u r ' at t h e i r ends.

the proof is elementary but tedious and omitted here. 
   it is easy to see that if -- is equality  then the r e l a t i o n :: reduces to the p r i m i t i v e : and s i m i l a r l y ++ becomes the same as +. hence  the axioms m1/-m1' may be regarded as the theory of - -equivalence classes. 
　　this result shows that the theory with m1 applies uniformly at any l e v e l of coarsness in which moments are i d e n t i f i e d with t h e i r endpoints. we can reason about periods and move f l e x i b l y from one l e v e l of acuity to another  needing only a truth-maintenance system to keep track of the various g r a n u l a r i t y assumptions being made from time to time. 
　　this seems to provide a solution to the i n t u i t i v e problems with which we began. a moment can be treated as a p o i n t   or vice versa  without changing the axioms of the temporal theory. the extended theory is stable under changes of scale. notice that since the blurred r e l a t i o n includes the basic meets r e l a t i o n   we could use both r e l a t i o n s in a description  and the theory would s t i l l be preserved under :: collapsing  so that we do not have to t r e a t a l l the moments as points or vice versa. thus  in the balltoss example  the topmost point can be talked of as though it were a moment  but a l l other points r e t a i n t h e i r i n f e r i o r status as r e a l points which do not expand i n t o moments and in which nothing can be asserted. or as an a l t e r n a t i v e   we could claim that a l l points have t h i s expandable status  and then be forced into describing the door's status at the moment it closes. 
　　i n t u i t i v e arguments for the reasonableness of m1 include the idea of perceptual acuity. when two dots are close enough  we perceive them as one. imagine three dots x y z with x and y so close that they would seem d o t - l i k e if seen alone  and s i m i l a r l y y and z. one now perceives a short l i n e   a dash. two adjacent s p a t i a l 'moments' become a short  dense  ' p e r i o d ' . adjacent 'moments' cannot be perceived. s i m i l a r l y   for example  a succession of flashes with no periods between them are seen as a continuous l i g h t f i l l i n g an period  which is why the movies work. 
   however  it is not yet clear what the models of the theory with m1 are. in the next section we w i l l show that they are s i m i l a r to the usual model of continuous time as the r a t i o n a l or r e a l l i n e . 

models of the theory 
　　the axiom m1 seems rather strange at f i r s t sight  since in the two most obvious categories of model of the basic theory  it is either vacuous or f a l s e . these  are respectively the dense and discrete models. in the l a t t e r   time is clock time  a sequence of discrete t i c k s . while many nonstandard models e x i s t   the simplest is of course the integers. in these models  every moment meets the next moment  and so m1 is as false as it can be  everywhere. on the other hand  in a dense model  every period can be s p l i t into consecutive subperiods  so no moments exist  and m1 is true but boring. however  there is a n o n t r i v i a l class of models which are neatly 
characterised by m1. 
　　in a dense model  the points must form an unbounded dense linear o r d e r . i f the model is countable   and one always is   then t h i s is the r a t i o n a l l i n e   but everything here applies equally well to the reals. periods then can be interpreted as open i p t e r v a l s   with  a b : b c  defining the meets r e l a t i o n . the fact that the i n t e r v a l s   considered as sets of points  dont contain t h e i r endpoints  is not relevant to the way in which they stand for periods in t h i s model. an exactly isomorphic model is obtained by i n t e r p r e t i n g periods as closed intervals with   a   b   :   b   c     for example. 
　　notice however what happens if we include all r a t i o n a l i n t e r v a l s   open and closed  and t r y to define meeting in the i n t u i t i v e l y straightforward way which takes account of intervals as sets of points. take for example the intervals 

called  say  p q r and s respectively. then we would want it to be true that p:r and q:s  but not that p:s. it follows then   from m1 and a l i t t l e work   that there must be an period t such that p : t : s . the only candidate for such an period is the singleton {b}  ie the closed i n t e r v a l   b   . now t h i s must be a moment  since evidently  b  has no subperiods. so t h i s i n t e r p r e t a t i o n is not a model of the dense theory. on the other hand  it c e r t a i n l y is not isomorphic to the integers of the discrete model. in f a c t   t h i s is a  rather extreme  example of a 
t h i r d class of i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s   in which moments are i n t u i t i v e l y p o i n t - l i k e . 
　　the general form of a model of t h i s sort c a l l it a packed model - over the r a t i o n a l s   is as follows. the domain of periods contains open r a t i o n a l i n t e r v a l s and perhaps some singleton closed i n t e r v a l s   and a l l intervals which can be generated by taking the i n t e r i o r s of the unions of the closures  and the simple concatenation  of other i n t e r v a l s . thus if it contains  a b  and  b c  and   d     then it w i l l also contain  a c    b d  and  a d   for example. meets is defined as f o l l o w s : if  b  is not in the domain  then   a   b   :   b   c   ; but otherwise  meets is interpreted s e t t h e o r e t i c a l l y   so that   a   b   :   b   :   b   c    and   a   b   :   b   c     e t c . . at one extreme  a packed model is simply a dense model when no closed singleton instants are present. at the other  it i s the f u l l y s e t - t h e o r e t i c a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n i n which periods are r a t i o n a l i n t e r v a l s . but many others are possible  for example one in which the only singleton moments are the integers  or where parts of the l i n e are dense  parts dense with moments; or where just a few isolated points are distinguished as being the i n t e r i o r s of moments. 
　　these singleton i n t e r v a l s   being periods  have d i s t i n c t endpoints. thus in a crowded model  the 
axioms p i   p1 assert the existence of ' p o i n t s ' on either side of a r a t i o n a l p o i n t : s t a r t     a     and end  a  . the granularity-coarsening mapping defined e a l r l i e r can be seen as making the claim that t h i s d i s t i n c t i o n i s i r r e l e v a n t . 
　　it follows from the e a r l i e r result that there is no way of formalising the d i s t i n c t i o n between these p o i n t - i n t e r v a l s and more substantial moments w i t h i n the vocabulary of the time theory so far developed. one can see t h i s i n t u i t i v e l y by observing that any model which contains such instants can be replaced by a model in which instants are r e a l i n t e r v a l s   simply by ' s t r e t c h i n g ' the l i n e apart at those positions and i n s e r t i n g a gap. exactly the same sentences in the language would be made true by such a stretched model  since these enlarged gaps would contain no meeting-points referred to by the sentences of the theory  so would be moments just as before: and the way they interact with the other periods w i l l be unchanged. in order to express the d i s t i n c t i o n   we would need to introduce some way of t a l k i n g about the size or duration of periods  and then p o i n t - i n t e r v a l s are moments with no duration. 
　the o v e r a l l picture is t h i s . the axiom m1 forces us to interpret moments as things with no extent  merely p o i n t l i k e objects  and also exactly permits us to systematically t r e a t them as points w i t h i n the same theory  by a simple change of g r a n u l a r i t y . thus there can be a moment during which the tossed b a l l s velocity is zero  and we can consistently t r e a t it as though it were a p o i n t . and when we examine the models of our assumptions  there turns out to be a 
　single point  in fact  where the moment should be. and yet other periods can meet d i r e c t l y   when time is dense  without there being moments between them. so we can have our moments and eat them.
