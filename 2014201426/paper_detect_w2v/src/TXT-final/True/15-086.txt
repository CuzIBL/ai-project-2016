i t i s convenient t o d e s c r i b e n o n - d e d u c t i v e reasoning as a kind of d e p a r t u r e from f u l l 
d e d u c t i o n . 	this 	is done by posing 	some paradigm 	argument 	schemes a p p r o p r i a t e 	to g i v e n 	problem areas and 	then d e s c r i b i n g the 	stratagms 	t h a t ensue when one of 	the premises of 	the model 	argument 	is 	f a l s e . 1 w i l l be concerned w i t h two such p a r a digms  	one 	for e v i d e n t i a l 	reasoning 	and one 	for 	reasoning 	to 	a c t i o n s . 
1. 	e v i d e n t i a l reasoning 
	the 	paradigm argument 	i s

 1  y is e x p l a i n e d by something or o t h e r . 
	 c  	x 	  i s t r u e   
       roughly  the c o n t e x t in which the paradigm is r e l e v a n t is one in which some f a c t y i n v i t i n g e x p l a n a t i o n is known and some o t h e r f a c t x  if t r u e   would e x p l a i n y. with premises   1      1  and  1  the 

argument to x i s a d e d u c t i v e one. in the normal l i f e o f r e a s o n i n g   something l i k e  1  is f r e q u e n t l y known and  1  is simply presupposed  though it is f a l s e in some domains such a quantum mechanics . howe v e r    1  is almost always f a l s e   because t h e r e are always e x p l a n a t i o n s t h a t r i v a l the one i s o l a t e d in the c o n c l u s i o n . 
       in response to the f a c t t h a t  1  is f a l s e reasoners engage i n v a r i o u s s t r a tagms designed to i s o l a t e some c o n c l u s i o n from the other candidates as c l e a r l y b e t t e r or more p l a u s i b l e . such s t r a t e g i e s e x h i b i t a s t r u c t u r e at l e a s t as c o m p l i cated as the f o l l o w i n g method of p r o c e d u r e .

       thus  some f a c t   such as a noise in the next room  may i n i t i a t e step   1     f o l lowed by s t e p   1     the f o r m u l a t i o n of e x p l a n a t i o n s o f the f a c t   f o l l o w e d i n t u r n by   1     a ranking of the e x p l a n a t i o n s in order of p l a u s i b i l i t y . one may then a r t i c u l a t e some f a c t   which i f d i s c o v e r e d would c l e a r l y a l t e r the r a n k i n g . one must e i t h e r r e t u r n to the f o r m u l a t i o n of new e x p l a n a t i o n s or to  1  to determine whether any of the f a c t s devised in  1  o b t a i n and a l t e r the c u r r e n t ranking a c c o r d i n g l y . e v e n t u a l l y   the method of procedure w i l l be abandoned  in a sense to be discussed anon  by a c t i n g on the c o n c l u s i o n a t the t o p o f the p l a u s i b i l i t y r a n k i n g . 
¡¡¡¡the method of procedure 	is not an a l g o r i t h m   	since 	the branching 	a t 	steps  1  	and 	  1     	is the p o i n t at which abandonment 	 jummping 	out  	o c c u r s   	is not d e t e r m i n i s t i c . 	this 	is a 	r e f l e c t i o n of the 	f a c t 	t h a t 	the 	reasoning 	i s nond e d u c t i v e   	i . e .   	though the argument 	from p to q may be a p e r f e c t l y good one  the d e n i a l of q does not 	f o r c e the d e n i a l 	of p. 	t h i s is due to the 	f a c t t h a t p is s i m -

1. 	reasoning to a c t i o n s 
       a second s o r t of reasoning is r e a s o n ing to a c t i o n s   represented by the f o l l o w ing paradigm: 
  1  there 	is a 	reason to do x. 
  1  there is no reason to do o t h e r than x. 
  1  one ought to do something or o t h e r . 
	 c  	one ought to do x. 
       as b e f o r e   premise  1  is f r e q u e n t l y s i m p l y known   1  is s u p p l i e d by the c o n t e x t   but  1  i s u s u a l l y f a l s e   since r e a sons to do other than x are u s u a l l y abund a n t . the f a l s i t y of  1  is met by an a p p r o p r i a t e a b s t r a c t r a t i o n a l procedure whose o b j e c t i t i s t o i s o l a t e one a c t i o n as b e t t e r supported than any o t h e r . in the i n t e r e s t s of e f f i c i e n c y   we s h a l l not rehearse the procedures  which can be r a t h e r complicated  we w i l l use the method of procedure f o r e v i d e n t i a l reasoning as g r i s t f o r f u r t h e r i n v e s t i g a t i o n . 
1. 	the problem of detachment 
       the procedures f o r r a t i o n a l l y responding to the absence of d e d u c t i v e 
v a l i d i t y are not a l g o r i t h m s in a s t r o n g sense. in the procedure f o r e v i d e n t i a l r e a s o n i n g   steps  1  and  1  are non-
d e t e r m i n i s t i c . 	most 	i m p o r t a n t   	t h e r e 	i s n o 	p r o v i s i o n 	f o r 	h a l t i n g   	i . e .   	the i n s t r u c t i o n s do not determine when 	to 	jump 
out of or abandon the 	procedure and b e l i e v e 	the c o n c l u s i o n   	or do the a c t i o n   c u r r e n t l y best 	s u p p o r t e d . 	thus 	is the problem of detachment  	the problem of a r t i c u l a t i n g 	a c r i t e r i o n w i t h which 	t o ' d e t a c h ' 	a c o n c l u s i o n 	  a c t i o n or b e l i e f   from 	the 	r a t i o n c i n a t i o n 	i t 	i s embedded 	i n . 
       foremost is the problem of c h a r a c t e r i z i n g what it means to d e t a c h . in the 
case o f reasoning t o a c t i o n t h i s i s f a i r l y s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d ; one detaches by doing the a c t i o n best s u p p o r t e d . in the case of e v i d e n t i a l r e a s o n i n g   the c h a r a c t e r i z a t i o n r e q u i r e s g r e a t e r s u b t l e t y . for present purposes  we w i l l use the u n a t t r a c t i v e e x p r e s s i o n - f o r which i have found to s u b s t i t u t e -   g o w i t h   . to detach is to go w i t h the c u r r e n t best supported h y p o t h e s i s o r c o n c l u s i o n .

¡¡¡¡¡¡detachment can be forced by c i r cumstances. this is it may be rational to go with a conclusion because circumstances demand going with some hypothesis or other and r a t i o n a l i t y demands that this be the hypothesis at the top of the p l a u s i b i l i t y ranking. more importantly  detachability is a value dependant t r a i t   as is shown by 
an example o r i g i n a l l y constructed by scriven. suppose that one wishes to haul a bail of hay to an upper story l o f t with and a rope and pully and there is some evidences as to whether the rope is strong enough. one can imagine the kinds of e v i dence marshalled to elevate the conclusion that the rope of sufficient strength to the top of the p l a u s i b i l i t y ranking. one may inspect the rope for defects  give it a strong yank  et cetera. imagine the evidence that would settle the matter. now imagine the item to be hoisted to be not a bail of hay but one's daughter  which we may assume weighs the same as the b a i l . one w i l l probably observe that the evidence imagined to be sufficient for hay is inadequate to the question of hoisting 
one's daughter. 	what this reveals is that 
the value component in non-deductive reasoning  that what it is rational to 
detach-conclude--non-deductively is in part a function of one's values. this is of course untrue of deductive reasoning which is valid or not independent of the consequences of being wrong. 
1. 	the role of explanat ion and understanding 
       the two species of reasoning for which model arguments were provided share in common the concept of explanation--and i t s correlative concept  understanding--at their core. in the case of evidential reasoning  we judge that x is evidence for y if and only if y explains x. the role of explanation in reasoning to actions is less obvious. in general  to say that a person p does an action a for reason r 
means something l i k e   
 1  p knows  or believes  r  and 
 1  the fact that p knows  believes  r explains why p does a. 
thus  a reason is a fact an agent's knowledge of which would explain the his performance of some action. 
¡¡¡¡¡¡what this is implies is that one global constraint on reasoning is explanatory coherence  or coherence of understanding. that i s   p l a u s i b i l i t y judgements are driven by perceptions of the degree to which a given conclusion candidate coheres e x p l a n i t o r i l y with the remainder of one's of comprehension are automatic conse-
quences of information processing strategies designed to maximize e f f i c i e n t storage and retrieval while interacting with an informationally rich environment. indeed  according to this view  comprehension is the disposition or capacity for effective storage and retrieval under the constraint of the impossibility of total storage; that i s   maximizing storage and r e t r i e v a l in an environment so rich that complete storage is impossible. 
¡¡¡¡¡¡thus  one can identify something like a connection between something computable and the apparently vague concepts of explanation and understanding that l i e at the core of non-deductive reasoning--if the described paradigms are characterist i c . in any case  the relevance of the philosophic l i t e r a t u r e on non-deductive reasoning that does not reconstruct such reasoning deductively is i hope made more plausbile by these remarks.
