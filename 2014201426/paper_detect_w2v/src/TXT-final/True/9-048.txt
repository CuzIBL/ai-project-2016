　　　the information-processing model of human motivation to be described in t h i s paper has been constructed as a part of a p r o j e c t directed at the i n v e s t i g a t i o n of computer techniques in c l i n i c a l psychology and psychiatry. the p r o j e c t is in an early planning stage. the u l t i m a t e aim is to construct computer-based systems capable of i n t e l l i g e n t and h e l p f u l i n t e r a c t i o n w i t h people seeking p s y c h i a t r i c help. the general o r i e n t a t i o n of the p r o j e c t is based on the assumption that such systems w i l l r e q u i r e an adequate model of human psychology at the l e v e l u s u a l l y found in personality theories w i t h i n psychology. the m o t i v a t i o n model put forward here is intended as an element towards the development of such a comprehensive model on the basis of computational 
 information-processing  	concepts. 
　　　our p o i n t of view of personality is that of a set of basic resources organised i n t o a h e t e r a r c h i c a l system. these resources are formed by information structures which include both prooesses and data s t r u c t u r e s   o b j e c t s   . the heterarohioal organisation implies that these resources are used in complex i n t e r a c t i o n w i t h each other in order to synthesize h i g h - l e v e l psychological functions   l i k e memory  perception  t h i n k i n g   . there can be no abaolute separation of these resources from each other and from the h i g h e r - l e v e l functions. the p a r t i t i o n i n g of personality i n t o auch resources w i l l always depend on the p a r t i c u l a r p o i n t of view adopted for some a p e c i f i c purpose. this is the general problem of representation in modelling complex systems. it must be recognised that there is no unique s o l u t i o n to t h i s problem  but t h a t solutions may be b e t t e r or worse depending on the purpose f o r which they are used. 
　　　we s h a l l adopt a d i v i s i o n of p e r s o n a l i t y i n t o resources  which is reasonably close both to common sense and to t r a d i t i o n a l views in the psychology of p e r s o n a l i t y . the proposed d i v i s i o n has f i v e resources:

the general framework 
       motivation needs to be treated w i t h i n a general theory of human a c t i o n . there is a considerable l i t e r a t u r e on t h i s problem both in psychology  mischel  1; cofer & appley  1; ryan  1; atkinson  1; bindra & stewart  1; james  1; to mention but a few   and in philosophy  anscombe  1; kenny  1; meiland  1; peters  1; white  1 . our approach is e c l e c t i c   and owes much to such sources. at the same time it has some new f e a t u r e s   r e s u l t i n g from our attempt to formulate a model which could be implemented in the form of computer programs. 
　　　an agent  a person  executes an a c t i o n in order to bring something about. something is brought about by making it happen  by causing events. an a c t i o n is the exercise of the power to cause events   c f . white  1  pp. 1 - 1   . events are changes in a s i t u a t i o n . s i t u a t i o n s are states of the world  mccarthy  1 . 
       a peraon has an i n t e r n a l representation  a model  of the s i t u a t i o n at any given time. this model inoludes the representations of the environment  of other persons in the s i t u a t i o n   and of the person himself. various mental processes  i n t e r n a l to the person  are also parts of the s i t u a t i o n and may be represented in the model. the same holds f o r the mental processes and objects   i n f o r m a t i o n s t r u c t u r e s   of other parsons in the s i t u a t i o n . 
　　　the fundamental problem of m o t i v a t i o n is to characterise the r e l a t i o n s h i p between a person's purposes and actions. the purpose towards which an a c t i o n is directed we s h a l l c a l l a g o a l . in g e n e r a l   a goal is a representation of a s i t u a t i o n . the parson acta i n order t o b r i n g t h i s s i t u a t i o n about  i . e .   cause the s i t u a t i o n to change through eventa ao t h a t as a r e s u l t of the a c t i o n it w i l l agree w i t h the g o a l . 
1        hot a l l representations of s i t u a t i o n s are goals. when a representation is a g o a l   t h i s indicates t h a t the s i t u a t i o n is regarded aa desirable by the person  i . e . i t has value f o r him. i n the f i n a l analysis i t i s t h i s d e s i r a b i l i t y  value  u t i l i t y   o f goals which motivates behaviour. we s h a l l not in t h i s paper t r y to analyse how values are attached to goals or why t h i s 
happens. as to the question of how  we see scope for both learning and genetic mechanisms. as to the question of why  we adopt a position labelled 'rational hedonism' by g. a. miller  1   and assume that values originate from pleasure  but not necessarily sensory pleasure. pursuing this point further would take us into the area of affect  so we leave further discussion for a future paper. let us note however  that here we reached one particular interface between the motivational and affective resources. 
　　　the goals for action may come from a variety of sources. psychologists and philosophers tend to make distinctions on the basis of time  past or future reasons   internal or external factors  patera  1   physiological .or psychological factors  etc. we shall not be concerned with these distinctions  important though they are  since in our view they do not form part of the motivational mechanisms themselves. our criterion for any factor to become motivational is that the person should set up a corresponding goal with an 
assignable value. events leading to setting up of goals may be found in physiological processes  social circumstances  physical circumstances  psychological processes  and elsewhere. 
wishes and wants 
we shall describe the result of setting up a goal  
i.e. the result of attaching a value to a description of a situation  by saying that the person has a wiah for that goal. a wish ia simply a recognition of the fact that a certain situation ia desirable. having a wish for a goal does not imply action. it is thus possible to wish for goals which are impossible at the time  or ever. when the goal of a wish la reached  the wish is satisfied   f u l f i l l e d   . by definition  a wish cannot be f u l f i l l e d by the result of an action of the person having that wiah  although it may be f u l f i l l e d 
as a consequence of an action   since the person does not intend to do anything about his wish.  the distinction between the results and consequences of an action is due to von wright  1.  
　　　the difference between a wish and a want is that the person is intending to do something in order to reach the goal of the want. note that 'intending to do something does not mean the same as intending to take a particular action which w i l l bring about the goal. having a want of a goal simply means that the person is allocating some resources towards taking some action. this process of allocating resources is the function of the w i l l   to which we now turn. 
the will and mental effort 
　　　the function of the w i l l is to allocate resources to the processes of reaching goal*. will power is the investment of resources. the resources of a person are f i n i t e and ongoing goal processes have to compete for them. these resources include both the physical and the psychological  although hare we shall be concerned only with the latter. 
　　　at the most fundamental level the resources are space  for - memory  and time  for processing  in an information processing system. together these resources oan be used to define the amount of computational work required for some process  savage  1 . 
　　　many treatments of motivation in the paat have made use of an energy analogy to convey the notion that 
one important aspect of motivation is the 'energising' of behaviour. two clear examples are provided by freudian and ethologist  e.g. tinbergen  1  theories. these theories discuss motivation in terms of the availability  storage  and utilisation of 'psychic energy'  sometimes incorporating 'hydraulic' ideas like reservoirs  overflow  releasing valves  etc. it has always been recognised  both by these writers and their critics  that the energy concept la only a loose analogy. the relation of 'psychic energy' to physical energy has never been clearly indicated by freud  and ia his later writings it seems to be treated as an 'inferential abstraction without specific physical referent  cofer & appley  1  p. 1 . rapoport  1   however  has unearthed a rather interesting quote from freud's 'three essays on sexuality'  in which the concept is defined as f o l l o w 'the quantum of psychic energy ia a measure of the demand made upon the mind for work'. this definition ia closely related to the ideas we are putting forward here. 
　　　we propose that mental work is to be measured in terms of the computational work performed  i.e. in terms of the number of equivalent logical operations which need to be executed in order to perform a computation  aee savage   for a detailed quantitative treatment of computational work . the psychic energy' concept is to be replaced by the 
concept of computational work. 
　　　let us now return to the w i l l and mental effort. we have interpreted the w i l l as the allocation of resources to competing processes. since we are confining ourselves to psychological  mental  processes  the resource is computational work. we now propose that mental effort is the manifestation in consciousness  central control  of the allocation and expenditure of mental work. we need to distinguish at least two aspects. subjective feeling of effort is involved in completing a process if the amount of 
computational work involved 	is 	large. 	this 	ia 	the 
'alow dead heave of the w i l l ' idea of william james  1  vol. i i   p. 1 . feeling of effort is also involved in matters relating to the interruption of ongoing activities and the initiation of new activities. this kind of effort is often labelled 'concentration' if it is a matter of protecting a process from interruption  or an aot of w i l l if it i a matter of interrupting a pleasurable process in order to do something else. an example of the latter is william james's  1  vol. i i   p. 1  famous description of getting up on a cold morning. 
　　　we also need to distinguish between resource allocation for purely symbolic internal processing without external action  and allocation involving the formulation and execution of intentions and external actions. special status needs to be given to external actions  because this ia what distinguishes daydreaming and fantasy about one's wishes  from doing something about them. 
　　　in summary  the w i l l involves resource allocation  partly in the sense of the amount of computational work a process can use  and partly in the sense of the relative priorities of processes over each other as to when they can use up computational work. 
1 　　　it oan be seen that in some respects our interpretation of the w i l l parallels the situation in a modern time-sharing computer system where several users compete for the computational resources  cpu  memory  peripherals  etc   and a supervisor allocates quotas so that everyone gets a fair deal. 
　　　let us close thia section by pointing out that the w i l l ia an interface between the motivational and central control mechanisms and ia thus another example of the many points of interaction between the components of the personality system described in an earlier section. 
the control of multiple goal processes 
　　　in the previous section we have already introduced a point of view in which each goal is associated with a proceaa directed at the achievement of the goal. we ere using the concept of a process in the technics* 1 sense in which it has come into use recently in computer science in connection with the design of time-sharing systems  see  for example  colin  1 . the several processes belonging to the coexisting set of goals of a person are executed as parallel  cooperating processes. this means that the processes share both control and acceas environments in the sense of bobrow & wegbreit  1 . 
　　　the degree to which the goal processes communicate with each other and pass control among themselves is assumed to be much greater than that occurring in time-sharing computer systems  so that in this respect our analogy becomes inaccurate. 
　　　the parallel cooperating execution of goal processes implies that the achievement of several goals is being carried forward simultaneously over some time interval  since  although control resides in one particular process at any moment  the mutual interruption  suspension  i n i t i a t i o n   and resumption of the processes ensures that some effort is invested in a range of goals at the same time. 
　　　this multiple-process view also makes it possible to incorporate another important aspect of human motivation  namely  that any particular action is usually chosen in such a way that it contributes to several goals simultaneously. the need for multiple goal evaluation is recognised and discussed by fikes  hart a kilason  1 . we propose to make use of the standard ai technique of generating possible actions in the planning stage  see below  on the basis of one goal process  which we shall call the regnant goal process  following murray  1   and evaluating it against the ourrent states of the other existing goal processes. 
　　　let us now turn to another aspect of controlling goal-directed activity. why does activity stop  this depends on the nature of the goal. some goals can be reached completely  eliminating any associated wish or want. others can only be reached partially and some evaluation of the state of a goal tree is needed in order to decide whether some associated wish or want is to be wound up or not. this is simon's  1  idea of 'satisficing*. some goals require the indefinite continuation or recurrence of some activity or situation. a goal process may also stop because it ran out of the allocated resources  or because it was 
interrupted by some other process. 
planning and intentions 
　　　we shall now turn to the processes which may intervene between the setting up of goals  wishes  and 
wants on the one hand  and the actual execution of actions on the other. these processes are planning  choice  decision-making   and forming intentions. 
　　　once a goal has become regnant  in the aense of assuming control   a plan for action needa to be formulated to bring the goal about. planning is assumed to be a complex activity  recursively using a l l the resources of the system. clearly  it ia heavily dependent on the knowledge and reasoning resources in retrieving possible actions and evaluating them in terms of their results and consequences relative to a l l relevant ourrent goals in the system. these kinds of knowledge are referred to by sloman  1a  as the 'resource store  resource catalogue  and a store of environmental information  beliefs  . 
　　　planning is a process which uses both knowledge of a general kind  knowledge of the world in general   and also knowledge of a ourrent situation. the influence of situational knowledge is underestimated in some current ai programs  since they mostly operate in environments containing only one agent  e.g. a robot . the depth of planning which can be usefully undertaken depends heavily on the predictability of the environment  as oan be seen in game-playing programs which have to take into account events produced by other agents. for this reason planning cannot be separated out as an independent  self-contained process  but has to be f i t t e d into the heterarchical organisation as an activity taking place in parallel and in interaction with the other ongoing process. 
　　　we shall not go into the details of the planning process itbelf  since planning and problem-solving are perhaps the best developed areas in ai and we expect that the goal-reduction and state-space approaches 
would be readily applicable for our purposes. 
     the process of planning usually uncovers a set of alternative possibilities. these alternatives need to be evaluated with respect to a large range of criteria including  among other things  relevant current goals  preferences  expectancy of success  atkinson  1   likes  principles  etc.  see sloman  1b  for a more detailed discussion  although sloman regards these criteria as motivating factors  with which we disagree  . the process of taking these criteria into account in an evaluation leads to a choice  decision-making  between the alternatives. the evaluation of alternatives with respect to relevant current goals makes it possible for wishes to have an influence on eventual behaviour even though wishes do not directly generate actions  since they have no resources for this. presumably this indirect influence is the mechanism behind 'freudian slips'. 
1 　　　the outcome of decision-making is the adoption of the best plan for execution. the plan i t s e l f is a prescription of an action  activity  or of the performance of a complex procedure  actions  activities  and performances are distinguished according to the nature of their results and the manner in which the result is obtained   see evans  1  for these  and even finer distinctions  . the state of affaire resulting from the adoption of a plan we shall refer to as having an intention. a peraon intends to do something  intends to carry out an action  when he has a plan which he has decided to execute. the amount of detail which may be present in the plan at the time of thia decision may vary widely. if the plan ia sketchy  the whole of the system may need to be called recursively to make its execution possible. 
active and reactive aspects o♀ motivation 
       the interaction between a person and the environment has both active and reactive aspects. the active aspect is involved in the execution of actions based on regnant goals. the equally important reactive aspect is concerned with actions based on events in the situation. this distinction relates only to the way in which actions are initiated and not to the way in which their execution is controlled. 
       the execution of a plan based on a regnant goal takes place in an environment which is only partially under the agent s control. events may occur in this environment which have not been foreseen in the plan. such unexpected events call for the initiation of reactions to ensure that the execution of current plans can continue. 
       reactions to unexpected events may call for means-ands analysis  planning  and the formulation of intentions in much the same way as active behaviour. however  the distinctive characteristic of reactive behaviour is that it implies a constant monitoring of events through various levels of attention in the perceptual processes  in order to determine their relevance to the currently existing goals. we assume that this is done by setting up perceptual senemas  possibly of quite a crude nature  to watch out for. when such a pattern is detected by low-level sensory and perceptual processes  attention is drawn to the event by causing an interruption of the ongoing activity in central control in order to enable a more detailed evaluation of the event against a l l relevant goals. depending on the priorities of these goals  planning and action may be set into motion by central control. the evaluation is aided by the response of the affective system  to be discussed in detail elsewhere  which contributes a quick  simplified evaluation and partly determines whether an interrupt should occur  simon  1   
       since events are evaluated against a l l relevant goals  we now have a mechanism through which wishes can exert an influence on behaviour  even though the w i l l has not invested resources in them for external action. the reaction to an event which is relevant to a goal can be influenced by the existence of the associated wish. one form of t h i s influence may well be the changing of the wish i n t o a want  if the event indicates that previously existing obstacles to action towards the goal have been removed. this mechanism i s   e f f e c t i v e l y   the releasing mechanism' of the etholagists  and the incentive stimulation of bindra  1   and others. 
       we believe that it is extremely important to incorporate both aspects  active and reactive  of the motivational phenomena in our model. undue emphasis on the inner urge aspect  characteristic of many psychodynamically based theories of motivation  or on the 'environmental p u l l '   both unduly r e s t r i c t the scope of a theory.
