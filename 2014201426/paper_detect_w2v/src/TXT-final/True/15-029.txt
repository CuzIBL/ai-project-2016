 
　　　the usual approach to plausible reasoning is to associate a validity measure with each fact or rule  and to compute from these a validity measure for any deduction that is made. this approach is shown to be inappropriate for some classes of problems  particularly those in which the evidence is not internally consistent. two current plausible reasoning architectures are summarized and each applied to the same small task. an analysis of the performance of these systems reveals deficiencies 
in each case. the paper then outlines a new approach based on the discovery of consistent subsets of the given evidence. this system can be used either in isolation or in conjunction with a validity-propagating architecture. comparative results from implementations of a l l three systems are presented. 
	1. 	introduction 
　　　research in expert systems is concerned with how to represent and reproduce the problem-solving skills that experts exhibit in their respective 
domains. one of the most basic of these skills is the ability to put two and two together-to draw reasoned conclusions that supplement direct observations. this poses a difficulty because our models of reasoning are derived from the deduction mechanisms of logic  but investigators have noted that expert reasoning cannot be understood in terms of such precise schema. logic deals with an idealized world in which facts are known with certainty and rules of inference allow other facts to be deduced with equal certainty. experts  on the other hand  are usually required to form judgments based on evidence that may be subject to errors of measurement or interpretation. again  experts can function in environments containing inconsistent or contradictory  facts   but such environments are useless in the logical sense. 
　　　systems for expert-like reasoning typically work with unquantified propositions and relations among them. propositions may be facts   the car won't start    hypotheses   the trouble is in the ignition system    findings   the distributor cap

nsw institute of technology  sydney 1 australia is defective    or any concept in the domain that is relevant to the expert's problem-solving behaviour. relations connecting subsets of the propositions are usually expressed as logical definitions   a is the conjunction of b  c  and d   or inferential links   if a is true  then so is b  . the feature that distinguishes uncertain inference from the familiar propositional calculus is the qualified nature of knowledge about both the relations and propositions. instead of being either true or false  propositions have associated with them some continuous measure of their validity. inferential relations also have a validity measure that weakens the connection between antecedent and consequent; the relation  if a  then b  may support a less-than-categorical affirmation of b even when a is known with certainty. 
　　　a useful way of viewing this formalism is as an inference net  duda  gaschnig  and hart  1  in which propositions are nodes and the relations among propositions become the links of the network. whenever the validity measure of a node is changed  such as by the arrival of new evidence  this infor-
mation propagates along the links to related nodes and may cause changes to their validity measures in turn. the secondary changes propagate in the same way so that the evidence responsible for the i n i t i a l change may be reflected in altered validity 
measures of many propositions. 
　　　the general inference net framework does not address the important questions of how validity is to be represented and how the propagation above is to be carried out. some approaches measure the validity of a proposition as its posterior probab i l i t y given a l l the evidence to hand  computed via bayes' theorem and ancillary assumptions. others use probability intervals rather than point probabilities as a measure of validity  relying on more general schemes of updating such as the dempster-shafer theory of evidence  garvey  lowrance  and fischler  1 . it is not uncommon for the form of the inference net to be restricted; for example   pearl  1  requires that it be a tree. many systems treat the links representing relations as directional  so that the relation   i f a  then b  allows updating of b's validity when a is known to be true but does not allow a's 
validity to be altered if b is found to be false. a review and critique of the more common approaches can be found in  quinlan  1 . 

j. quinlan 
       expert systems embodying mechanisms for uncert a i n inference have achieved notable successes  as documented in recent reports  buchanan  1; campbell  h o i l i s t e r   duda  and hart  1  on two pioneering e f f o r t s   mycin and prospector. nevertheless  there appear to be a p p l i c a t i o n s r e q u i r i n g an uncertain inference c a p a b i l i t y that are not handled w e l l by any current system. the characte r i s t i c s of these applications are discussed l a t e r   but the g i s t of the d i f f i c u l t y and the proposed s o l u t i o n can be obtained from the f o l l o w ing example. 
       table tl contains the ten assertions that define the model. numbers in brackets f o l l o w i n g assertions are v a l i d i t y measures in the range 1 to 1; two such numbers f o l l o w i n g an assertion correspond to the   i f   and  only i f   cases r e s p e c t i v e l y . since we have not defined what we mean by   v a l i d i t y     the precise i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of these numbers is open. a proposition or r e l a t i o n with v a l i d i t y 1 is correct without q u a l i f i c a t i o n and one with v a l i d i t y 1 is f a l s e   but any of the d i f f e r e n t meanings of a middle-ground v a l i d i t y that are used in current systems w i l   be acceptable. 

　　　consider the task of a f i c t i o n a l detective i n v e s t i g a t i n g a case in which  as usual  there are 
many apparent c o n t r a d i c t i o n s in the evidence that he unearths. how is he to proceed  current approaches to p l a u s i b l e inference would have him weigh evidence for and against each hypothesis  consider-
ing the hypothesis confirmed to the extent that the balance of evidence supports i t . but any 
mystery buff knows that t h i s approach d i f f e r s from the one poirot would adopt  and might even lead to the anomalous s i t u a t i o n in which the balance of evidence i n d i v i d u a l l y supports propositions a and b  but where a and b cannot both have occurred. this paper suggests an a l t e r n a t i v e method of forming conclusions that our detective  would f i n d moref a m i l i a r . instead of making deductions from c o n t r a d i c t o r y information  we d i v i d e the evidence i n t o two classes  items to be believed and items to be disregarded  so that a l l the evidence in the former category is consistent and  makes sense . where there are many possible d i v i s i o n s we use some model to weigh the v a l i d i t y   not of i n d i v i d u a l p r o p o s i t i o n s   but of the d i v i s i o n i t s e l f . for example  a d i v i s i o n that would require our d e t e c t ive to disregard s i g n i f i c a n t l y more data than 
another might be judged to be less valuable. 
　　　in the f o l l o w i n g sections we examine a seemingly simple uncertain inference problem. taking prospector as an example of a d i r e c t e d baycsian a r c h i t e c t u r e   we show that the problem must be redrafted to meet prospector's requirements and that there are d i f f i c u l t i e s i n t e r p r e t i n g the r e s u l t s . we then describe inferno  a non-directed non-bayesian a r c h i t e c t u r e   and show t h a t it is also less than s a t i s f a c t o r y for t h i s task. this leads to a discussion of ponderosa  a new system t h a t performs uncertain inference by evidence d i v i s i o n rather than by propagation of v a l i d i t y .

	1. 	prospector 
       prospector  duda  hart  and nilsson  1  is a general-purpose a r c h i t e c t u r e for uncertain i n f e r ence t h a t has been used w i t h several geological models and whose basic approach has been taken up by other systems such as al/x  reiter  1 . it is therefore representative of a well-developed school of thought about uncertain inference. 
1 overview of prospector 
　　　prospector takes the v a l i d i t y of a proposition to be i t s p o s t e r i o r p r o b a b i l i t y given the evidence at hand. let h be some p r o p o s i t i o n about which inferences are to be drawn and e another proposi-
t i o n . bayes' theorem gives the posterior probab i l i t y  or l i k e l i h o o d   of h given e as 

where p e  	and p h  	are p r i o r p r o b a b i l i t i e s   and s i m i l a r l y 

assuming that the l a t t e r is non-zero  we can d i v i d e the f i r s t equation by the second to obtain 

which may be stated as  the p o s t e r i o r odds of h is i t s p r i o r odds m u l t i p l i e d by a factor  called x  t h a t characterizes the s u f f i c i e n c y of e as a p r e d i c t o r of h. a s i m i l a r analysis can be performed replacing e by e in the above  and the corresponding factor λ characterizes the necess i t y of e if h is to h o l d . 
this formalism is i n s u f f i c i e n t by i t s e l f to determine what should happen to the odds of h when several propositions e l   e1  . . . are relevant to i t   or when the e's are known w i t h less than c e r t a i n t y . the approach taken in prospector is to make two a d d i t i o n a l assumptions  conditional independence and i n t e r p o l a t i o n   t h a t allow the p o s t e r i o r odds of p r o p o s i t i o n h to be computed as the product of i t s p r i o r odds and e f f e c t i v e 
m u l t i p l y i n g f a c t o r s obtained for each e i . 
i n f e r e n t i a l l i n k s from one p r o p o s i t i o n to another can thus be implmented by choosing appropriate values for the f a c t o r s x and λ. the p o s t e r i o r odds of l o g i c a l combinations of propositions is computed from those of the components  e . g .   if a is the conjunction of b l   b1  . . .   the odds of a 
is the minimum of the odds of any b i . each r e l a t i o n can cause the odds of only one p r o p o s i t i o n t o b e a l t e r e d d i r e c t l y ; i n f e r e n t i a l r e l a t ions   i f e  then h  as before a f f e c t only h  and l o g i c a l r e l a t i o n s as above a f f e c t only a. accordingly  the l i n k s representing r e l a t i o n s are thought of as d i r e c t e d i n t o the affected p r o p o s i t i o n . prospector requires t h a t there be no cycles in the inference net and allows observed 
	j. quinlan 	1 
p r o b a b i l i t i e s to be given only for  evidence  propositions t h a t have no l i n k s d i r e c t e d i n t o them. 
1 applying prospector to the model 
       several d i f f i c u l t i e s arise when we attempt to use the prospector a r c h i t e c t u r e for the model. the more serious of these are consequences of prospector's t a c i t assumption that propositions can be arranged in a hierarchy with inference chains flowing smoothly from raw evidence through to conclusions. 
　　　consider  for example  the proposition  stocks w i l l f a l l   . this appears as evidence in al but as a conclusion in several other assertions. 
again  assertions a1   a1  and a1 provide v a l i d i t i e s for l o g i c a l combinations of p r o p o s i t i o n s   but prospector contains no mechanism that would allow evidence to bear d i r e c t l y on such composite p r o p o s i t i o n s . similar problems arise from a1  a1  and a1  where l o g i c a l combinations are on the receiving end of the i n f e r e n t i a l l i n k s . 
       the steps taken to reformulate the example are as f o l l o w s :  1  the two propositions  stocks w i l l f a l l   and   i n t e r e s t rates w i l l f a l l   that appear both as evidence and as p o t e n t i a l conclusions are represented each by two nodes in the net. the f i r s t is a conventional evidence node w i t h a very strong i n f e r e n t i a l l i n k to the second copy that is also the r e c i p i e n t of other i n f e r e n t i a l l i n k s .  1  assertions such as a1 of the form  a or b  are represented f u n c t i o n a l l y as the pair of inference r e l a t i o n s   i f a is f a l s e   then b  and   i f is b is f a l s e   then a .  1  complex assertions are broken down i n t o more p r i m i t i v e r e l a t i o n s that have a single proposition as the inference. for example  a1  of the form  a or b i f   and only i f   c or d  becomes the set of r e l a t i o n s  and t h e i r symmetric counterparts  

  1  f i n a l l y   a l l p r i o r p r o b a b i l i t i e s are taken by d e f a u l t as 1 since the example does not specify other values  and the strengths of the m u l t i p l i e r s λ and λ' are determined so t h a t   if the r e l a t i o n   i f a  then b  has v a l i d i t y v  the p o s t e r i o r p r o b a b i l i t y of p r o p o s i t i o n b given a is also v. 
　　　even w i t h these changes  the reformulated example v i o l a t e s a prospector p r o h i b i t i o n on cycles in the net. these arise from strong i n t e r connections among the f i v e i n d i c a t o r s   however  and there seems to be no way of e l i m i n a t i n g them. rather than abandon the e n t e r p r i s e   we w i l l genera l i z e the prospector algorithm to allow computat i o n o f p o s t e r i o r p r o b a b i l i t i e s b y r e l a x a t i o n   terminating when changes are small so t h a t cycles w i l l not cause i n f i n i t e loops. 
　　　a p r o s p e c t o r - l i k e system embodying t h i s m o d i f i c a t i o n was used to o b t a i n the r e s u l t s shown in table t1. 	these r e s u l t s are d e f i c i e n t in at l e a s t two respects. 	 1  	they give no h i n t t h a t 

j. quinlan 
the assertions from which the model was derived are i n c o n s i s t e n t . the assumptions that prospector makes w i l l never produce an overconstrained system  so any c o l l e c t i o n of evidence and r e l a t i o n s w i l l lead to a s o l u t i o n .  1  the statement of a r e s u l t as a p r o b a b i l i t y is f i n e when there is only one r e s u l t of i n t e r e s t   but can lead to problems in cases such as t h i s when we need a simultaneous reading on several hypotheses. suppose that the 
model b u i l d e r wished to p r e d i c t the most l i k e l y f u t u r e state from the 1 possible in terms of the f i v e i n d i c a t o r s . converting the p r o b a b i l i t i e s to c a t e g o r i c a l form by thresholding as in table t1 
would lead to the conclusion that 

these conclusions j o i n t l y v i o l a t e the  only i f   p a r t of assertion a1! thus mapping from p r o b a l i s t i c to categorical r e s u l t s for several variables 
may produce conclusions that do not f i t w i t h the evidence. 
       in summary  in order to run our example on prospector we had to make s i g n i f i c a n t a l t e r a t i o n s to the formulation of the model and to modify prospector as w e l l ; even so  the r e s u l t s we obtained were d e f i c i e n t . for a l l these reasons it would seem that prospector is not w e l l - s u i t e d t o t h i s a p p l i c a t i o n . 
       konolige  1  has developed an a l t e r n a t i v e scheme for bayesian inference that finesses many of the d i f f i c u l t i e s above. this scheme  based on information theory  allows n o n - d i r e c t i o n a l propagation among local event groups  each characterized by a complete p r o b a b i l i t y d i s t r i b u t i o n . the 
model could be run without m o d i f i c a t i o n   but the d e f i c i e n c i e s regarding inconsistencies and categ o r i c a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n would seem to remain. 
	1. 	inferno 
　　　inferno  quinlan  1  is another inference network system t h a t was designed around four ideas: 
1. general systems for uncertain inference are b e t t e r o f f without assumptions such as c o n d i t i o n a l independence whose universal v a l i d i t y is suspect  pednault  zucker  and muresan  1 . 
1. on the other hand  it should be possible 
to assert that p a r t i c u l a r groups of propositions e x h i b i t r e l a t i o n s h i p s such as independence. 
1. there should be no r e s t r i c t i o n s on the d i r e c t i o n of information flow in the network. 	 this was the cause of much of prospector's d i f f i c u l t y w i t h the model.  
1. the consistency of the data should be checked and the system should be able to advise on a l t e r n a t i v e methods of r e c t i f y ing inconsistencies 
　　　the e f f e c t of these requirements has been to lead away from prospector-style formalisms. 
1 description of inferno 
       the f i r s t d i f f e r e n c e comes in the way that the v a l i d i t y of a p r o p o s i t i o n is represented. instead of a single p o i n t p r o b a b i l i t y   inferno uses p r o b a b i l i t y bounds; a proposition a is characterized by a lower bound t a  on the p r o b a b i l i t y p a  of a and a lower bound f  a  on p ~a . this approach has two advantages. the uncertainty of our knowledge about a is apparent  being j u s t the d i f f e r e n c e between t a  and 1 - f   a   . second  the values of t a  and f a  are derived from evidence 
tending to support and to deny a r e s p e c t i v e l y   and these values are retained and propagated separately. 
       to achieve the non-directed propagation of inferences as in point  1  above  inferno follows wand  hayes-roth  1  in viewing r e l a t i o n s as c o n s t r a i n t s on the respective v a l i d i t i e s of c o l l e c t i o n s of p r o p o s i t i o n s . changing a p r o b a b i l i t y 
bound of any p r o p o s i t i o n in the c o l l e c t i o n may require some other bound to be a l t e r e d to preserve the c o n s t r a i n t . for example  one form of i n f e r e n t i a l r e l a t i o n   w r i t t e n as 
a enables b w i t h strength x 
is intended to capture the  uncertain  r e l a t i o n   i f a  then b . this r e l a t i o n has two associated c o n s t r a i n t s : 

and thus can cause t b  to be increased when t a  is increased  or f a  to be increased when f b  is increased. logical connections among p r o p o s i t i o n s are handled in the same manner. the r e l a t i o n d e f i n i n g a as the conjunction of b l   b1  . . .   bn gives four c o n s t r a i n t s : for a l l b i   

       these and a l l other inferno c o n s t r a i n t s can be derived from simple p r o b a b i l i t y i d e n t i t i e s without other assumptions. 
　　　this representation supports a p r o b a b i l i s t i c concept of consistency. if t a  +  f a    1 for some p r o p o s i t i o n a  the information about a is i n c o n s i s t e n t and one or both of the bounds must 
be i n c o r r e c t . since the propagation constraints are provably c o r r e c t   the inconsistency can only arise from contradictions i m p l i c i t in the i n f o r mation given to the system. inferno can suggest ways to a l t e r the data so as to make it consistent. such a suggestion  called a r e c t i f i c a t i o n   i d e n t i f i e s one or more assertions whose given 
v a l i d i t y must be reduced and/or i n f e r e n t i a l r e l a tions that must be weakened. inferno can generate the best n of the possible r e c t i f i c a t i o n s   ranking them under the assumption t h a t those involving the least a l t e r a t i o n of the o r i g i n a l data are more l i k e l y to be acceptable. 
1 applying inferno to the model 
　　　when we wished to apply prospector to the model we f i r s t had to reformulate it to conform to prospector's a r c h i t e c t u r a l r e s t r i c t i o n s . inferno does not impose any .such r e s t r i c t i o n s and the mode can be run in i t s o r i g i n a l form. 
       inferno immediately finds the set of assertions to be inconsistent. analysis of the various interdependencies then leads it to propose four a l t e r n a t i v e r e c t i f i c a t i o n s   each of which w i l l correct  a l l inconsistencies. each r e c t i f i c a t i o n consists of a single change: 
reduce the v a l i d i t y of assertion a1 to .1 
	reduce the v a l i d i t y of assertion a1  to 	.1 
reduce the v a l i d i t y of assertion al to .1 
weaken the o n l y - i f strength of assertion a1 to .1 
this analysis is intended to permit the user to review selected fragments of the data w i t h an eye to making it consistent before t r u s t i n g conclusions based on i t . 
　　　let us suppose the user  a f t e r r e f l e c t i o n   decides that assertion al is inapplicable in t h i s case and should be completely disregarded rather than j u s t having a lower v a l i d i t y . the consistent set of p r o b a b i l i t y bounds that inferno obtains from a1 through a1 is shown in table t1. in general it is more d i f f i c u l t to place a c a t e g o r i cal i n t e r p r e t a t i o n on inferno's ranges than it was in the case of prospector's point p r o b a b i l i t i e s   
but in t h i s instance the mapping to  t   f  seems reasonable. notice  though  that the categorical i n t e r p r e t a t i o n again v i o l a t e s a r e l a t i v e l y strong r e l a t i o n  a1  p r e d i c t i n g that stocks w i l l f a l l if there is a high d e f i c i t ! 
　　　to summarize: inferno avoids three of the four d i f f i c u l t i e s t h a t prospector experienced w i t h the model. it allows assertions and inferences 

	j. quinlan 	1 
about l o g i c a l combinations of propositions and is not put out by cycles in the net. it also makes apparent any inconsistencies in the data and provides h e l p f u l aids to reviewing i t . however  an attempt to place c a t e g o r i c a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s on the r e s u l t s can once more lead to conclusions that are not consistent with the data. 
1. ponderosa 
　　　ponderosa represents a departure from current p l a u s i b l e inference systems because  although it s t i l l deals w i t h uncertain assertions and r e l a t i o n s   it docs not attempt to propagate v a l i d i t y measures 
of any k i n d . instead  it follows the approach of t r y i n g to i d e n t i f y i n t e r n a l l y consistent subsets of the information given to i t . the merit of any such d i v i s i o n is then established as a function of the v a l i d i t i e s of assertions that were not included. 
1 description of the approach 
　　　each assertion in the model can be viewed as a well-formed formula  wff  of the propositiona  calculus w i t h a v a l i d i t y measure attached  or  in the case of the   i f and only i f   assertions  a 
p a i r of such formulas. let c be a subset of the w f f s   where we disregard for the moment each w f f ' s v a l i d i t y measure. c is consistent if there is no wff that can be both proved and disproved from c* a subset is maximally consistent if it is consistent but the addition of any other wff from the o r i g i n a l set w i l l make i t i n c o n s i s t e n t . 
　　　suppose now that the o r i g i n a l set of wffs has been divided into a maximally consistent subset c and remainder r = {r1 r1  . . .   rnj and l e t v ri  be the v a l i d i t y measure of r i . one way of assessing the s i t u a t i o n would be to accept the wffs in c together w i t h a l l t h e i r  consistent  inferences and to ignore the wffs in r as being e i t h e r erroneous   e . g .   r e s u l t i n g from f a u l t y observation  or d e f a u l t assertions that do not apply in t h i s case. how plausible is t h i s d i v i s i o n   if it is to be c o r r e c t   each i n d i v i d u a l ri must be incorrect or inapplicable. the p r o b a b i l i t y that t h i s d i v i s i o n is correct is then the p r o b a b i l i t y of the conjunction 

* this notion of consistency is stronger than the one used for inferno in which it is permissible to i n f e r both a and ~a so long as the sum of the upper bounds of p a  and p ~a  does not exceed 1.

of the d i v i s i o n of the o r i g i n a l set of wffs i n t o c and r. 
       the number of p o t e n t i a l s p l i t s of a set of wffs i n t o a maximally consistent subset and a remainder grows exponentially w i t h the size of the set. the v a l i d i t y measures attached to p r o p o s i t i o n s   however  provide methods of reducing the computational load. f i r s t   we are c l e a r l y u n i n terested in any d i v i s i o n whose v a l i d i t y is zero. if any wff in r has a v a l i d i t y of 1  the inequali t y above gives a zero upper bound on the v a l i d i t y of t h a t d i v i s i o n . consequently  we need consider only d i v i s i o n s i n which a l l c a t e g o r i c a l assertions are included in the consistent subset c. second  we do not wish to swamp the user w i t h a l l possible d i v i s i o n s   but rather to generate and display only the best n of them for some small  f i x e d n. 
1 algorithm for finding divisions 
　　　we now give a method for f i n d i n g the best n  maximally consistent subsets of the w f f s . this is necessary to demonstrate t h a t ponderosa's approach is computationally f e a s i b l e   but casual readers might prefer to move d i r e c t l y to section 
1. 
　　　each p r o p o s i t i o n a is broken i n t o two f i n d ings  a is t r u e   and  a is f a l s e   . associated 
w i t h each f i n d i n g is a c o l l e c t i o n of j u s t i f i c a t i o n s f o r the f i n d i n g   where a n u l l 	j u s t i f i c a t i o n indicates t h a t there is no reason to believe the f i n d i n g . 	each j u s t i f i c a t i o n for the f i n d i n g is e i t h e r that the f i n d i n g is an e x p l i c i t assertion given to the system  or t h a t the f i n d i n g is an inference from a r e l a t i o n and one or more other findings with non-null j u s t i f i c a t i o n s . 	for instance  the f i n d i n g  b is f a l s e   and the r e l a t ion  a implies b  together j u s t i f y the f i n d i n g  a is f a l s e     and the l o g i c a l r e l a t i o n  x is the d i s j u n c t i o n of a and b  together with both these findings j u s t i f i e s  x is f a l s e   . 
　　　every datum is e i t h e r a r e l a t i o n or a given f i n d i n g and a l l findings depend u l t i m a t e l y on the 
data. ponderosa keeps w i t h each f i n d i n g a removal plan in the form of a c o l l e c t i o n of sets of data  the idea being t h a t a l l j u s t i f i c a t i o n s for t h i s f i n d i n g would evaporate i f   and only i f   any one of these sets of data were removed. the algorithms below depend on the observation t h a t a removal plan is isomorphic to a l o g i c a l expression in d i s j u n c t i v e normal form. let us map each datum d to the predicate  d is excluded  and the removal plan 
　　　{ { d 1   d 1   . . . }   { d 1   d 1   . . . }  . . . } to the l o g i c a l expression 
　　  d l l is excluded and d1 is excluded and . . .   or  d1 is excluded and d1 is excluded and . . .   or .. . 
then the expression is true i f   and only i f   one of the sets of data making up the removal plan has been discarded  in which case the plan is s a t i s f i e d . 
　　　the computation of removal plans keeps pace with the propagation of inferences. i n i t i a l l y the only f i n d i n g s w i t h j u s t i f i c a t i o n s are those t h a t appear in the data  and the removal plan for such a f i n d i n g is { { i t s e l f } } . suppose now that a new j u s t i f i c a t i o n for f i n d i n g f has been i n f e r r e d from 
a r e l a t i o n r and findings { s i } . this j u s t i f i c a t i o n could be removed if e i t h e r r or any of the s's could be removed  as given by the plan  in d i s j u n c t i v e form  
x = { r} v removal plan sl  v removal plan s1  v . . . 
but previous j u s t i f i c a t i o n s may have been found for f and removal of f would require removal of them as w e l l . in t h i s case  the new removal plan for f becomes the conjunction of the old removal 
plan and x. 
　　　when the data are inconsistent there w i l l be one or more propositions { ai} that can be both proved and disproved  i . e .   one or more pairs of findings  ai is t r u e   and  ai is f a l s e     both w i t h non-null j u s t i f i c a t i o n s and removal plans. clearl y   the data would become consistent i f   and only i f   one of each such p a i r of findings could be 
removed. when put i n t o d i s j u n c t i v e normal form  the removal plan obtained as the conjunction over 
i 	of 
	removal plan 	  ai 	is true   
	v removal plan 	  ai is false   
is then j u s t the set of remainders corresponding to a l l possible maximally consistent sets. 
　　　the f i n a l problem is to f i n d the best d i v i s ions without computing a l l of them. the v a l i d i t y 
of a d i v i s i o n is known only as a range  but d i v isions can be ranked approximately by comparing 
the midpoints of t h e i r ranges. ponderosa computes the o v e r a l l removal plan above in a depthf i r s t fashion so t h a t   if a p a r t i a l remainder is generated t h a t is already more implausible than the best n  complete remainders found so f a r   a l l possible remainders containing the p a r t i a l one are skipped. 
1 applying ponderosa to the model 
　　　as was the case w i t h inferno  ponderosa contains no r e s t r i c t i o n s that would require the model to be reformulated. once again the i n f o r mation in assertions ai through a1 is found to be inconsistent and ponderosa generates the s i x possible d i v i s i o n s of the corresponding w f f s i n t o a maximally consistent subset and a remainder. the six remainders are displayed in table t1 together w i t h the bounds on the v a l i d i t y of the d i v i s i o n s and the midpoints of these ranges. notice t h a t   whereas inferno would accept the weakening o f j u s t  stocks w i l l f a l l   a s s u f f i c i e n t to remedy the inconsistencies  ponderosa uses a stronger d e f i n i t i o n of consistency and f i n d s t h a t removal of assertion ai alone is not enough. 


       ponderosa does not a u t o m a t i c a l l y select the  best  or any other maximally consistent .subset as being c o r r e c t . i t s f u n c t i o n stops w i t h p o i n t i n q out to the user the p o s s i b i l i t i e s t h a t e x i s t for making h i s information c o n s i s t e n t   using the v a l i d i t y rankinq only as a f i l t e r and h e u r i s t i c guide. the u s e r ' s s p e c i a l i s t knowledge may place a value on various subsets of the i n f o r m a t i o n t h a t d i f f e r s from t h i s simple p l a u s i b i l i t y model. i n t h i s instance  l e t us suppose that  the f o u r t h remainder  assertions al and alo  is selected as the least  valuable of the s i x . when these a s s e r t ions are deleted  we have a maximally c o n s i s t e n t subset of the data whose i m p l i c a t i o n s for the f i v e i n d i c a t o r s appear in table t1. 

       this paper has focused on a class of p l a u s i b l e reasoning tasks w i t h three c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s : incons i s t e n t d a t a   n o n - h i e r a r c h i c a l i n t e r a c t i o n o f concepts  and the need to o b t a i n simultaneous readings on several hypotheses. a simple model w i t h these a t t r i b u t e s was used to demonstrate t h a t e x i s t i n g systems f o r inexact inference are not s u i t e d to t h i s kind of task. we f i r s t examined prospector as the q u i n t e s s e n t i a l example of a 
bayesian system and showed t h a t both the model and prospector i t s e l f would have to be a l t e r e d to get any r e s u l t s at a l l . even then  the inconsistency inherent in the given model was not made evident and a s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the results turned out to be at variance w i t h the model. inferno  a more t o l e r a n t non-bayesian system  fared b e t t e r in t h a t the model d i d not have to be 
	j. quinlan 	1 
changed and i t s i n c o n s i s t e n c i e s were discovered  but once more the attempt to wring a c a t e g o r i c a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n from the r e s u l t s produced an anomaly. ponderosa was introduced as a system to perform uncertain inference by f i n d i n g maximal c o n s i s t e n t subsets of the model  leading to r e s u l t s t h a t are always c a t e g o r i c a l and t h a t agree 
w i t h whatever reduced model is used. 
       there are c l e a r l y other classes of p l a u s i b l e reasoning tasks to which ponderosa is u n s u i t e d . if a l l the data is c o n s i s t e n t or if there is a s i n g l e p r o p o s i t i o n about which information is sought  the p r o b a b i l i t y - b o u n d i n g approach of inferno gives a b e t t e r a p p r a i s a l of the confidence w i t h which the r e s u l t s can be accepted. this suggests an i n t e r e s t i n g p o s s i b i l i t y for combining the t a l e n t s of ponderosa and inferno. f i r s t   ponderosa would be used to f i n d whether the data i s c a t e g o r i c a l l y consistent and  i f n o t   t o help the user choose a maximally c o n s i s t e n t subset of i t . inferno could then be run w i t h t h i s subset to supplement ponderosa's c a t e g o r i c a l inferences w i t h p r o b a b i l i t y bounds. for instance  in the previous section we selected a maximally c o n s i s t e n t subset a1 through a1 of the assertions in table t l . the analysis of t h i s subset w i t h inferno is shown in table tg. it now becomes apparent t h a t   while c a t e g o r i c a l inferences from the subset j u s t i f y both the p r e d i c t i o n s that bonds w i l l r i s e and that there w i l l be a high d e f i c i t   the former c o n c l u sion has weaker p r o b a b i l i t y bounds as a consequence o f i t s d e r i v a t i o n from less v a l i d a s s e r t i o n s . 

       ponderosa has been implemented in pascal and c f o r a vax 1 minicomputer  based on a s i m i l a r implementation of inferno. the prototype 
has been applied only to small tasks w i t h less than 1 r e l a t i o n s and p r o p o s i t i o n s   and on these it is f a s t enough to be u s e f u l but considerably slower than inferno. for comparison  where inferno required j u s t over a second to run the model  i n c l u d i n g f i n d i n g r e c t i f i c a t i o n s   ponderosa 
needed about 1 seconds.
