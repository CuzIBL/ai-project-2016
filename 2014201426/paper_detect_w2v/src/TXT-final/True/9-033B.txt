　　　the paper deals with the problem of cont r o l algorithm synthesis f o r a six-legged walker. it is supposed that the walker is supplied with an onboard d i g i t a l computer. rather a complicated algorithm may be used  which provides walking over rough t e r r a i n and climbing over some isolated obstacles. lt is also supposed that the walker is equipped with a measurement system giving i n f o r m a t i on about the t e r r a i n r e l i e f . measurement data are processed by dc and used when making decision. 
　　　an effective method of testing the a l gorithms is t h e i r simulation on a d i g i t a l computer w i t h a display u n i t . it is possible to simulate the walker i t s e l f   t e r r a i n r e l i e f   measurement system functioning! data processing  decision making and walker cont r o l l i n g . observing on the crt screen the moving image of the vehicle walking over the t e r r a i n   it is possible to check the f u n c t i oning of the algorithms  to estimate t h e i r effectiveness and to f i n d ways f o r t h e i r im-

　　　this paper deals with the algorithms in the range from the environment information 
 input  to the vehicle kinematics  output .. the problem of t e r r a i n measurement data p r o cessing and measurement c o n t r o l l i n g are also investigated. the simulation results are discussed. 
　　　on the f i r s t stage of the control algorithm synthesis it was assumed that a l l necessary information about the t e r r a i n r e l i e f was got and processed and was kept in the computer memory in the form convenient f o r i t s f u r t h e r use in the decision-making algor i t h m . 
　　　several types of six-legged walking system were investigated. schematic image of one of them is seen in pig. i. a l l six legs of the walker have equal geometrical parameters and equal orientation of the j o i n t axes. each leg has three degrees of freedom in the j o i n t s : two in the hip j o i n t and one in the knee. the f i r s t hip-joint axis is perpendicular to the plane of the vehicle body  while the second one is p a r a l l e l to the body plane and perpendicular to the 
t h i g h . the knee axis is p a r a l l e l to the second h i p - j o i n t axis. the t o t a l number of degrees of freedom in six legs amounts to eighteen. the vehicle body has no kinematic cons t r a i n t s   and therefore it may have six degrees of freedom in i t s motion relative to the supporting surface. 
　　　the walker of t h i s type has rather r i c h kinematic f e a s i b i l i t i e s which may be used to provide the vehicle's adaptivity to the t e r r a i n . the problem is to synthesize appropriate control algorithms which  could organize the walker kinematic in a reasonable way f o r the effective solving of different locomotion tasks. 
　　　it was reasonable to design control a l gorithms as a multilevel hierarchical system. the following 1 levels were adopted: 
　　　1. leg. this level is the lowest one.it is necessary to synthesize leg motion during the support and swing phases and to avoid small-size obstacles. 
　　　1. leg coordination. this level is higher than the previous one. the leg-coordination algorithms provide support scheduling of the legs  i . e . they generate sequences of  up  and  down  times f o r a l l legs. the cond i t i o n must be s a t i s f i e d : the s t a b i l i t y margin of the vehicle should be always no less 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　1 than a given value.
　　　1. standpoint sequence. this l e v e l fixes in advance several supporting points on the support surface. in a simple case  if the t e r r a i n r e l i e f allows i t   the level generates a regular standpoint sequence described by two parameters: the gauge width and the s t r i d e length. in more complicated cases it is necessary to plan an irregular standpoint sequence  e.g. for some cases of climbing over obstacles. 
　　　1. body. the output of t h i s level is the parameters of motion of the walker's centre of mass both along the route and in v e r t i c a l d i r e c t i o n   and the parameters of body r o t a t i on   p i t c h   jaw  r o l l   . 
　　　1. route. the route planning level is the highest one. up to now the route of the walker has been planned by an operator. 
　　　pig. 1 shows i n t e r l e v e l information flow. the complex of control algorithms is dashl i n e d . dotted lines indicate the flow of t e r -
r a i n information to different levels. 
　　　it was reasonable to begin designing the algorithms from lower levels and then 
pass on to the higher ones. when testing the algorithms the outputs of higher levels were imitated. 
　　　the i n i t i a l stage of investigation dealt with the leg-control algorithm in the simple case of regular gait of the walker moving 
along the regular standpoint sequence. the 
1 body moved with constant v e l o c i t y . the i m i t a t i o n of the levels higher to the leg-cont r o l l e v e l was  in t h i s case  rather simple. 
the leg-control algorithm provided vertical legs adaptation to small-scale terrain rough-
ness. 
　　　a special block was designed for synthesizing leg-tip motion during the swing phase in the case of complicated small-scale rel i e f . the ordinates of the leg-tip trajectory  fig. 1  were calculated as the sum of the ordinates of the convex envelope of the relief  dashed line in fig. 1  and of the ordinates of a parabola with vertical axis. the parabola was chosen in such a way that itb ordinates were equal to zero both in the i n i t i a l and final points. it was assumed that the horizontal component of the leg-tip velocity was constant during the whole swing phase. 
　　　for the second level of leg coordination - the algorithm for support scheduling with prescribed stability margin was designed in a general case for irregular standpoint sequence . 
two types of gait were investigated: 
　　　1. tripod gait. each of the two tripods consists of foreleg and hind leg of one size 
and of middle leg of another size. three legs of the tripod swing simultaneously.two tripods swing alternately. fig. 1a i l l u strates the adopted logics of calculating  up  and  down  times of the tripod in the case when a l l legs of the same side use the same standpoint sequence   step-in-step  
type of locomotion . the swing phase of the tripod coincides with the time interval when the projection of the centre of mass of the walker moves between two dashed lines inside the supporting triangle formed by the legs of the other tripod  fig. 1a . this logics provides stability margin of prescribed value. 
　　　1. wave gait.1 the idea of this type of gait was taken from one of the enthomological papers by d. wilson.1 the swing waves propagate along the legs of each side of the walker beginning from the hind legs. the hind legs of both sides start alternately. 
　　　support scheduling logics is shown in fig. 1b  the time interval between the start of the hind leg and the standing of the foreleg  wave propagation time  was calculated under condition of prescribed stability margin. two equal intervals of simultaneous support of hind and middle legs  and of middle and front legs were subtracted from the wave propagation time. the rest of the time was devided among three legs proportional to their strides  the rule of constant legtip horizontal velocity. 
　　　it should be noted that in special case of regular standpoint sequence the gaits generated both by wave and by tripod algorithms may coincide. but in. general case of irregular standpoint sequence algorithms synthesize different gaits. 
　　　the designed algorithms of this level generated support schedule for both constant and variable velocity of the body in general case of curve route. the body rotation and the vertical component of body velocity might be taken into consideration. 
　　　on the third level two versions of standpoint planning algorithms were designed which were able to generate standpoint sequences for arbitrary curve route on the support surface with small-scale roughness. it was assumed that each point of the surface might be used as a standpoint. 
　　　some algorithms were designed for generating special irregular standpoint sequences in case of overcoming obstacles. 
　　　the fourth-level algorithms formed body motion for curve route under the above mentioned condition relative to the support surface. some cased of overcoming obstacles 
were considered. 
　　　fig. 1 presents an example of the walker's locomotion along the curve route. the 
vehicle moved at f i r s t along the rectilinear segment ab. then  at point b  it changed i t s route and began walking along the circle of the prescribed radius around the object located inside the circle  part bob . at point 
b the walker continued i t s previous route  segment bd . 
　　　the problem of overcoming isolated obstacles of some types was investigated. an obstacle may be considered as an isolated one when it is located on the support sur-
face a l l points of which might be used as standpoints. for some obstacles it appears 
undesirable or impossible to use points of the support surface in the vicinity of the obstacle due to geometrical restrictions associated with the neighbourhood of the obstacle. 
　　　some types of isolated obstacles are shown in fig. 1. one-parameter obstacle  cleft   fig. 1a  is functionally equivalent to the domain forbidden for standing the legs. there are no geometrical restrictions in the vicinity of the  cleft . 
　　　two-parameter obstacle  boulder   fig. 1b   on the contrary  creates two restricted spots close to i t . the spot before the boulder is undesirable because of the possibility of contacting the boulder in the support 
phase. the body of the boulder may make it impossible to stand leg tip in the spot be-
hind the obstacle. it is permissible to stand legs of the walker on the boulder; it is even desirable. 
　　　the bottom of the three-parameter obstacle  pit   fig. 1c  may be used to stand legs on it except two spots near the walls. 
1 　　　it should be noted that  cleft    boulder  and  pit  from the geometrical point of view may be regarded as a combination of more simple obstacles of the types  stepi n   and  step-down   fig. 1d  e . if the longitudinal dimensions of the upper part of the boulder or these of the p i t bottom are large enough  the boulder and the pit may be interpreted as two separate isolated obstacles of the  step  type. if the  steps  are positioned rather close one after another  there exists interference between them  and it is  apparently  more reasonable to treat such a combination as a special type of obstacle with i t s own special method of overcoming. 
　　　some algorithms were designed for decision-making concerning the reasonable a c t i ons of the walker overcoming the obstacle. it was assumed that a l l necessary information about the type and geometrical parameters of the obstacle are available and may be used by decision-making algorithm. 
　　　as to the methods of overcoming obstacles  the basic principle was assumed that the higher level might be involved only in case of real need. for instance  if adaptation to email scale obstacles can be made by means of level  leg   this must be done. if this appears impossible  the special standpoint sequence and appropriate support schedule must be generated. if necessary  the special body motion has to be used. 
　　　the algorithms for overcoming the clefttype obstacle were designed in greater details a special classification block estimated the 
　　　it was assumed that the measurement system was able to estimate the distance between the fixed point of the vehicle and the point of intersection of the measuring beam and the support surface. the direction of the beam 
may be constant. when the vehicle walkes  the beam slides over the terrain and measures i t s profile. but this may be insufficient. the angle between the beam and horizon must be small enough for the vehicle could get terrain relief information beforehand and has possibility of planning its actions in a reasonable way. on the other hand  it is clear that for small beam-horizon angle rather long zones after obstacles are inaccessible to relief measurements. the increasing of the 
beam-horizon angle diminishes the inaccessible zones but diminishes simultaneously the distance between the vehicle and the measured points of the terrain. 
　　　
situation: standpoint sequence parameters  cleft width and i t s position relative to the walker. depending on the situation analysis results the following decisions about the regime could be made: 
　　　1. nothing has to be changes. 
　　　1. it is necessary to make longer one stride before the cleft by changing the position of two standpoints and shifting them in such a way that one of them  the nearest to the cleft  would be positioned on the brink. the further development of standpoint 
sequence may be regular  as before the cleft. 
　　　1. it is necessary to position four standpoints on the brinks of the cleft  two on each brink  and to rearrange some other standpoints. 
　　　1. to apply regime 1 but to shift standpoints on the brink closer to the axis of the standpoint sequence. 
　　　1. the body of the walker must be lowered  and regime 1 must be applied. 
　　　the standpoint sequences in fig. 1 correspond to regime 1  while those in fig. 1 correspond to regimes 1 and 1. 
　　　the regimes 1 are listed in order of growth of their complicacy and their feasib i l i t i e s . according to the basic principle the classification block tried to find out subsequently the possibility to use regimes 1  beginning from regime i  and adopted the f i r s t of them which provided successful overcoming the cleft. 
　　　such an approach is evidently applicable to designing reasonable methods of overcoming other types of obstacles. it should be noted that for a pit rather deep  or for a boulder rather high  or for an obstacle like the one in fig. 1 it may be necessary to t i l t the body of the walker and change i t s pitch angle in an appropriate way as a function of time  fig. 1  1 . it is evident that when analysing the obstacle  this regime  as the most complicated one  has to be tested in the last turn. 
　　　some problems connected with measurements were investigated: measurement data processing  obstacle identification  measurement control. 
　　　under the circumstances it was reasonable to control the beam direction for more effective use of measurement system. one of the adopted rules was as follows. all the time when it is possible  some  small  beamhorizon constant angle is used. this regime is used as long as the size of inaccessible zones is no more than a given value and each zone can be  overstepped   i.e. overcomed without placing any standpoint inside the zone. if not  the additional measurements must be carried out when approaching nearer to the obstacle. the measuring beam must be inclined steeper to horizon. 
　　　if measuring results indicate that it is impossible to place standpoints inside the zone after the obstacle in an appropriate way  the further locomotion is excluded. if appropriate placing the standpoints is possible  the walker uses these points for standing i t s legs and walks on. 
　　　the investigation carried out confirmed that observing on the display screen the moving image of the vehicle walking on the terrain is a very effective method for testing the control algorithms and estimating their properties. the motion picture made from the crt screen of the display unit gives an idea of the walker control algorithms effectiveness.
