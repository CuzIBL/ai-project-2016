       isaac-1  	a 	program 	which 	solves 	physics problems stated in english  w i l l 	be denonstrated in real t i n e . 	a notebook of problens which have 	been solved 	by 	the 	progran 	w i l l 	be 	displayed; 	the denonstration w i l l 	include problens 	taken from t h i s s e t . 	in 	a d d i t i o n   	new 	problems 	in 	elenentary physics  stated 	e n t i r e l y 	in 	e n g l i s h   	i . e .   	not 
requiring a diagram as part of the problen statenent  contributed by conference attendees w i l l be accepted  and w i l l be attenpted by the progran. 
       this program  a successor to our e a r l i e r isaac program  	f i r s t 	parses the sentences of the problen statenent to b u i l d an i n t e r n a l nodel of the objects in 	the problen and t h e i r r e l a t i o n s h i p s ; 	t h i s nodel is stated in terns 	of 	real-world 	objects 	 cars  people  	e t c .   . 	using 	rules 	which 	exanlne q u a l i t a t i v e and q u a n t i t a t i v e 	features 	of 	objects and 	r e l a t i o n s h i p s   	the 	progran 	chooses views of objects  or groups of objects  as physical 	systems   e . g .   	  r i g i d 	body  or   u n i f o r n acceleration fron r e s t     . 	this set of nodels gives rise to a set 	of 
equations which can be solved to find the answer to the problen. the internal nodel of the objects is 
also used to generate a picture of the problen; an exanple of such a picture  generated by isaac  is shown in figure 1 . 
       the major difference between t h i s progran 	and isaac 	l i e s 	 n 	the 	choice 	of 	problem 	solving methods. 	isaac could solve only r i g i d body s t a t i c s problens 	 which 	limited 	the 	range 	of 	s o l u t i o n methods needed ; 	it also wrote a 	large 	nunber 	of equations 	which 	were 	solved 	by 	brute 	force. isaac-1 has a larger r e p e r t o i r e of problen solving methods  even for the  sane  type of problen ; 	t h i s enables 	it 	to 	select 	the 	best 	nethod 	for 	a p a r t i c u l a r 	problem. 	the 	resulting solutions are less conplex a l g e b r a i c a l l y   and are closer 	to 	the solutions produced by hunan experts. 
       physics 	problen 	solving 	is 	an 	inportant research 	area 	because 	the 	techniques 	used 	for solving physics problens  when f u l l y developed  can aid 	teaching 	of 	physics 	and 	can 	be 	used 	for i n t e l l i g e n t 	conput er-aided engineering analysis and 
design. 
this 	research 	was 	supported 	by 	nsf 	award 	no. sed-1 	in 	the 	joint 	national 	i n s t i t u t e of
