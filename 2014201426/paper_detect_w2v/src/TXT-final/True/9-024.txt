 
　　　this paper presents and discusses examples of mechanical inference problems which must be solved in order to construct effective mechanical speech understanding systems. the examples are taken from incremental simulations of a prototype speech understanding system which w i l l use syntactic  semantic  and pragmatic information as well as acoustical and phonological information to mechanically  understand  continuous speech utterances. 
introduction 
　　　in experiments in spectrogram reading  the performance obtained by human experts for phonetic segmentation and labeling without conscious appeal to syntactic  semantic  or vocabulary constraints was: approximately 1% of the segments correctly labeled  with either a complete or a p a r t i a l phonetic specification   1% mislabeled  and 1% segments missed. the fact that human experts with years of experience in looking at spectrograms and a detailed understanding of the acoustic characteristics of speech sounds find it impossible to uniquely decide which of several possible phonemes are present in a given segment of speech signal  and the fact that they make a significant number of errors in both segmenting the signal into phonetic units and in the labeling of these units  make it unlikely that any mechanical acoustical processing component w i l l be able to segment and label continuous speech signals with very high r e l i a b i l i t y using only acoustic information. moreover  it is l i k e l y that this indeterminacy in the acoustic domain is a fundamental property of human speech and not just an inadequacy in the analyzer. 
　　　however  in the same experiments  when the spectrogram reader used syntactic  semantic  and vocabulary constraints to attempt to identify the words in the sentences  using a computerized word r e t r i e v a l routine which f a c i l i t a t e d the vocabulary searches  the success rate for word i d e n t i f i c a t i o n was 1. there is hope therefore that with the proper use of syntactic  semantic  and vocabulary constraints one could build a system to understand continuous speech at a comparable level even though the acoustic segmenter and labeler operates with a significant error rate. of course  in both the i n i t i a l segmentation and labeling and in the subsequent application of syntactic and semantic constraints  the attainment with a mechanical algorithm of performance comparable 
to that of a human is no small task. 
the bbn speech project 
　　　the speech project at bolt beranek and newman  1 1  is endeavoring to construct a computer system which approaches the performance of human spectrogram readers at deciphering the meaning of continuous spoken sentences. the task of this system w i l l be to  understand  spoken sentences and take appropriate actions. note that this task does not include producing an accurate phonetic transcription of the input or even necessarily an accurate l i s t of the successive words of the input  although it would be hard to imagine it getting the appropriate action if it did not in fact identify most of the words . what we are emphasizing here is that in a situation in which the acoustics is unable to resolve the decision between two phonemes or between two words at some point in the sentence  but the remaining components are able to decide the meaning of the sentence in any case  e.g. the meaning is the same regardless of which phoneme or word is chosen   then the sentence w i l l be deemed to have been correctly understood. it is this difference between what is required for a correct output that distinguishes what the members of the arpa speech project  have been calling  speech understanding  from the more t r a d i t i o n a l  speech recognition . 
1 　　　by examining the teletype protocols of the klatt and stevens experiment   1     we were able to gather considerable information about the problem solving processes and strategies which those researchers used to untangle the meanings of spectrograms. on the basis of these protocols one can conceptually decompose the speech understanding process into a number of components or routines corresponding to different types of knowledge and inference techniques applied. these components included  1  extract  the routine which performs the phonetic segmentation and labeling of the acoustic signal  both segmenting and labeling are intimately cross connected    1  lexret  a l e x i c a l r e t r i e v a l routine which recovers possible words from the vocabulary on the basis of p a r t i a l phonetic information  this component was machine implemented in the klatt and stevens experiment    1  match  a routine which compares a given candidate word against the speech signal at a given point and determines the quality of the match  this component is intended to include the use of phonological and acoustic-phonetic rules for characterizing the changes which phonemes may undergo in specific sentential environments    1  syntax  a component which makes judgements of syntactic acceptability of sequences of words and may also propose words on the basis of syntactic context {this component may eventually also correlate the prosodies of the speech signal with the syntactic structure of the sentence    1  semantics  a component for judging the semantic acceptability of a p a r t i a l utterance and for proposing words semantically motivated by context  and  1  pragmatics  a component which encompasses that knowledge which one has about the immediate context of the dialog that is not part of his general syntactic and semantic information  such information includes knowledge concerning the user  the user's state  the context of the dialogue  e t c .   . a l l of these six components are k n i t together by some governing problem solving strategy which we w i l l identify as a separate component and c a l l control. 
incremental simulation 
　　　in the klatt and stevens experiment   1     the lexret component was implemented in a computer and a l l of the other components resided in the head of the human spectrogram reader. the teletype protocol  which constitutes a record of the information exchange between the lexret component and control  was very informative but l e f t many questions unanswered. for example  it was d i f f i c u l t to t e l l where in the spectrogram the person was looking  one had to deduce it from the phonetic information that he was giving lexret   and one could not t e l l when and where the experimenter was performing match with words that were not returned by lexret  for example  small function words were almos t always proposed and matched without using lexret . this suggested a design methodology which we have been using to gather information about speech understanding problems and to construct a prototype system. the method  which we have been calling  incremental simulation   consists of f i l l i n g the roles of the different components of the system p a r t i a l l y with humans and p a r t i a l l y with computer programs and attempting to understand spectrograms while keeping protocols of the information exchanged between components. 
　　　a human f i l l i n g the role of the control component  for example  would be attempting to devise a strategy to use the information from the other components to effectively  understand  spectrograms. as he finds certain functions that he performs becoming mechanical and boring  he writes computer programs to perform them and in this way gradually replaces himself with a computer program. he may then monitor the behavior of t h i s component and make modifications as he sees f i t . humans f i l l i n g the roles of other components perform the same functions simultaneously attempting to help the overall understanding process by giving the best information they can  trying to formulate algorithms which w i l l generate similar performance  and simulating these algorithms to assess their performance. 
　　　the incremental simulation approach has the advantage that one can quickly obtain a feeling for some of the d i f f i c u l t problems without having to wait for a complex overall system to be b u i l t and then discovering a f a t a l flaw in the system design. in this paper  we would like to share with you some of the examples of inference problems which we have encountered as the result of such simulations. 
restricting the scope 
　　　both for the i n i t i a l phonetic analysis and for the subsequent linguistic processing  matching the performance of a human in the task of speech understanding requires a great deal of specific knowledge -- knowledge of the behavior of speech sounds  of syntactic constructions and of the semantic relationships between words. human beings spend something like the f i r s t six years of their lives approximately one half time at the task of learning this information  and the updating and refining of it goes on a l l their l i v e s . moreover  this learning is mostly at a subconscious level and one is not aware of what he  knows  in these areas. for example  any layman can t e l l you when a sample of synthesized speech sounds unnatural  but he  cannot  and in many cases a linguist or speech scientist cannot either  t e l l you what rule or regularity of speech is being violated. 
　　　since the present state of knowledge in the areas of acoustic-phonetics  phonology  syntax  and semantics is far from complete  it is necessary to r e s t r i c t our scope to some extent in order to l i m i t the amount of knowledge that we require. in the areas of syntax and semantics  language understanding projects have achieved such limitations by r e s t r i c t i n g attention to particular data bases about which questions w i l l be asked. this results in a restricted vocabulary  a restricted set of meanings for the words and some small r e s t r i c t i o n on the range of english constructions that one might use. in the bbn speech project we have achieved such a r e s t r i c t i o n by focusing on an existing natural language question-answering system in which the syntax and semantics have already been formalized - the lunar sciences natural language information system  hereafter referred to as lunar. this is a system in which a lunar geologist can type english questions such as  what is the average concentration of rubidium in high-alkali rocks   and receive an answer computed from a data base of chemical analyses for the apollo 1 lunar rock samples. the choice of this system as a vehicle for speech understanding research has a number of advantages aside from the fact that the system already existed. among other things it contains a large and interesting vocabulary and an extensive grammar.

　　　to give you a flavor of what an incremental simulation involves and also to begin our exposition of inference problems encountered  l e t us follow through the steps of an abbreviated version of a simulation. in this simulation  extract has been manually done o f f - l i n e   lexret and a very crude match component are implemented in the machine  and syntax  semantics  pragmatics  and control

f i g u r e 1. 	computer phonetic representations 
simulation 
　　　to begin our simulation we extract a sequence of p a r t i a l phonetic descriptions of length 1 at the beginning of the sentence by calling sx and we then retrieve words matching this sequence by calling rx. the computer 
protocol i s : 

we 	get 	back 	three 	words  	 less   	  l i s t     
 was   of which the second two sound good to us  pragmatically   as words which might start a sentence in the lunar geology application. the word  less  is syntactically possible for a declarative sentence  but the sentences that geologists are expected to say to lunar are either questions or imperatives. he proceed to match the two favored words for acoustic match quality by calling mx  and add the two words to lextable by calling addword: 

the two matches for  was  are due to two different phonetic spellings for the word in the dictionary. 
　　　between the two words   l i s t   and  was  we favor the f i r s t for a number of reasons  tm  it is a longer match and therefore less l i k e l y to be an accident and   l i s t   is one of the most frequent words that begin sentences in the lunar geology application  along with  give  and  what  . also  the geologist is less l i k e l y to ask a question in the past tense. we therefore begin working under the assumption that the f i r s t word is   l i s t     and we look for words that start at 1 next: 


the multiple matches here are due to different phonetic spellings and to the alternatives of skipping or not skipping optional segments in the output from extract. the t h i r d match of  potassium  is pretty good and potassium is also good semantically. none of the 
 titanium  matches are inspiring. in the original simulation we also matched  paper  and  that . the  paper  match was not too bad and the  that  match was exact  but the  potassium  match was such a long one and so good semantically that it was preferred. 
　　　since we are working on the assumption that the f i r s t word is   l i s t     we expect the beginning of a noun phrase after it   and therefore english determiners are l i k e l y words to occur. at this point  the syntactic component is capable of predicting determiners as possible next words and so we try a match of the syntactically proposed word  the . this word was not retrieved by rx  as  that  was  since it contains fewer than 1 phonemes. the small function words  such as  the   are the most ambiguous words to recognize since they are so short that the probability of accidental match is high and also because they are seldom stressed and are usually very much reduced in their pronunciation. the a b i l i t y of the syntactic component to predict the places where they might occur is an important source of information to tap. the word  the  matches and is added to lextable  but the  potassium  match is favored and we pursue that alternative.  here and elsewhere we w i l l omit the actual computer printout for 
brevity.  
　　　since the  potassium  match ended at 1  we begin looking for the next word at 1 and find only  rubidium  which matches perfectly as follows  two phonetic spellings both match : 
1-mx  rubidium  
1:  1 1 1 1 . 1  
1:  1 1 1 1 . 1  
the perfection and the uniqueness of this match convince us that we are on the right track and confirm our belief that the previous 
word was  potassium   and not  the  for example . one version of this simulation was done in front of an audience of kibitzers who at this point were trying to figure out how one could syntactically have two words such as  potassium  and  rubidium  in a row. they concluded that it might be a conjoined l i s t of the form  a  b  and c  and so they proposed  syntactically   the word  and  at this point. the match unfortunately was unsuccessful. 
　　　for those familiar with the lunar system  this pair of words together suggested an entirely different next word  semantically!  since the potassium/rubidium r a t i o is one of the standard correlates of age for the lunar samples. thus the next word could have been predicted semantically  although in this simulation it was discovered by lexret with the following match: 

　　　whenever one has just recognized a noun or a verb which can undergo regular i n f l e c t i o n by s u f f i x a t i o n   it is appropriate to look for such suffixes. in this case  since there was no determiner on the noun phrase   the syntactic component should predict that the noun be p l u r a l . we successfully match  -s  at position 1 and we add   r a t i o s   to lextable from 1 to 1. 
　　　again  we are now in a context where the syntactic component can predict small function words - in this case prepositions modifying the noun. also  from semantics  we know that one computes potassium/rubidium ratios in  or for or of  etc.  samples. thus syntax can 
predict a preposition  and given t h i s   semantics can predict which ones. one way to take advantage of this is to c a l l sx for 
pattern sequences of length 1 and then scan the results of rx for small prepositions. this retrieves the word  for  with the following matchest 

the word  for  satisfies our prediction well but the match quality  the f i f t h one is best  is not especially great. we therefore follow out our prediction a l i t t l e further  before adding  for  to the table  by predicting  semantically!  the word  sample : 

the perfection of this match confirms our hypothesis and we add both  for  and  sample  to lextable. again we check for plural endings and again syntax could predict a plural from the absence of a determiner. this results in adding  samples  to lextable from 1 to 1. 
　　　the sentence now seems to read   l i s t potassium/rubidium ratios for samples . . .     and we are now looking at position 1 where we find the words  data     t h a t     and  not . the word  data  looks impossible and  not  looks unlikely  but  that  looks very good  syntactically!  as the beginning of a r e l a t i v e clause. we f i n d that it matches ending at 1  so we add it to lextable and begin at position 1 where we find a perfect match for  contain  ending at 1  among 1 words returned by rx . the verb  contain  looks good as the verb of the relative clause  especially since semantics knows that samples can contain minerals and elements  etc. i t s match quality is excellent  and in our enthusiasm for the current path we don't even look at the others. 
　　　at this point in one simulation  a member of the audience who had had some experience with the lunar system took a wild stab and predicted  pragmatically!  the word   o l i v i n e     the name of a mineral. the match however was unsuccessful. we begin looking for the next word in the usual way but f i n d no words retrieved by rx. we t r y again with r1x  one way of finding shorter words  with the following r e s u l t : 

aha! the verb is i n f l e c t e d   so we t r y the two i n f l e c t i o n a l endings  both of which match ending at 1. the verb must then be either  contained  or  containing . the ending  -ed  is consistent with our current hypothesis and 
we look now at position 1: 

sulfide  which started out r i g h t is obviously not the r i g h t word  but there are no other words retrieved. the match of everything else up to this point has been very good  so we are reluctant to back up to other p o s s i b i l i t i e s . it is possible that there is an acoustic labeling error in these f i r s t three segments. one way to check is to move r i g h t and s t a r t doing  unanchored  matches using rix.  notice that semantics can t e l l us to look for a 
mineral  a chemical element  an isotope  etc.  we find nothing particular using 1 segments at 1  but using 1 segments at 1 we get: 

silicon f i t s beautifully and shows us that the second segment was mislabeled. also we are at the end of the sentence  so we p r i n t out lextable  in real simulations one does this often to see what he has found out so f a r   : 

　　　it looks l i k e the sentence is  list potassium/rubidium ratios for samples that contained s i l i c o n   . everybody in the audience was happy. however  that was not the correct analysis  and there are several morals to be gleaned from this example. recall that at position 1 the word  that  looked so good as the beginning of a relative clause that we didn*t even match  data  or  not . at that point syntax could have told us that  not  could begin a reduced relative clause  especially if the next word were the -ing form of a verb  but reduced relative clauses are relatively rare and lunar's grammar postpones looking for them u n t i l it has tried other things. when one simulator f i r s t analyzed this sentence  he associated a l l of this information with the rejected word  not  and when the i n f l e c t i o n  -ing  occurred at position 1  he revised his opinion of  not  and made it an equal competitor with  that . the analog for a computer program would be to suspend a process with a  demon  looking for an   - i n g   verb. 
　　　when we look  we find that  not  matches perfectly ending at 1  so another possible reading for the sentence is  list potassium/rubidium ratios for samples not containing s i l i c o n   . we have to decide between these two alternatives. note that in this example we happen to have two competing interpretations with exactly opposite meanings! 
　　　it turns out that there are a number of grounds on which one can base the choice between these two readings. they i l l u s t r a t e the kinds of redundancy that are available to resolve such ambiguities if we have the appropriate inference devices. f i r s t   pragmatically  it is unlikely that a geologist talking to lunar would have referred to a sample containing s i l i c o n in the past tense unless both he and the system had reason to believe that the sample no longer existed  and the data base of lunar doesn't know about such things . in fact  the same member of the audience who guessed olivine at position 1 raised this objection to the f i r s t analysis before it was pointed out that the second analysis was possible. so for pragmatic reasons alone we would favor the second analysis  even enough to go looking for it when it had not yet been detected . 
　　　if one had not resolved the ambiguity on pragmatic grounds  one could also have done it on phonological grounds. when combining the i n f l e c t i o n a l endings such as  -ed  with verbs such as  contain   there are phonological constraints which determine how the  -ed  ending w i l l sound. in our phonetic dictionary  -ed  has two spellings:  d  and  ax d . in the above simulation  on closer inspection one can t e l l that the spelling which matched was the second  corresponding to the three syllable pronunciation  con-tain-ed  rather than the correct  con-tained . thus  by using such phonological rules when matching proposed inflected forms  we could have ruled out  contained  in favor of  containing . 
　　　finally  we could have resolved the ambiguity acoustically by calling a variant of the match component to give relative scores to the competing word pairs  not / that  or   - e d   /   - i n g     when the person who had simulated the o f f - l i n e extract was asked 
whether the word at 1 looked more l i k e  that  or  not   he said definitely  not . thus  one could have resolved the differences by having an acoustic  word ambiguity resolver  which given two  or more  words tries to determine which is the best match. this could be done for example by refining the match component and taking the word with the best match score. discussion 
　　　the preceding sample simulation  while it gives a good impression of some of the situations encountered in continuous speech understanding  is untypical in several respects. f i r s t   the acoustic segmentation and labeling on which this simulation is based is unusually good and the branching of alternative possibilities is unusually narrow. that i s   the remarkable degree to which syntactic and semantic intuitions led us directly along the r i g h t path without extensive blind alleys in this simulation is unusual. also  there were no segmentation errors   i . e . no missing segments . a l l of the questionable segments had been labeled as optional by the segmenter and therefore the lexret and match components did not have to cope with segmentation errors. other sentences that we have simulated have contained such errors  and more powerful word r e t r i e v a l and match components have been developed to deal with them. 
　　　a situation that has occurred often in simulations is that rather than receiving a l i s t of words to choose from as a result of a c a l l to lexret  one finds no words at a l l . we encountered one such situation in the sample simulation due to the labeling error at position 1 and we recovered the word by doing unanchored matches further to the r i g h t . however  if the input signal had been more severely garbled so that the resulting match did not look so good or if the rest of the words in the sentence had not matched so w e l l   we would not have been so easily able to choose between this path and the p o s s i b i l i t y that one of the previous word matches was incorrect and some other word match at some previous point might have lead to a better t o t a l match. when one finds a position at which lexret finds no word matches at a l l   then either it is a position where no words are   i . e . the previous word which ends there is an accidental match  or else there are some segmentation or labeling errors that are blocking a word match  this of course assumes that the utterance does not contain a word that is not in the system's lexicon . in the former case  one should reject the accidental match and look elsewhere for the correct word sequence  while in the l a t t e r case  one might recall the extract component to relax or revise i t s previous description of that portion of the sentence or he might try a more desperate version of lexret and match which can compensate for gross errors in the acoustics. another p o s s i b i l i t y in the second case is to c a l l match with a l l of the conceivable words that could be predicted for that position by syntactic and semantic context. 
　　　in the sample simulation  we had active at every step of the analysis   u n t i l the postscript match of  not   a single  theory   or hypothesis  about what the sequence of words in the utterance was and what the syntactic and semantic structure of the utterance was. moreover  this theory was continually grown and refined from l e f t to r i g h t in one continuous and unbroken development. only in the postscript did we develop a second competing theory. this is unfortunately very unusual. the more typical situation is that there are several  or even many  competing theories developed in the course of an analysis  and some of them may be discontinuous   i . e . may relate words that are not adjacent to each other in the input  without any hypothesis for the words that f i l l the gap between them . in fact  when run without the incredible s e l e c t i v i t y which the human control component can generate by hunch  i n t u i t i o n   or  divine guidance    or perhaps just a l o t of unconscious enumeration and testing   a completely mechanical speech understanding system w i l l inevitably generate a large number of such theories which must be compared and evaluated. without some efort to decide which of the competing theories are worth pursuing and extending  an exhaustive enumeration would quickly be swamped in the combinatorics. 
a second example 
　　　a more typical simulation  although s t i l l easier than many  resulted in the following lextable: 

this is the state of lextable after considerable searching for possible words. at this point  every segment of the input is covered by some word  so there are no obvious places in the waveform where new word matches are needed. however  there is no sequence of words which covers the entire input. therefore there must be an acoustic error somewhere - the question is where. starting from the beginning of the utterance  we can f i n d the sequence of words  did any people   which is good syntactically and aemantically  but the closest next word to the predicted verb is the past p a r t i c i p l e  done . this word is inconsistent with the preceding word sequence  but specifically it is inconsistent with   d i d   . prom lunar's transition network grammar it is possible to infer that  done  is incompatible because the grammar is predicting at this point an untensed verb. moreover it is possible to infer from the state of the grammar that a past p a r t i c i p l e would be possible if the preciding verb was  have  or  be   and to follow back the analysis path to determine that the verb register was set by the word  did  at the beginning of the utterance. thus  a l l the groundwork is present to syntactically predict either  did any people do  or  have any people done . it turns out that the l a t t e r was the actual utterance with the i n i t i a l hh missing and the unstressed ae reduced to a schwa. correctly analyzing this utterance requires the a b i l i t y to draw the syntactic inference that the i n i t i a l word was  have . 
　　　given that we correctly discover  have   we now have a continuous sequence  have any people done chemical analyses on  which is syntactically and semantieally very plausible even though the word matches for  chemical  and  analyses  are not perfect. however  there are no successful word matches beginning at position 1. recall the general rule that the absence of word matches at a given point indicates either that the preceding word matches were accidental or that there is an acoustic error. if the p o s s i b i l i t y of an acoustic error were not considered then the f i r s t half of this rule would undo a l l the word matches back to position 1  and would seem j u s t i f i e d since the matches of  chemical  and  analyses  are not perfect . somehow the size and semantic goodness of the current theory must keep it under consideration in spite of i t s acoustic flaws. 
　　　notice that we are in a context where syntax can predict determiners. suppose that we assume that there is a determiner here and look for the next word somewhere to the r i g h t . we find the word  rock  at 1 which makes excellent semantic sense and matches to the end of the sentence. we could now assume that there is a missing determiner from 1 to 1 with greater confidence  and if we look at the acoustics with the determination to f i n d the best possible determiner match  however tenuous   we should come up with   t h i s   due to a d i s t i n c t acoustic  s  at 1. this is in fact the correct analysis. the unstressed   t h i s   was pronounced something l i k e  ax s  with the i n i t i a l th completely i n v i s i b l e in the spectrogram  and probably not pronounced by the speaker   
conclusion 
　　　we believe the two examples given in this paper convey a good picture of the types of p r o b a b i l i s t i c   plausible inferences that a continuous speech understanding system w i l l have to be capable of making in order to extract meaning out of the speech signals that human beings produce. the task requires the integration of several inference components  control  syntax  semantics  and extract  each of which has an open ended set of possible alternatives that it can pursue with smaller and smaller likelihood of success. one must have some method of dovetailing the computations of a l l of these components together  since any given component would effectively never f i n i s h trying increasingly remote p o s s i b i l i t i e s . moreover  it is probably essential that the individual components maintain their own data structures and special strategies tuned to the special nature of their tasks and not be subsumed under some monolithic general purpose inference procedure. thus one of the essential tasks of control w i l l be to balance the resource allocation among the various components in order to maximize the benefit - e.g. it would be foolish to try extremely improbable word matches when one had not yet tested the syntactic and semantic acceptability of better word match combinations. 
　　　the speech under standing problem is almost a complete microcosm of the general robot planning problem and in some ways more d i f f i c u l t . we have the same problems of representing  alternative worlds   in this case our theories about the utterance   of drawing together a diversity of facts to find out about our real world environment  in this case the utterance   and of putting these facts together to produce appropriate actions. moreover  we have the same problem  not yet effectively dealt with in robot projects  of coping with the basic uncertainty or incompleteness of the input data and the necessity to make assumptions. we have the same or even more c r i t i c a l need to devise inference techniques which avoid the redundant derivation of the same conclusion in exponentially many different ways  while on the other hand  we need to be able to derive the equivalent of a proof with a step missing and to use that   p r o o f to predict the missing step. 
　　　because of the uncertainty of the input and the open ended p o s s i b i l i t i e s for error  s t r i c t l y logical systematic enumeration methods for deductive inference w i l l not s u f f i c e . the space of p o s s i b i l i t i e s is too vast to search in i t s entirety. it is essential to have inference techniques which  play the odds  and follow out the most promising p o s s i b i l i t i e s f i r s t . we must also be able to terminate and ask questions of the user when the law of diminishing returns makes that alternative more economical than continued search. we believe this to be true not only for speech understanding  but also for robot problems as w e l l . an i n t e l l i g e n t automaton cannot function on just those inferences which it is logically j u s t i f i e d in making deductively - it w i l l hardly ever have sufficient data. rather it must constantly be making assumptions based on likelihood. however  it must know where i t s deductions depend on such assumptions so that it can cope with situations in which they prove false. 
　　　in the bbn speech project  we are attempting to build a system along the lines suggested here. we w i l l be attempting to combine likelihood estimates with the inference processes that construct and refine theories and use these to control the allocation of resources among the various components. prom this attempt  we hope not only to obtain a viable speech understanding system  but also to increase our understanding of the role of deductive inference in the face 
of uncertain data.
