we analyze conditions that allow for sound and efficient non-monotonic inference for that we consider theories comprised of rule1 and observations and a semantic framework developed elsewhere that allows us to view such theories as dynamic systems systems with a transition function f that maps states to sets of possi ble successor states and a plausibility funr tion that determines the relative likelihood of those transitions in this framework the transition function f is determined by the rules and the plausibility function is provided independently in this work we aim to identify plausibility functions that have good semantical and computational properties we do so b  identifying a vet of tore predictions to be accounted for that can be computed in polynomial time  can be justified in simple terms and are not tied to either horn theories or closed world assumptions the resulting functions allow us to handle an interesting class of theories in a justifiable and efficient manner

non-monotonic reasoning is widely perceived to be inefficient and sevtral theoretical studies have confirmed that suspicion for a large class of theories  e g    kautz and selman  1   yet  nianj practical systems including inheritance reasoners time map managers and logic programs with negation as failure suggest that non-monotonic reasoning can be both practical and effi cient in many cases of interest stratified logic programs  for example  are tractable when negation is interpreted as negation as failure  van gelder et al 1  and intractable when interpreted classically 
　in this work  we aim to understand conditions that allow for sound and efficient non-nonmonotonic inference for that we appeal to the semantic frampwork recently introduced in  geffner 1  geffner and bonet 1  in which systems of strict and defeasible rules are viewed as dynamic systems with a transition function / that maps states pie  to sets f s   of possible successors and a plausibility function pie that determines the relative plausibility of those possible transitions 
　in this framework  the transition function / s1   is given by the collection of states * l + 1 such that the iran sitions from s  to s1+j violate a minimal set of default rules lhe plausibility function pie  on the other hand is provided independently and it's role is to determine the assumptions one is willing to make about missing information in particular when the plausibility function it is uniform  1 e it assigns the same plausibility number to all stales  no assumptions are made and the resulting semantics is monotonic in the set of observations while non-monotonii in the set of rules * on the other hand when jt is compatible with the c losed world assumption  cwa  namelv ir uj1 s   stands for the number of atoms true m state s   the higher the number the less plausible the state   the resulting semantics is n on-mono tonic in the observations and corresponds to the interpretations of negation as failure found in logic programs in neither case  however  lhe semantics is adequate n the first case is too weak and in the second is too strong interestingly however while in the first case the semantics is intractable  in the second case the semantics is tractable 
　in this work we will look for plausibility functions that havt good semantical and computational properties w will do so by identifying a set of core predictions to be accounted for that can be computed in polynomial time can bejuslified in various wavs and are not tied to either horn theories or closed world assumptions lhe resulting functions will enable us to handlt an interesting class of theories in a. justifiable and efficient manner 
　the plan of the paper is as follows first we review the semantic framework laid out in  geffner 1  and  geffner and bonet  1   section 1  fh en we con sider the virtues and limitations of the cwa interpreta tion and define the core predictions in three ways by means of a procedure a 1-valued logical interpretation and an epistemi. interpretation  section 1  we then characterize other tractable conclusions that follow from the admissible plausibility functions  presuppositions  stud} semantic and syntactic conditions that guarantee the existence of such functions and assess the admissi-

1 	summary 
we have identified a basic core of inferences that can be justified in simple terms and have developed a semantics that makes those inferences sound the semantics has good computational properties combines elements from causal conditional and extensional interpretations of defaults  and sheds some light on the adequacy of various plausibility ordenngs and on the scope of interpretations that view default rules epistemically
