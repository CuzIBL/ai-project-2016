　　　　　　the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n of a set of patterns is a problem that appears in very many f i e l d s . in 
the most simple case the number of d i f f e r e n t c l a s ses possible is known a p r i o r i ; t h i s is the case  f o r example  of printed characters of a given t y pe. but in general t h e i r number is unknown. 
             in a general way  the problem of c l a s s i f i c a t i o n is the following : being given a set of patterns one makes certain measurements on these patterns and wants to determine subsets which are  w i t h respect to these measurements  i n t e r n a l l y as s i m i l a r as possible and externally as d i s s i m i l a r as possible. more formally  we have to define a p a r t i t i o n of the set of patterns ; that i s   a set of sub-sets which are mutually exclusive and c o l l e c t i v e l y exhaustive. it is not always possible to reach t h i s ideal goal  sometimes the sub-sets are

i n t e r n a l l y s i m i l a r and externally d i s s i m i l a r but neither exclusive nor exhaustive.

             p a r t i t i o n . one uses a set of distance values  or s i m i l a r i t y c o e f f i c i e n t s   in the form of a t r a i n gular matrix ; each distance  or s i m i l a r i t y   being attached to a p a i r of pattern independently of the order in which one considers these patterns. the distances are to be evaluated from the rough data available on these patterns. i f   in making the evaluation  one does not lose information the distance matrix w i l l exactly represent the i n i t i a l date. unhappily t h i s is r a r e l y so. moreover actual patterns are very often composite  the distance between two composite patterns is not very s i g n i f i c a n t and it is necessary to extract f i r s t the elementary components of composite patterns. 
1 - feature extraction 
             in a l l that follows we w i l l especially consider geometrical or more exactly topological patterns. a good example is a meteorological map. in t h i s l a t t e r case  we are interested by ombil i c a l points  either highest or lowest atmospher i c pressure   and by evolution of these points. the problem to be solved is to summarize f i r s t the actual pattern by a set of features and a f t e r to c l a s s i f y a set of such maps. 
　　　　　　for t h i s kind of p a t t e r n   	it is possible to associate w i t h each pattern s a c e r t a i n char a c t e r i s t i c f u n c t i o n s which contains a l l the rough date available concerning that p a t t e r n . the energy 	/ e s 1 de associated w i t h t h i s character i s t i c f u n c t i o n is f i n i t e because the actual p a t terns are of f i n i t e dimensions. the set of char a c t e r i s t i c functions s constitute a h i l b e r t spaand it is possible to define on l 1 a base 
orthonormal function 	i 	so that : 
	 e . 	 e .de = 	if* i 

l   e   . 	* *   e   . d e = 1 
           thus it is natural to use as operators g. the group of scalar products which are the projections of pattern on the base i  and to define the main features g  of the pattern s by : 
 *=  l 
             the set of c o e f f i c i e n t s g. is 	convergent and we have the parseval equality f o r a cert a i n base of orthononnal functions called t o t a l  and complete if the set is f i n i t e   	: 

the above property is interesting as it permits evaluation of that which we might call the quality of pattern features extraction : the right s i de of the relation measures the pattern energy  we can evaluate as a function of the rank i to which we have carried the analysis what is the percentage of the energy of the pattern summed up in the set of i f i r s t computed features g by calculating the sum of their squares and decide to stop the analysis when the summation corresponds to 1 or 1 % of the total energy of the pattern to be summed up. 
           if it is possible to use distance between two patterns s e  and  e   this quantity is the sum of the squares of the differences of the corresponding coefficients g  and x  : 

this type of analysis is extremely classic ; the fourier transformation is a particular case using the orthogonal properties of circular functions. two spatial or temporal functions are identical if they have the same spectrum and we can compare several functions by calculating the sum of the squares of differences between the frequency components ; the greater this sum is the more distinct the functions w i l l be. in place of the circular functions one also uses the orthogonal polynomials of tchebicheff  legendre  hermite  jacobi  laguerre  etc. bases are more or less efficiency ; theoritically  the best efficiency is achieved with a karhunen-loeve base of ortho-
gonal eigen-functiona . but  from a practical point of view it is sometimea preferable to use more classic orthogonal bases. 
unidimensional patterns of the morse type s i gnals dot-dash-space   1     the use of hermite*s polynomials f o r pattern recognition has been proposed by g.e. lowitz  . we have pointed outihe i n t e r e s t of t h i s proceedure but also the discrepancy between the discontinuous character of the patterns to be summed up and the c o n t i nuous aspect of the hermite functions. in other words  an hermite base is a bad one to summarize rough date if one admits that these rough data are e s s e n t i a l l y linked to the d i s c o n t i n u i t i e s of s. 
             it is more normal to t h i n k of using bases of discontinuous orthonormal functions which permit a p r i o r i a better analysis t h e r e fore a smaller information loss ; thus we can define the distances between patterns which w i l l have more sense. 
1 - haar's orthonormal base 
             haar's functions  constitute an example of such a base. their use in pattern recognition proceedures has already been e n v i saged   1     therefore our study has been modified and hermites functions have been replaced by haar's functions. 
             the goal is the automated analysis of maps. but  it is too d i f f i c u l t to f r o n t - a t t a c k t h i s problem and we have used f i r s t the same one dimensional patterns as before. 
             without losing anything of the gener a l i t y one can  because the monodimensional patterns to be analysed are of f i n i t e energy and therefore of f i n i t e dimensions lead the study in the normalized range 1 . 1 . haar's 1 n functions of the n t h order are defined as follows  see f i gure 1 . 


             in a f i r s t p a r t of our study  we have used a base of orthonormal functions deduced from 
hermite's polynomials to characterize geometric

1 - numerical examples 
           the interest in using a base of haarfs orthonormal functions is brought out in the examples that follow. 
           some of the analyzed patterns are represented in figure 1. the amplitude can only take but two values 1 or h  h being such that the total energy of the pattern w i l l be unity on the norma-
lized range  1 . 
           figures 1  1  1 represent the haar spectrum up to the 1th order  which is 1 coefficients per pattern. from this we can deduce a certain number of properties which are the f o l l o -
wing  for the unidimensional patterns analyzed . 
a  a coefficient equal to 1 over a given inter-val signifies that over that interval the feature representing the signal is a constant  null or not or that it is symetrical relative to the mean of that interval. 
b  a positive coefficient signifies that on the f i r s t half of the interval the signal is longer than on the second half  this indicates that at least a discontinuity exists over the interval. a negative coefficient leads to the inverse conclusions. 
c  if a l l the coefficients are nuls to the m order  and if the sum of the squares of the coefficients calculated up to then is equal to the energy contained in the signal a l l the other coefficients of an order greater than m w i l l be nuls  the calculated coefficients exactly sura up the pattern. 
d  as soon as the quantity c  = 1 - j being the order of the haar function - is less than the smallest interval appearing in the pattern  only the discontinuities w i l l appear. this property is very important because it permits to 
-1-
state that from a certain number n  which 	is 
unknown a priori because we don't know the pattern  only the discontinuities remain ; which clearly appears in the examples shown. 
e  the accuracy with which we represent the pattern is linked to the value of the interval  i.e. to the order of the haar function where the analysis has reached. 
           therefore it is possible to reconstruct the pattern from the coefficients of the n order  taking into account the discontinuities appearing on the intervals of a lenght greater than 1~n-1. as an example this is shown in f i gure 1 : at the 1  o r d e r of the haar functions the 1 t h   1 t h   1 t h   1 t h   1 r d and 1 t h coefficients are different from zero  the interval lenght for this order is 1  thus we know that the pattern presents a discontinuity for the 1 t h   1   1 t h   1 t h   1 r d and 1th interval of the reconstructed pattern of figure. 1. 
           the extraction of the main features of a monodimensional geometric pattern by projection on a haar orthonormal base is then a proceedure that permits a very small information loss. in this way we can make the comparisons between structures  on one hand by considering the number of discontinuities brought out at the order where one has stopped and on the other hand by considering the value of the coefficients. for example  the patterns of figure 1. are very close to each other and have just two discontinuities  they are symetrical in relation to the middle of the interval  1 . these properties appear in the values of the coefficients which are symetrical in relation to 1. 
           if the patterns to be analyzed have not the noiseless character of figure 1. but they are deformed  for example  by the presence of noise  the analysis w i l l remain valid. as we can see in figures 1  1 and 1 the nuls coefficients are no longer nuls  but certain of the most characteristic amongst them stand out clearly from the background noise of the others. the pattern signal to noise level is roughly 1 db. 
1 - conclusion 
           the classification of a set of patterns by the projection on a total base of orthonormal functions permits to summarize the patterns in an efficient manner ; on the condition of choosing a base matched to the properties of the patterns which concern the classification. in 

the case of geometric patterns where the discontinuities play an essential role  the use of haar's functions appears to be very promising as we have seen in the examples given above in the particular case of monodimensional patterns. ve must add that haar's functions are particularly well adapted to computation by digital computer. 
           for actual bidimensional patterns such as maps  it is possible to use either bidimensional haar's function or a topological description of bidimensional space onto monodimensional one   1   . ve are trying to evaluate what is the most efficient.
