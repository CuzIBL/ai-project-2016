 
　　　this paper argues that a number of different kinds of meaning representation  between which partial translations can be made as needed  are all required for a reasonably comprehensive language processing system. these representations capture different and possibly complementary aspects of a text's form  content and reference worlds  and are suited to different subtasks of the language processor. i n i t i a l testing of the proposition via a system designed for natural language access to 
databases is described  showing how different types of meaning representation with different characteristics are called for  related  and used.* input-text-driven operations required to carry through the system's particular task. thus for natural language translation  for example  relatively inexplicit and shallow representations have been deemed adequate  while for systems involving more extensive inference  for example question answering  more explicit and deeper representations are commonly used. some systems involving language may be sufficiently restricted or specialised to f a l l outside this paradigm  by not posing serious requirements for text meaning representation: for example systems exploiting simple input texts to modify an independent 
database not intended to record linguistic features of the text. 

1. 	introduction: 	the 	single 	representation assumption 
　　　it has been widely assumed in natural language processing research that a reading for a piece of text has a single meaning representation. when a cycle of morphological  syntactic  semantic and pragmatic processing has been carried out for some piece of text  the resulting representation embodying the system's interpretation  or 'understanding'  of the text is the only form of representation proper to the text. a representation may be modified  for example if the processing of a later sentence supplies a specific referent for a definite noun phrase. but it is not changed in kind. thus if the system's language-processing task depends on a long-life  large-scale text representation  this may be modified in the course of processing by the arrival of new information; but it is not replaced by a different type of representation. 
　　　this assumption underlies approaches working with representations of quite different content and form  and both approaches working with 'shallow' representations and those working with 'deep' ones  defining the former very broadly here for illustrative purposes as representations close to the actual text structure  and the latter as representations which do not attempt to preserve the given order  or individuality  of text items. the general approach so far has been to choose a 
　　　means of representation which appears sufficiently informative  but abstract  to support the 

1. 	the multiple representation requirement 
　　　it is  however  at least possible that f u l l text interpretation  even for the very modest task systems that are all we can tackle at present  requires more than one meaning representation. that is  the system requires representations which are all meaning representations because they are interpretable in an underlying world  but which are couched in different representation languages having distinctive characteristics appropriate to particular subtasks of the overall task. the relation between the representation languages may be quite complex  and distinct but related underlying worlds may be involved. the important point is that the different meaning representations all have genuine status within the system: we are not concerned with the case where several representations  which could all be deemed meaning representations  are constructed  but all but the final one are treated as disposable intermediates. i claim that when a language processing system's task requirements are investigated  they imply that the system must be able to manipulate  simultaneously and on demand  several different types of meaning representation for a text  conveying different and even exclusive kinds of information. 
　　　these representations cannot be mere notational variants of one another. if the task system is to make use of them for different subtasks  there must be procedures for moving  or translating  from one form to another; but this does not imply that all of the properties of the text expressed in either of a pair of

representations between which translation is being made are to be genuinely found in the other. it is important here to distinguish proper  functional  elements of a representation from mere baggage. for example  one representation may preserve specific lexical items  the other indicate only underlying primitive concepts; attaching lexical items to the latter to ensure some recovery of the former does not necessarily imply that the lexical items in the latter have any true representational function. the assumption is that for any pair of meaning representations  p a r t i a l   but not complete  equivalence exists  permitting transitions between them. saying that this set of representations nevertheless collectively constitutes a single meaning representation is vacuous. 
　　　the motive for the view that more than one representation is required is supplied  on the one hand  by tasks like machine translation. it is evident that natural language translation  at least for some purposes  must seek to preserve text structure and expression  i.e. text narrative form. it is equally evident that correct translation can require arbitrarily extensive inference  for example to identify pronoun referents or compound noun structures  and quite possibly both 'weak' inference of the kind illustrated by wilks and 'strong' inference dependent on explicit quantification. the complementary motivation is supplied by observations like partee's  that an explicit quantification of a sentence like  more people get more satisfaction out of l&m's than out of any other cigarette  is so complex that it doubtfully reflects the simple  if furry  meaning accepted by the reader. 
　　　taking predicate-logic-type representations as deep  examples like this suggest that the different meaning representations may have different depths  and specifically  that there is a single sequence of representations. but cases like translation suggest that different representations at similar depths are also needed  and specifically shallow representations for the input and output natural languages  which are directly related to one another as well as to deeper representations. thus it is more important to focus on differences of representation content than of depth. 
1. 	investigating multiple requirements 
	our 	current 	project 	 boguraev 	and 	sparck 
jones  1  t for database access  provides an appropriate environment for an i n i t i a l study of the need for several meaning representations  and of mechanisms for moving from one to another. this follows from the approach to database access being adopted. the objective of a natural-language front-end processor for a database management system is to convert a natural language question into a  formal  search query appropriate to the particular data model used for the database: e.g. into an expression in relational algebra. the normal processing strategy adopted for this purpose involves applying a data-domain-specific semantic processor either alongside  or largely subsuming  conventional syntax. the present project's aim is to avoid having to provide a new semantic processor operating directly on input text for every new database. the approach adopted assumes that a good deal of semantic as well as syntactic processing can be achieved using domain-independent information  and that the domain-specific processing which is necessarily required for the database access task is reduced in scope and simplified by being able to exploit the output of the earlier general syntactic and semantic processing of the question. 
　　　in the system which has been constructed  the i n i t i a l general interpretation of the question provides a rich meaning representation of the input as a case-labelled dependency tree with slots f i l l e d by word senses defined by semantic primitives. this is then processed  s t i l l as a general  database-independent operation  to derive a predicate-logic-type representation in the lunar style  woods  1   retaining the case relation and category primitive information  but discarding linguistic information like clause boundary markers. the logic representation is in turn processed using domain-specific information to map the case and category information onto the object  property and relationship concepts of the database world. the formal query representation thus generated is in turn converted into the actual search representation of the input which is a relational algebra expression geared to the administrative organisation of the database. all these operations are semantics driven  but are inevitably different in their essential character  just because they are designed to build different representations  and are too complex to detail here.  they have already been quite extensively tested on a sample database.  
　　　in the present context  the relevant properties of this natural language processor are f i r s t   that the various representations of the input question are all meaning representations. because the i n i t i a l representations for the input have a perfectly good direct representation in the ordinary world  via the case and category primitives  it cannot be said that the only meaning representation for the question is the final search query. the approach of lunar and phliqa1  bronnenberg et a l   1  is not being followed here. equally  both query and search representations refer to the database world. second  it is not the case that the four representations differ only in the domain independence or dependence of their semantics. this in i t s e l f constitutes an important difference of representation content; but there are also significant differences of content and form between the i n i t i a l question representation and the logic representation  which exploit different view of the ordinary world  and between query and search representation  which exploit different views of the database world. these differences may also be seen as differences of depth: the i n i t i a l representation is in an obvious sense shallower than the logic representation; but this is not the difference of real importance here. 

       the fact that the processor generates j u s t four e x p l i c i t representations i s a r b i t r a r y : t h i s i s a product of experimental system design. no claim is being made for the i n d i v i d u a l d e t a i l s of the various representational forms. what matters is that the task  which is an instance of a widespread language-using a c t i v i t y   namely i n q u i r y   presupposes references to d i f f e r e n t worlds - the general and the s p e c i a l   and uses d i f f e r e n t forms of representation r e l a t i n g to each of these worlds -  loosely  the l i n g u i s t i c and the l o g i c a l . to argue that we are r e a l l y operating in one w o r l d   constructed from two source worlds  is a f o r m a l i s t view which f a i l s to capture the fact that it is the construction process i t s e l f which is embedded in the task; more i m p o r t a n t l y   the representations are not n o t a t i o n a l v a r i a n t s   as information is thrown away in the t r a n s i t i o n s from one to another. 
       that so f a r   these t r a n s i t i o n s are made in one d i r e c t i o n o n l y   is i r r e l e v a n t . while the f i r s t requirement of a database access system is for a s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d search equivalent of the input natural language question  it is obvious that a 
       fully-developed access system w i l l involve other i n t e r a c t i o n s between representations  and t r a n s i t i o n s   in other d i r e c t i o n s . these w i l l be r e q u i r e d   in p a r t i c u l a r   f i r s t to meet the inference needs of question i n t e r p r e t a t i o n   and second  to respond e f f e c t i v e l y to the user. 
       inference processes have not yet been designed for the system  and it is not clear in d e t a i l what form they should take. however a beginning has been made on response processes. one obvious response is checking the question i n t e r p r e t a t i o n with the user. for t h i s   reformulation of the question r e f l e c t i n g each stage in i t s processing has i t s own j u s t i f i c a t i o n . for example  t e x t paraphrases generated from the f i r s t   dependency representation can show the user  in language close to his own  how l i n g u i s t i c ambiguities have been resolved; generation from the logic representation can check the desired scope of q u a n t i f i c a t i o n   and generation from the query and search 
representations the way the user's question is being viewed in the database context. figure 1 shows examples of t e x t s generated f i r s t from the i n i t i a l dependency r e p r e s e n t a t i o n   and second from the f i n a l search r e p r e s e n t a t i o n   for a database question. the f i r s t indicates disambiguation  the second makes obvious reference to the r e l a t i o n a l s t r u c t u r e of the database. the t e x t d i f f e r e n c e s r e f l e c t the d i f f e r e n t f u n c t i o n a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f the underlying source r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s . generation here is done d i r e c t l y ; it does not have to proceed through inverses of the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n and where t h i s might be a p p r o p r i a t e   it would not imply that i n d i v i d u a l input representations were recovered: only ones as near as the representation language r e l a t i o n s h i p s allow.

1. 	conclusion 
       i n v e s t i g a t i o n of other language processing tasks  l i k e summarising  supports the argument for m u l t i p l e r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s : f a r - r a n g i n g and heterogeneous inference operations may be required to i d e n t i f y important parts of a t e x t   but there is also a need  for at least some a b s t r a c t i n g purposes  to r e t a i n global n a r r a t i v e s t r u c t u r e . the essential language processing model being proposed here is therefore one using a set of 
meaning representations for an input  or output  e x h i b i t i n g d i s t i n c t   and in the l i m i t e x c l u s i v e   properties of the source t e x t   with t r a n s l a t i o n between these e x p l o i t i n g d i f f e r e n t s p e c i f i c common types of element for p a r t i c u l a r t r a n s i t i o n s   as required to meet various i n t e r p r e t i v e subtasks. the present p r o j e c t aims to show what d i f f e r e n t representations are needed and what mechanisms are r e q u i r e d   working c o l l a b o r a t i v e l y   to use them. 
       the idea of m u l t i p l e representations is in some ways s i m i l a r in motivation to the idea of m u l t i p l e d e s c r i p t i v e viewpoints embodied in the design of krl  bobrow and winograd  1 . but bobrow and winograd do not consider the systematic e x p l o i t a t i o n of these ideas for the purposes of producing d i f f e r e n t types of non-equivalent t e x t meaning representation as considered here  or the procedures required to move from one to the other.
