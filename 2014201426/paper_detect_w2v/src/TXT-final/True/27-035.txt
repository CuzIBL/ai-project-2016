the most important thing to observe about the temporal ontology implicit in natural language tense and aspect is that it ir not purely temporal to take a simple example the english perfect when predicated of an event like losing a watch says that some contextually retrievable consequences of the event in question hold at the time under discussion  such consequences have sometimes been described under the heading of   present relevance of the perfect   as a result  conjoining such a perfect 
with a further clause denying those consequences is infelicitous 
 1  i have lost my watch  # but 1 have found it again  
in this respect the perfect stands in contrast to the more purely temporal tenses  such as the past  which make no comparable claim about the consequences of the core event 
 1  yesterday i lost my watrh  but 1  have  found it again  
it is because categories like the perfect are not purely temporal that it is usual to distinguish them from the tenses proper as ' aspects another aspect whose meaning is not purelv temporal is the progressive or lmperfective the predication that it makes concerning the core event is a subtle one while the progressive clearly states that some event is ongoing at the time under discussion it is not necessarily the event that is actuallv mentioned thus in a helow there seems to be a factive entailment about an event of writing but in b  there 1 no such entailment concerning an event of writing a sonnet  for b is true even if the author was interrupted before he could complete the action

dowty  named this rather surprising property of the progressive the imperfective paradox the imper 
fective paradox is a sign that we must distinguish various types or sorts of core event in natural language tempo ral ontology this system  which is described at greater length in  steedman in press.   is briefly summarised as follows 
　there are two key insights into this system which most theories either build upon or are forced to reinvent i he first concerns the temporal ontolog  itself and is usually attributed to vendler  though there are precedents in work by jespersen kenny and many earlier author itjes including aristotle vendler s taxonom  was importantly refined bv  erkuyl and dowty  and ha.s been further extended by manv others such taxonomies typically distinguish 'states from events' and divide the latter into a number of wrts or types  endler dislin guished 'activities    events which have duration but don t change state like heat* writing   achievements  events which have no duration but do chang* stat  like h eats amvmg   and accomplishments  which hav* duration and change state like heats writing a sonnet  many authors have proposed recursive sort hierarchies 
moens  1  1  explained the aspectual sort hierarchy and possible coercions among akiionsaricn m terms of a structure of the kind represented schematically in figure 1  representing an association in memory or the knowledge representation of all events with characteristic preparations and consequents  an idea that has 1ince been adopted in dr. theory  kamp and reyle   1  p 1  moens claimed lhat the preparation is in vendler's terms an activity  the consequent is a  perfect  state  and that the core event is an achievement ihere is a great deal more to say about the status of these categories  but we will take it as read here  noting merely that we bhall follow these authors m assuming that accomplishments like writing a sonnet are composites of an activity of writing and a culminating achievement of

not only for quantifying over states but to act as the temporal link between sentences and clauses  as in whenclau es and multi-sentence discourse several logical and computational approaches have explored this possibility 
　temporal anaphora like all discourse anaphora and reference resolution is even more intimately dependent upon world knowledge than the other temporal categories lhat we have been considering in order to control this influence  wp will follow the style of much work in ai drawing moat of our examples from a restricted domain of discourse we will follow isard  in taking a hoard game as the example domain imagine that each model in a modal structure is represented as a database  or collection of facts describing not only the position of 1 he pieces in a game of chess  and the instantaneous moves at each frame  but the fact that at certain times durative or composite events like exchanging rooks or white attacking the black queen are in progress across more than one state 
consider the following examples from such a domain 
 1  a when i took your pawn you took my queen b 1 took your pawn you look my queen 
the ufaen-clause in a  above establishes a reference point for the tense of the main clause  just as the definite np j  eats establishes a referent for the pronoun indeed the 
twacn-claube itself behaves like a definite  in that it seems to presuppose that  he event of my taking your pawn is identifiable lo the hearer  of course  the reader will have effortlessly accommodated this presupposition in lewis and stalnaker s sense of the term  the first sentence in b  above  behaves exacljv like the when clause in setting the reference point for the second i he onl  difference is that the simple declarative / took your pawn itself demands a previously established reference point to be anaphoric to  whereas the when clause causes a new reference point to be constructed 
　as has been frequentl  noticed  the state to which the tense in you taking my queen refers in a  above  is not strictly the state in which / took your pawn it is the slate that resulted from that action however  it is not invariably the case that the temporal reference point moves on in this way most obviously a stative main clause is primarily predicated of the original reference point of the whtn-clause 
 1  when i took your pawn t did not know it was protected by your knight 
 presumably  the ignorance in question maj have ended with that very move   events also may be predicated of the original reference point rather than moving the action on 
 1  when i took your pawn  i used a. rook 
in fact  as ritchie   partee   moens and steedman   and kamp and reyle  have pointed out  in strictly temporal terms  we can find main clauses that precede the reference point established by a when clause 
 1  when i won my only game against bobby fischer  we played australian rules 
　these phenomena arise because the temporal referent is not strictly temporal rather than being a time or an
