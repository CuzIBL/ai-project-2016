step 1 : if aok is a singleton stop: ok. is the most general u n i f i e r of a. 
step i i i : compute the disagreement set of ao k ; order this set such that the variables are in f r o n t   the rest of the ordering being immaterial. if vk and uk are the two e a r l i e s t elements of the disagreement set and vk is a variable that does not occur in uk then o k + 1 := ok. {vk- uk}; k := k+1 ; go to step 1 otherwise stop then a is not u n i f i a b l e . 
unification theorem  let a be a non-empty finite eet of expressions. if a is unifiable then there exists a most general unifier o of a which is com-
puted 	by 	the 	unification 	algorithm. 
       during the computation of a deduction in automatic theorem proving a great amount of u n i f i c a t i o n computations has to be performed. the implementat i o n of the u n i f i c a t i o n algorithm can be done much 
more e f f i c i e n t than a straightaway implement a t i o n ; see 1  1 and 1 j.

most general 	unifier. 	a u n i f i e r 	o 	of 	a 	set 	of 	subs t i t u t i o n s 1 = lo t .j 	is called a most general u n i f i e r if for a l l u n i f i e r s 	i 	of 1 there exists a 
s u b s t i t u t i o n a such that 	t= 	na; the instance fljo is called the most general 	instance of 1.

note 
1. by d e f i n i t i o n it holds that a l l v j ' s in a subs t i t u t i o n are d i f f e r e n t . 
1. the most general u n i f i e r of expressions computed by the u n i f i c a t i o n algorithm as quoted in 1 is in normal form. 
1. the most general instance of a set of s u b s t i t u tions *c 1 -1  *  i is sometimes also denoted by 1*- .*1 ; t h i s operation is commutative and associative. 
a s u b s t i t u t i o n component v * t is called circular if v occurs in t. 
a set of substitutions 1   {1 - }     . 	is called contradictory 	if 	there 	are 	two 	substitutions 	1 |   	1 in g such that there is a s u b s t i t u t i o n component 
vj 	-* tj . in 1 j and a s u b s t i t u t i o n component vj 	* t j m in 1ffl such that vj 	- vj 	and the terms

algorithms and theorems 
　　　we now give the algorithm to compute the roost general u n i f i e r o of a set of substitutions l 1 .   n 	 .

wo assume that in each s u b s t i t u t i o n of a set of substitutions the substitution-components are ordered according to a fixed enumeration of a l l v a r i ables and there are no c i r c u l a r components.

theorem i . 	be a non-empty set of 
substitutions. if 1 is unifiable then there exists a moet general unifier o of qand o is determined by the substitution unification algorithm. the proof goes s i m i l a r l y to that of the u n i f i c a t i o n theorem. 

theorem 1. given a unifiable set of substitutions  1i*  l oue  that  ♀ is in normal form for all i. the most aeneral instance of  is also a uni-
fier 	of 
proof. let the most general u n i f i e r of 
be o then  is the most general i n stance. because of the normal form of the s u b s t i tutions  holds. because of the associat i v i t y of the composition of substitutions we have: 
and therefore 
u n i f i e r . 
theorem 1. for a given set of expressions which is unifiable we can compute the most general unifier also by applying the substitution unification algorithm on the set of substitutions formed by algorithm 1 from the disagreement sets. then the 
m.g.u. of the expressions is the most general instance of these substitutions. 
  substitutions from the second algorithm are in normal form since every s u b s t i t u t i o n consists of but one s u b s t i t u t i o n somponent  the proof proceeds in two steps: f i r s t we prove that u n i f i a b i 1 i t y occurs in the same c ireurnstances; secondly we can prove that we get the same u n i f i e r up to isomorphisms. 
remark 
the computed u n i f i e r is not necessarily the most general one because variables which occur in ej can be deleted by s u b s t i t u i o n fl.; therefore they do not occur in the computed u n i f i e r . this is one of the reasons that the converse of the theorem does not hold in general. 
counterexamples 

however  the converse theorem holds if we r e s t r i c t the substitutions 1  to variables that occur in eand if the expressions e  do not have any v a r i a b l e s in common. 
theorem * . let  be a set of expressions 
which have no varxables in common and are unifiable with a moet general unifier o. let  be a set 
of substitutions such that a variable occuring in 
1  does not occur in and has as left-hand sides of its components only variables 
occuring in e . 	if the set of expressions is 	unifiable 	then 	the set of substitutions  is 	unifiable. 
the proof proceeds by c o n t r a d i c t i o n along the d i f ferent steps of the s u b s t i t u t i o n u n i f i c a t i o n a l gorithm. 
example 
given e  * p   y f f   z     z   and e- - p   x   x   t   then the most general u n i f i e r of e| and e1 is

1 means not resolvable   i d e n t i c a l t o : opposite in sign and the absolute values are not u n i f i a b l e   . o1 means l i t e r a l 1 and l i t e r a l 1 are resolvable involving s u b s t i t u t i o n o1 where variables occurr i n g   in l i t e r a l 1 are indexed by i and variables occurring in l i t e r a l 1 by 1 so making the standard i z i n g apart quite easily. the following s u b s t i t u tions are involved in the matrix: 
       we work t h i s example out u s i n g c o n n e c t i o n graphs . if we use c o n n e c t i o n graphs it is a l most necessary to use the s u b s t i t u t i o n u n i f i c a t i o n a l g o r i t h m because the arcs between the clauses   l i t e r a l s   are in f a c t u n i f i e r s and new arcs can be computed from o l d arcs u s i n g t h i s a l g o r i thm. the i n i t i a l graph is made from the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n m a t r i x :
