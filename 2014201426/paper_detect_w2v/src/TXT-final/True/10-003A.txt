¡¡¡¡¡¡an intelligent story understanding program requires a great deal of knowledge about human intentionality. for example  consider the f o l lowing story: 
 1  john needed money. 
 1  he got a gun 
 1  and walked into a liquor store. 
 1  john told the owner he wanted his money.  1  the owner gave john the money 
 1  and john l e f t . 
to understand this story  we 	must 	realize 	that 
john's actions were motivated by a plan to obtain money by threatening someone. since this interpretation is not explicit in the story  it must be inferred by the understander. 
       pam  plan applier mechanism  is a program that understands stories by analyzing the intentions of the story's characters  and relating their intentions to their actions. pam reads in sentences in english  produces conceptual dependency  cd  meaning representations for them  and connects together lhese cd's to form a story representation. the story representation contains  in addition to the actual events of the story  a knowledge structure interpretation  ksi   which explains why these events occurred. 
       for example  pam can understand the story composed of sentences 1 above  and produces the following ksi  simplified for expository purposes : 
episode: type: 	coal-episode goal specification: 
	type: 	delta-cont 	planner: 	 john  
   object:  money  status: fulfilled plan specification: 
object:  money rel  liquor-store poss money   plan: threaten action:   . . .   
subepisodes: type: 	goal-episode goal specification: 
	type: 	delta-cont 	planner: 	 john  
   object: 	 weapon  plan specification: 	. . . 
	type: 	goal-episode

goal specification: 
	type: 	delta-prox 	plannek: 	 john  
   location: 	 prox part  money   plan specification: 	. . . 
response: type: 	goal-conflict goal specification: 
	type: 	preserve-health 
	planner: 	 owner rel liquor-store  
   status: fulfilled goal specification: 
	type: 	preserve-cont 
	planner: 	 owner rel liquor-store  
	object: 	 money rel liquor-store  
status: abandoned 
plan: 	comply 
action: 	  . . .   
       the whole s t o r y is i n t e r p r e t e d as a goalepisode  or sequence of events describing the p u r s u i t of a g o a l . the goal is a delta-cont  a t r a n s f e r of c o n t r o l type goal  of some money from i t s owner to john. the plan for the goal cons i s t s of s e l e c t i n g some p a r t i c u l a r money  the l i q u o r s t o r e ' s   and then threatening i t s owner. in implementing t h i s plan  several subgoals had to be achieved: being near the money  described in the abbreviated delta-prox sub-episode   and possessing a weapon  the delta-cont sub-episode . the action f i e l d denotes a p o i n t e r to the cd representing the r e a l i z a t i o n of the threat p l a n . 
       the response shows that the threat caused the l i q u o r store owner to have two c o n f l i c t i n g goals  that of preserving his money and that of preserving his w e l l - b e i n g . the status of the preserve-cont goal indicates that the owner has abandoned t h i s goal for the preserve-health g o a l   t o r which lie has chosen to comply w i t h john's demand. 
       in order to produce t h i s ksi  pam stores i t s knowledge of goals and plans in the form of cond i t i o n - a c t i o n r u l e s . t y p i c a l l y   the a p p l i c a t i o n of a r u l e gives r i s e to an expectation that is used to i n t e r p r e t f u t u r e sentences. for example  upon encountering sentence  1  above  pam accesses the r u l e :   i f a person obtains a funct i o n a l o b j e c t   then he intends to use i t .   this r u l e gives r i s e to an expectation that john w i l l use the gun to threaten or to overpower someone. when sentence  1  is encountered  t h i s expectat i o n causes pam to i n t e r p r e t it as a r e a l i z a t i o n of a threaten p l a n   as opposed to merely expressing one's d e s i r e . it is through the use of such expectations t h a t pam e f f e c t s contextual understanding.
