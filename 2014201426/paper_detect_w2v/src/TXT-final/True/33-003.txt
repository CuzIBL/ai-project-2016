 
　the parts of a typical piece of text vary greatly in interest. presented in this paper are three ways a concept can fail to be interesting - it can be irrelevant  reconstructible or overshadowed. the uses of interest in understanding are also discussed. 
1. introduction 
　not everything we read is interesting. even within a basically interesting piece of text  some concepts will seem much more important than others. some stories will carry so little interest that they can be ignored altogether. a key issue in studying the variable nature of interest is to understand why certain pieces of text are not interesting. after all  a priori  we might expect anything included in a story to be worth our full attention. 
　as a simple example of varying interest  consider story si. 
si - upi  1 july 1  lebanon 
unidentified gunmen monday ambushed a pro-iraqi politician  riddling him and his bodyguard with bullets  in the latest of the region's almost daily political assassinations. 
police sources said mussa shueib  a top official of the lebanese chapter of iraq's ruling baath party  was driving from beirut airport when his car was overtaken by armed men and sprayed with gunfire in a gangland-style hit. 
shueib and his bodyguard died on the spot. 
　in si  the death of the bodyguard would usually not be considered to be as interesting as the killing of shueib  it is overshadowed . neither is the method of the killing as a shooting too interesting  as it can be reconstructed from 
general knowledge of terrorism. several other points are simply irrelevant. having dispensed with the non-interesting  we are left will the interesting concept of an important pro-iraqi politician being killed in lebanon. 
　it is important to recognize that interest depends upon the current state of memory. interest is highly idiosyncratic from reader to reader and from time to time. concepts interesting to one reader at a given time may not be to other readers or at different times. for example  a reader who knows shueib's bodyguard personally would find the pieces of si about him quite interesting. 
　a computer understanding system will require long-term memory  such as that of ipp  the integrated partial parser   1  1   to be able to make use of interest. however  with this memory  it can use interest to help decide what to remember and to guide the understanding process. it was in the context of ipp that the ideas introduced here were developed. in section 1 i will describe the uses that interest can be put to. 
　generally  a testing process that concentrates on recognizing non-interest will be quite effective. fbr example  an algorithm that recognizes an instance of non-interest can immediately reduce or terminate its processing effort. the alternative  however  involves assuming that an item can be ignored only when it does not satisfy positive criteria for interest  a test that may produce an answer too late to be useful. 
1. the nature of  non  interest 
　interest might seem to be an arbitrary and hardto-define idea. however  some confusion is simply due to the fact that there are several distinct ways that a concept can be  or can fail to be  interesting. figure 1 lists three ways a concept 
can fail to be interesting. 
figure 1: grounds for non-interest 
1. concepts not causally connected to the main point of the story. 
1. concepts that can be reconstructed. 
1. concepts that are overshadowed. 
　lack of causal connection  see   and reconstructionty  see   explain a large number of situations where a piece of a text is not interesting. these are in some sense  logical  reasons for finding a concept non-interesting.

here i w i l l just present an example of each case. 
1 - upi  1 june 1  el salvador 
	a 	right-wing 	t e r r o r i s t 	group 	called 	the 
squadron of death k i l l e d 1 men saturday including a labor leader and three others shot to death as they ate breakfast in a restaurant  
police said. 
　in story s1  the fact that the victims of the t e r r o r i s t shooting were eating breakfast is not connected to the main causal chain of the story  and hence not interesting. i h i s part of the story is not important to our overall understanding  and 
w i l l be quickly forgotten. 
　1 provides an i l l u s t r a t i o n of r e c o n s t r u c t i v e concepts  
s1 - upi  1 june 1  guatemala 
the t e r r o r i s t s who kidnapped a nestle corp executive said friday he w i l l be released only if the swiss food firm comes up with an undisclosed ransom and pays for the publication 
of a t e r r o r i s t manifesto. 
　in this story  the t e r r o r i s t s asking for ransom is quite typical of kidnappings  and ao can be easily reconstructed from the simple knowledge that there was a kidnapping. as with the irrelevant part of s1  the r e c o n s t r u c t i b i l i t y of the ransom demand of s1 makes it not interesting. the demand for ransom w i l l not be long remembered  nor need it be processed in d e t a i l . 
　the third idea in figure 1  overshadowing  lacks the obvious rationale of irrelevance and r e c o n s t r u c t i b i l i t y . nonetheless it plays an important role in interest evaluation. consider the following story. 
s1 - upi  1 july 1  madrid 
l e f t i s t gunmen ambushed an army general in the center of madrid today wounding him but k i l l i n g a soldier in his escort  police said. unofficial reports said one of the general's aides and his chauffeur also were wounded in the early morning attack. 
　normally the k i l l i n g of the unnamed soldier would seem less interesting than the wounding of the general and the various i n j u r i e s less interesting s t i l l . however  this cannot be explained by either r e c o n s t r u c t i b i l i t y or non-causality. the death of the soldier and the wounding of the aides are certainly causal results of the attack. furthermore  the results surely cannot be reconstructed from memory. so why is it that the death and other injuries are ao much less interesting  
　stated simply  the attack on the general overshadows the other events. it is not that a soldier being k i l l e d is inherently non-interesting but that the attack on the general is more interesting. even though an event might be interesting by i t s e l f   most processing w i l l devoted to an overshadowing event. 
　a concept can have sufficient interest to overshadow for at least two d i s t i n c t reasons. it can be either important or unique. for example  the event   terrorists shot the president   is interesting because the victim of the shooting is important. ihis is contrasted with an event l i k e    three clowns f i r e d shots into a group of spectators   where nothing in the event is very important  but it is a r e l a t i v e l y unique event. 
　importance simply represents a concept for which the reader has a complex structure in memory. this is extremely idiosyncratic and dependent upon the current state of memory. important concepts for a given person might be his best f r i e n d   the president of the united states  and the status of his favorite football team. 
　uniqueness  in contrast  represents a concept that is different from others in memory. it can be used to explain the interest of a shooting by a 
　c h i l d   an explosion aboard a space ship  or the us hockey team's upset of the russians. a key problem to be studied involves figuring out j u s t how different an event must be before it seems unique  after a l l   in some sense a l l events are unique . 
　the lack of either importance or uniqueness w i l l quite l i k e l y result in a concept being overshadowed. it is the specific analysis of j u s t what determines importance and uniqueness that w i l l allow interest to be f r u i t f u l l y applied to understanding. 
	1. the uses of  non  	interest in understanding 
　interest has effects on both long-term memory for stories read and the parsing process. we have already seen that interest interrelates with memory. almost by d e f i n i t i o n   the parts of a story that are interesting are those that are remembered. this is an important controls on the accumulation of information in memory. particularly important is the a b i l i t y to omit material that can be reconstructed from memory  thus d r a s t i c a l l y reducing the quantity of information that must be stored.  see   1   1  for more oh the storage of 
	redundant 	information 	and 	the 	reconstruction 
process.  
　the analysis of interest described in this paper does make one important addition to the relation of interest and memory. the idea of overshadowing w i l l have an important affect on what is remembered. as i w i l l mention below  resources are usually not expended on detailed processing of the less interesting aspects of a story. this w i l l normally 
1 

result in such items being lost and not saved in memory. while this result is not cl early desirable for a computer memory system  it may be necessary for the same reason it occurs in human understanding - to allow the corresponding increase in efficiency of processing. 
　so we see that the basic effect of interest on memory is a simple one - interesting items are remembered  non-interesting ones are not. however  the effects on direct processing are more subtle. i 
w i l l mention here some of the p o s s i b i l i t i e s . 
　the primary role of interest in parsing is to help control processing and allow the optimal allocation of resources. this has been discussed to some degree in  and   1   . here i w i l l discuss one very powerful way interest can be used in an understanding system designed to process large numbers of texts. 
　the simplest use of interest in understanding is to make a decision to stop processing a sentence  or a story  that does not appear to be interesting. there is an obvious advantage in doing t h i s . stopping the processing of a sentence or story clearly gives the maximum possible gain in efficiency - processing time is reduced to zero for the rest of the item! and this is clearly s u f f i c i e n t   since as was noted before  low interest items usually need not be remembered at a l l . this use of interest w i l l give computer understanders an a b i l i t y   that people clearly have - the a b i l i t y to stop reading something. informally  a program employing the rules that i w i l l describe below w i l l have the a b i l i t y to become bored. 
　the basic idea is simply to track interest at both a sentence and a story  beginning at uncertain and continuing u n t i l a judgement can be made as to whether the item is or is not interesting. this is done using the rules described in this paper. if the conclusion is drawn that a story or sentence is not going to be interesting  then processing of that item can be stopped. 
　it would seem at f i r s t glance as if this plan should not work at a l l . tone of the rules that i have described d i f f e r e n t i a t e between elements of a story that appear at the beginning and those that appear l a t e r . thus it would seam possible that the items that make a sentence or story significant could occur at very end. using the rule described in the last paragraph  these items would never be processed. fbrtunately  in practice the key items do usually occur early on  presumably because authors know that rules such as the one above w i l l be applied. as an example of t h i s   we would be much more l i k e l y to find a story l i k e    the president was shot ...  rather than    i n an o f f i c i a l limousine today  while on a motorcade through dallas  a gunman in the book depository  who was later apprehended by police  shot the president.  
　out interest heuristics w i l l sometimes f a i l if the key items are idiosyncratic - not those the author would consider significant. for example  in a story about a building takeover where there were many hostages  the identity of the  low l e v e l   people taken hostage would not be found early in the story  but it might make the story s i g n i f i c a n t to a reader who knew one of these people. however  that is exactly the type of situation where a human reader would miss the key information. some sacrifices must be made to achieve adequate performance. 
1. conclusion 
　in this paper i have j u s t touched the surface of the problem of interest. however  it is an important problem that j u s t i f i e s further e f f o r t . in particular  an understanding of the purpose and mechanism behind overshadowing w i l l allow better control of natural language understanding programs.
