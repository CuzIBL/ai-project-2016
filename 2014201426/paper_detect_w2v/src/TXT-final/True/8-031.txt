 from the problem.  the second l e v e l corresponds to the property l i s t of the head atom. the t h i r d l e v e l corresponds to the property l i s t s of the atoms on the second l e v e l .   in our problem there is only one s t r u c t u r e . it is most

the expressions g1  g1  e t c . are symbols generated by the lisp system. they are commonly c a l l e d gensyms  and are used as f i l l e r s in the s t r u c t u r e s . 
　　　looking at the r i g h t hand node of the s t r u c ture we see that the v e l o c i t y of the ship is 1 
miles per hour  and t h i s v e l o c i t y is in the -j d i r e c t i o n .  the program assumes a right-handed co-ordinate system so -j would be west as it should be.  
　　　the f o u r t h section w i l l generate the equations which the f i n a l section w i l l s o l v e . i n t h i s problem it must change the expression  distance  ship  go1   to an a c t u a l distance equation. 
a f t e r it has done so the program p r i n t s out

 the answer is  
1. 
t h i s   of course  w i t h e i t h e r a l i t t l e thought  or a l i t t l e algebra can be shown to be the c o r r e c t answer. as a p o i n t of i n t e r e s t carps took 1 seconds of machine time to solve t h i s problem. i i . student 
　　　as we mentioned e a r l i e r bobrow's program  student  solves algebra word problems. to r e a l l y understand how student works we should go through a problem and see how the program solves i t . a t y p i c a l problem which student could solve i s : 
 the gas consumption of my car is 1 
	miles per gallon. 	if the distance 
between boston and new york is 1 
miles  what is the number of gallons 
of gas used on a trip between new york 
and boston q.  
in t h i s problem we d o n ' t have any mandatory t r a n s formations  however many of the words w i l l be tagged. 	 a t y p i c a l mandatory transformation 
would be   t w i c e   changed to  1 t i m e s   .   a f t e r the words are tagged the problem would then look l i k e : 
 the gas consumption  of/op  my/pron  
car  is/verb  1 miles per gallon 
 period/diw  if the distance between boston and new york  is/verb  1 
miles   what/qword   is/verb  the number 
 of/op  gallons  of/op  gas used on a 
trip between new york and boston  q/dim   
　　　the next s e c t i o n of the program breaks the sentences i n t o what bobrow c a l l s k e r n e l sentences. in t h i s problem the f i r s t sentence w i l l not be changed  however the second w i l l . it w i l l become   f o r the sake of convenience we w i l l drop the t a g s   : 
 the distance between boston and new 
york is 1 miles. what is the number 
of gallons of gas used on a trip between new york and boston q.  
it accomplishes t h i s by noting the   i f . . .  -/qword  . . .   c o n s t r u c t i o n and breaking the sentence i n t o the two smaller ones above. 
-1-　　　student next transforms the simple sentences i n t o equations. the general r u l e used here is 
t h a t the word   i s   is changed to an equal s i g n   and words l i k e   t i m e s       d i v i d e   are changed to t h e i r algebraic equivalents. the equation formed by a question is an e q u a l i t y between a newly c r e ated atom and the q u a n t i t y to which the question r e f e r s . our problem w i l l create the f o l l o w i n g equations: 
 equal x1  number of gallons of gas used on trip between new york 
and boston   
 equal  distance between boston and 
new york   times 1 miles    
 equal  gas consumption of my car   quotient times 1 miles    times l gallon     
with the exception of x1  the newly created v a r i a b l e   our variables come d i r e c t l y from the words of the problem  ignoring any occurrences of   a   and   t h e   . 
　　　student then t r i e s to solve t h i s set of equations and finds that it can not. it then p r i n t s 
out 
 using the following known re iat ions hips  
	  equal  distance   times 	 speed   time     
 equal  distance  times  gas consumption  
 number of gallons of gas used     
 assuming that  
  distance  is equal to  distance between 
boston and new york   
 assuming that  
  number of gallons of gas used  is equal 
to  number of gallons of gas used on trip between new york and boston   
 assuming that  
  gas consumption  is equal to  gas consumption of my car   
the equations are stored in a glossary under a key word. the f i r s t word of each v a r i a b l e is looked up in the glossary and the corresponding equations p u l l e d o u t . student then matches up the variables in the new equations w i t h the variables already in the problem. a f t e r having made these observations student again t r i e s to solve the equations  succeeds  and p r i n t s out 
equations. 
　　　the second property is in my estimation even more serious. with one exception  each kernel sentence is translated i n t o e x a c t l y one complete equation  and since student can count on i t s input always forming equations  there is no p r o v i s i o n for any other form of information storage. however  in a t y p i c a l calculus word problem we might have a sentence l i k e  a ship is t r a v e l i n g e a s t .     or 'tyater is flowing i n t o a c o n i c a l f u n n e l .   in each case there is information which should be s t o r e d   but c l e a r l y the equation form would not be the appropriate storage medium. 
       both of these c r i t i c i s m s stem d i r e c t l y from the type of problem bobrow sets out to s o l v e . there are other d i f f i c u l t i e s w i t h student which were probably l e f t unsolved because they were not c r i t i c a l to the operation of the program and the size of the program had already reached the size of the a v a i l a b l e memory. these are 1  a very l i m i t e d subset of english grammar. student cannot 
handle something as basic to english as a dependent clause. in general one must be very c a r e f u l in one's choice of sentences when addressing student. 1  a lack of sophisticated h e u r i s t i c s to determine the e q u a l i t y of variables previously considered independent. 1  a small knowledge of the   r e a l w o r l d   and a rather i n f l e x i b l e manner of 
using that knowledge. 
	i i i . 	word tagging and sentence decomposition 
       if we are to r e a l l y understand the workings of carps we should go through a problem in great d e t a i l . consider the f o l l o w i n g problem: 
 water is flowing into a conical filter at the rate of 1 cubic inches per 
	second /. 	if the radius of the base of 
the filter is 1 inches and the altitude 
is 1 inches /  find the rate at which 
the water level is rising when the volume 
is 1 cubic inches / .   


 the number of gallons of gas used on a 
trip between new york and boston is 
1 gallons  
　　　a close examination of student shows that it has some properties which make it less general than one would l i k e . the f i r s t of these is that once we have translated our sentences i n t o equat i o n s   a l l algebra word problems are a l i k e   that i s   they are a l l sets of linear equations w i t h as 
many equations as unknowns. hence  once the problem has been reduced to equation form  student does not need any h e u r i s t i c s to solve the in the f i r s t section of the program each word is checked to see if it has a property on i t s property l i s t under the i n d i c a t o r grammar. if it does  the value of t h i s property w i l l be a funct i o n which w i l l then be evaluated. the net result 
of the evaluation w i l l be one of the f o l l o w i n g : 
       1  the current word   i . e .   the word whose property l i s t we just checked  w i l l be tagged w i t h i t s part of speech. 	1  the words of the question sentence w i l l moreover be checked to see 
1-

if they give any clue as to the type of problem we are deailing w i t h . in our problem the word level  is the clue t h a t the problem is one which deals w i t h volumes. 1  a c u r r e n t word may be noted as a key word  meaning it has equations associated w i t h it in memory . the only key word occurring in our problem is conical. 1  common phrases w i l l be changed to a standard form. for example the phrases at the rate of and at the rate are changed to at rate  1  words ending in ing w i l l be labeled as verbs. 
　　　a f t e r t h i s s e c t i o n is through  our problem w i l l look l i k e t h i s : 
   water  flowing verb  {into prep  a 
	 conical adj  filter  at prep  	 rate 
rword  1  in1 unit  per  sec unit   
 1       i f the radius of the base of the 
filter  is verb  1  in unit  and the altitude  is verb  1  in unit     
 find qword   rate rword  at which the 
water level  rising verb  when the volume 
	 is verb  1  in1 unit   	  1       
　　　the next s e c t i o n of the program breaks the sentences i n t o simple sentences. since we t r e a t t h i s as a problem of p a t t e r n matching  it is 
w r i t t e n in convert. at the present moment we have sixteen rules in t h i s p a r t of the program. they cover a large p o r t i o n of compound and complex sentences. they are l i s t e d w i t h examples of t h e i r use in appendix b. 
　　　let us s t a r t w i t h the second sentence  since it is somewhat easier to explain than the f i r s t . 
the p a t t e r n which w i l l match t h i s 	is 

this r u l e is f a i r l y s t r a i g h t forward in the sense t h a t i t s p l i t s o f f the dependent clause i n t r o duced by when and makes it i n t o a separate sentence. however  in the process the when is r e -
moved from the sentence. the word when in c a l c u lus problems is almost always used to i n d i c a t e the 
boundary c o n d i t i o n . that i s   it precedes a value which should only be s u b s t i t u t e d i n t o the equat i o n s a f t e r the d i f f e r e n t i a t i o n is accomplished. in order to save t h i s information the word when is added to the tag of the second sentence created by t h i s r u l e . 
       in the same way the r e s t of the problem is broken i n t o simple sentences. our problem now 
looks l i k e  with the word tagged j u s t to remind the reader that the tags are s t i l l there  
   water  flowing verb   into prep  a  conical adj  filter   1     water

　　the r i g h t side of the r u l e s p e c i f i e s that we begin the program over  but break the sentences in two. in our case the two sentences are the radius of the base of the filter is 1 in and the 
altitude is 1 in and find rate atwhich the water level rising when the volume is 1 in. 
　　　the second sentence of these two  find the rate atwhich...  w i l l be broken by the r u l e 
question word - anything - when - anything 
iv. transformation of simple sentences into the internal model 
　　　once the sentences are s i m p l i f i e d the p r o gram goes to the t h i r d and probably most important stage. it is here that we t r a n s l a t e our simple sentences i n t o the i n t e r n a l representation of the problem   i . e . i n t o s t r u c t u r e s and equat i o n s   . this takes place in two phases. let us c a l l them a and b. the f i r s t phase i d e n t i f i e s the basic form of a sentence. a l i s t of these forms can be found in appendix c. the second 
phase f u r t h e r analyzes the sentence components recognized by phase a  e s p e c i a l l y noun phrases. a l i s t of the processes applied to noun phrases can be found in appendix d. phase b also r e l a t e s the sentences to the e n t i r e problem of which it is a p a r t . phase b concludes by f i l l i n g out the s t r u c t u r e s . the e n t i r e procedure is applied to each sentence. 
　　　upon e n t e r i n g phase a w i t h the f i r s t sentence we check if the sentence is a q u e s t i o n . in t h i s case the sentence is routed to a s p e c i a l sect i o n which deals only w i t h questions. the f i r s t sentence w i l l not match any p a t t e r n and w i l l be placed on the s p e c i a l l i s t for unmatched sen-
	tences. 	the second sentence w i l l match the 
p a t t e r n 
-1-
　　this format indicates that the object mentioned by the noun phrase is changing at a given r a t e . the r a t e is r e s t r i c t e d to time simply because a l l our problems have only time r a t e s . 
　　　we now enter phase b. it notices that in1 is a u n i t of volume  so we get the s t r u c t u r e : 

       the program now r e a l i z e s that t h i s sentence indicates volume change. by the previously unused sentence it decides that water is the contents of the conical filter. it then notes that conical is an a d j e c t i v e describing shape. then t h i s i n f o r m a t i o n   as w e l l as the contents of the f i l t e r   is put i n t o s t r u c t u r e form and we get: 

the f a c t that atoms are unique in lisp comes in very handily here. when we put water on the property l i s t of filter we are guaranteed that a l l the properties associated w i t h water  volume in t h i s case  w i l l tag along. 
the t h i r d sentence  the radius of the base 
of the filter is 1 in  w i l l match 
this indicates a value assignment. the radius of the base of the filter is changed i n t o s t r u c t u r e form  and then the v a l u e   1 i n   is tacked on. 
this gives us 

valu-.1 in 
       to understand the f o u r t h sentence  the altitude is 1 in  is handled we must backtrack somewhat. when we encountered the phrase conical filter we put c o n i c a l on the property l i s t of f i l t e r . the program knows that c o n i c a l objects 
have many properties in common. for example they a l l have a l t i t u d e s and bases  and bases have r a d i i . so these facts are put on the s t r u c t u r e of the f i l t e r . hence much of the s t r u c t u r e we have 
shown being created had already been placed in the s t r u c t u r e as a common property of cones. never the lees at each step the system a c t u a l l y d i d cre-
ate the substructure f i n d i n g   however  that the information was already on the property l i s t s . 
       there is one other operation we have so far neglected. 	every time a property x is put on the atom y  a property markeron is placed on the atom x  and t h i s has the value y. 	this gives us backwards pointers so that given a property we can f i n d out which atoms have that property. 	the 
point is that when the program checked to see if altitude was a marker on any atom  it discovered that it was on filter. the program then assumed that altitude r e f e r r e d to the a l t i t u d e of the f i l t e r   and created the sub s t r u c t u r e  a  

	a 	b 
the next sentence is the question  find rate 
atwhich the water level rising . the phrase water level becomes  b . note that carps recognizes that in t h i s context level means altitude. for a p a r t i a l l i s t of the knowledge carps has about words  see appendix e. once again water is only on the property l i s t of filter  so we can trace back and f i n d that what we are interested in is  g1 water filter . this is the equation v a r i a b l e format. this v a r i a b l e represents  in e n g l i s h   the a l t i t u d e of the contents of the f i l t e r . so we create the equation 
 equal g1  deriv g1 water filter    
       the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the last simple sentence  the volume is 1 in1  depends on the same s o r t of a n a l y s i s . the word volume only appears as a marker on water  so the program assumes the sentence is r e f e r r i n g to t h i s volume. however since the sentence tag for t h i s sentence has the word when  the s t r u c t u r e created is modif i e d as seen below in the completed s t r u c t u r e . the when on the property l i s t of water indicates that what follows beneath it is a boundary 
-1-
condition. 
　　　at this point a l l the necessary information has been extracted from the sentences  and this stage of the solution is over. the f i n a l structure is on the next page. 
v. the formation of the equations and their solution 
　　　the fourth section is concerned with establishing the equations which the f i f t h section 
w i l l manipulate to solve the problem. 
　　　there w i l l be two equations 	 other than the one already created by the question sentence . one relates the volume of the contents of a cone to the a l t i t u d e and radius  and the other relates the height and radius of our cone to the height and radius of the contents of the cone. 	to see how the stored equations are manipulated consider this equation used in the problem. 
 equal  times  radius base contents obj  
 altitude obj   
 times  altitude contents obj  
 radius base obj    
this i s the r e l a t i  s seen in the diagram on page 1 . 
       before the parameters are replaced an extra copy is set aside to be used later when we solve for the boundary condition. the program w i l l then go through the l i s t structure noting that equal and times are algebraic symbols. it w i l l then come to  radius   and note that this is 
not an algebraic symbol  implying that the l i s t of which radius is the f i r s t element is a variable name. processing the variable in reverse order  it f i r s t finds that the value of obj is filter. it then looks for the contents of filter  which is water  and then for the base of the water  which it does not find. hence it leaves this variable 
with only the last two elements replaced   e . g .    radius base water filter  . it w i l l find the a l t i t u d e of the f i l t e r however  and note that it has the property valu whose value w i l l then replace this entire expression in the equation. in this same manner the rest of the equation set 
w i l l be f i l l e d   and the computer prints out. 
 the equation set is  
1   equal 	 g1   deriv  g1 water filter    
1  equal  quotient  times 1  times 
 expt in 1  tim   sec  
	 times 	 g1 water filter  1 pi 
 expt  radius base water filter 1    
1  equal  times  radius base water filter  
	 times 	1 in   
 times  g1 water filter  
	 times 	1 i n         
in usual notation this is 


　　　at this point section four of carps is completed  and we go on to five. 
　　　in section five we f i r s t get our desired variable  in our case the altitude of water  completely in terms of time  and then differentiate to find the rate as a function of time. then the boundary condition is used to solve for time and this value is substituted into the rage equation to get our final answer. 
 the answer is  

in conventional notation this would be 

	vi. 	conclusions 
　　　in section 1 we noted several aspects of student which we felt needed further work. 	let us compare carps and student in these areas. 
1  	by storing information in terms of structures  carps is better able to recognize that two phrases describe the same object. 1  	again because of the use of structures carps can gather information about an object in piecemeal fashion. 	student was essentially required to generate one equation for each sentence in the problem description. 	in calculus word problems it is not uncommon to have two or three sentences 
providing information for one equation. 1  carps to a limited degree is able to use its knowledge to parse its input sentences. for example we saw how altitude was interpreted as altitude of the filter because carps knew that since the f i l t e r was a cone and cones have a l t i tudes  the f i l t e r had an altitude. 
1  whereas student has only one solution method   i . e .   solution of linear equations   carps has several and can decide which is appropriate for a given problem. carps machinery for solving its equations  e.g.  differentiation  simplification  is also more complex than student's. 1  carps utilizes a more sophisticated grammatical analysis of the sentences than student. this is used both in breaking up sentences and in generating the internal structures. up to now 1 problems have been solved by carps. most were taken from standard texts  sometimes with slight modifications.  variations in the statements of problems would  of course  increase the number of problems solvable by carps.  the other problems solved by carps are in appendix a. 
many of the improvements that we claim for 
carps were necessitated by the increased 
complexity of the problems that we expected it to solve. however many weaknesses of student are s t i l l present in some form in our design. 
1  an important weakness in the program is due to i t s dependence on key words to s i g n i f y the type of problem   i . e .   distance or volume  and the method of s o l u t i o n to be used. what one would l i k e to have in a calculus problem solver is a program which would use the information presented in the problem to f i g u r e out r e l a t i o n s h i p s among the e l e ments   e . g .   s i m i l a r t r i a n g l e s   and a c t u a l l y propose the method of s o l u t i o n . the answers which could be provided by such a program are c u r r e n t l y b u i l t i n t o carps' data base for several cases  but t h i s scheme severely l i m i t s the power of the program. 
1  another weakness of carps is i t s l i m i t e d knowledge of english syntax. it would not be too d i f f i c u l t for carps to learn new s y n t a c t i c rules by adding these rules to i t s convert subroutines. a c t u a l l y what would be more s a t i s f y i n g would be a d i f f e r e n t method of parsing the sentences i n t o components of s t r u c t u r e s . currently the convert rules are attempted one at a time u n t i l one 
matches the sentence. a b e t t e r approach would be an incremental l e f t to r i g h t parse which  when finished w i t h the sentence  would have.translated i t i n t o the i n t e r n a l model. 
1  a very powerful calculus word problem solver w i l l require a good deal of  common sense  knowledge. consider t h i s problem which we gave to 
carps 
 a ladder 1 ft long leans against a 
	house /. 	find the rate at which the top 
of the ladder is moving downward if its 
foot is 1 ft from the house and moving at the rate 1 ft per sec / .   
much to our surprise carps was not able to solve i t . a closer look at the problem shows why. the l a s t phrase mentions that the ladder is moving at the rate 1 ft per second. carps has  as an i n t e r n a l check  the requirement that associated with each v e l o c i t y must be the d i r e c t i o n of the veloc i t y . the p o i n t is that the problem never gave t h i s d i r e c t i o n . most people  however  would assume that it was moving h o r i z o n t a l l y away from the house. the reason of course  is that a f a m i l i a r i t y w i t h ladders or the law of g r a v i t y t e l l s us that t h i s is the most l i k e l y way for it to be 
moving. 
　　　this is not an i s o l a t e d i n c i d e n t . consider the problem 
 a barge whose deck is 1 ft below the level of a dock is being drawn in by means of a cable attached to the deck and passing through a ring on the dock. when the barge is 1 ft from and 
approaching the dock at 1 ft / sec  
how fast is the cable being pulled in    
the ship is moving h o r i z o n t a l l y towards the dock. 
-1-the problem does not mention t h i s . 
　　　nor is the need for a body of   r e a l w o r l d   information unique to calculus problems. consider an example taken from a c h i l d r e n ' s s t o r y .  mike's costume had big r u f f l e s . he refused to wear i t .   the question is  why  . a program which w i l l answer c o r r e c t l y must know that boys u s u a l l y w i l l not wear g i r l ' s c l o t h e s   and anything w i t h r u f f l e s on it must be for g i r l s . 
       it is our b e l i e f that a program which is to understand second grade s t o r i e s must have at i t s disposal a body of facts comparable to t h a t of an average seven year o l d . more g e n e r a l l y   computer understanding of any body of l i t e r a t u r e w i l l r e quire a data base s i m i l a r to that of a human reader. the major problems facing computer understanding of n a t u r a l language a r e   in our o p i n i o n   c o l l e c t i n g   s t o r i n g   and u t i l i z i n g such large bodies of i n f o r m a t i o n .

　　　problem taken from ayres  page 1. three changes were made. ship p was o r i g i n a l l y ship a  the question o r i g i n a l l y read  are they approaching or separating a f t e r 1 hr and at what r a t e     
and there were three questions. 
1  ladder 1 feet long leans against a house /. find the rate at which the top of the ladder is 
moving if its foot is 1 feet from the house 
and moving away from the house at the rate 1 
feet per second / .   
　　　taken from ayres page 1. the problem o r i g i n a l l y asked two questions. 
1  a train starting at 1 am /  travels east at 
1 miles per hour while another /  starting at 
noon from the same point /  travels south at 1 miles per hour /. how fast are they separating at 1 pm    
taken from ayres page 1  no changes. 
1  gas is escaping from a spherical balloon at 
the rate of 1 cubic feet per minute /. how fast is the surface area shrinking when the radius is 1 feet    
taken from ayres page 1  no changes. 
1  a ball is rising vertically over a point b at the rate 1 feet per second /. a point c is 
level with b and is 1 feet from b /. 	when the 
balloon is 1 feet from b /  at what rate is its 
distance from c changing    
1  upon being heated /  a metal disc expands /. 
the radius of the disk lengthens at the rate of 
.1 per sec /. 	calcuiate the rate at which the 
area of the disk is increasing when the radius is 
1 	in / .   
　　　taken from lightstone1 page 1. the problem o r i g i n a l l y had two questions and the f i r s t two sentences above were connected by the phrase   i n such a manner t h a t   . 
1  sand falls into a conical pile at the rate of 
1 ft1 per min /. 	the radius of the base of 
the pile is always equal to one half of its alti-
tude /. 	how fast is the altitude of the pile increasing when it is 1 ft deep    
taken from thomas page 1  no changes. 
1  a rectanguiar trough is 1 ft long /  1 .1 ft 
wide /  and 1 ft deep /. 	if water flows into 
the trough at the rate of 1 ft1 per min /  how 
fast is the surface of the water rising when the water is 1 ft deep    
　　　taken from ayres page 1. 	rather than wide the problem had  across the t o p     	instead of into 
the trough the problem had   i n     and instead of 
surface of the water the problem had j u s t   s u r f a c e   . 
1  a man walks away from a street light at 1 
ft per sec /. how fast is the position of the tip of his shadow changing if he is 1 feet tall /  
while it is 1 feet tall / .   
1  joe runs from a street light whose height is 
1 feet /. if joe is 1 feet tall /  and traveling at 1 miles per hour /  find the rate at 
which his shadow is lengthening    
1  the area of a sphere is increasing at the 
rate of 1 square inches per second /. 	at what 
rate is the diameter changing after 1 seconds 1
