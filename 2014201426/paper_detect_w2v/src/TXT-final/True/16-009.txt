1. introduction 
　　typical of a human dialog partner is the a b i l i t y to recognize when it is appropriate to provide more than a mere l i t e r a l   d i r e c t answer to a question and to decide what that extended response should be. hence n a t u r a l language  nl  dialog systems that are only capable of simple d i r e c t responses to users' questions w i l l necessarily be regarded as uncooperative. for t h i s reason much of the current work on cooperative nl dialog systems includes e f f o r t s to go beyond question answering  by generating extended responses. 
　　several types of extended responses have been i n v e s t i g a t e d : 
 e1  p o i n t i n g out i n c o r r e c t presuppositions   1      e1  generating u n s o l i c i t e d j u s t i f i c a t i o n s   1     
 e1  p o i n t i n g out d i s c o n t i n u i t i e s in the domain of discourse which suggest that a small change in the o r i g i n a l question would r e s u l t in a much 
	more h e l p f u l 	response   1     
 e1  o f f e r i n g to monitor' for information requested by the user as the system learns of i t   1   . 
　　in the present paper we discuss some of the semantic and pragmatic issues related to  e1  another important class of extended responses - and 
describe the evaluation and generation modules of our d i a l o g system ham-ans    which are the f i r s t such components that r e a l i z e t h i s type of response in an ai system: 
 e1  elaborating on a response to a yes-no question in order to a n t i c i p a t e obvious follow-up 
	questions of the user; 	in p a r t i c u l a r 
research on ham-ans is c u r r e n t l y being supported by the german m i n i s t r y of research and technology  bmft  under contract 1it1. 
 a  f i l l i n g o p t i o n a l deep case slots in the case frame associated w i t h a verb used in the request  cf. figs. 1 and 1   
 b  using more s p e c i f i c q u a n t i f i e r s in the answer than in the question  
 c  generating e x p l i c i t p a r t i a l answers to both parts of questions containing coordinating conjunctions. 
　　in contrast to previous ai work on extended responses of type  e1  -  e1   we w i l l describe the r e s u l t s of our research not in the computational context of nl d1 query systems  but rather in the context of a nl i n t e r f a c e to a v i s i o n system for understanding image sequences   1   . 
　　in one of the applications of our german language dialog system ham-ans  we presuppose the f o l l o w i n g s i t u a t i o n a l context: the system is observing a street i n t e r s e c t i o n and supplies on the phone the user  who is f a m i l i a r w i t h the scene but cannot see it from his remote l o c a t i o n   w i t h information about the t r a f f i c at that i n t e r s e c t i o n  cf. fig. 1 . although ham-ans is a f u l l - f l e d g e d   operational dialog system w i t h a powerful parsing component  we w i l l r e s t r i c t our presentation here to those modules of ham-ans s evaluation and generation components which are responsible for over-answering yes-no questions and necessary for v e r b a l i z i n g the r e s u l t i n g extended responses. 
1. over-answering yes-no questions 
　　extended responses to yes-no questions are answers that contain more than a p l a i n yes  or n o ' . we c a l l the process of generating extended responses that provide more s p e c i f i c or a d d i t i o n a l information ' over answering'. to make our discussion more concrete  l e t us consider the f o l l o w i n g i n t e r a c t i o n with ham-ans  cf. also fig. 1 for an a d d i t i o n a l example : 
  1   u s e r : 	has 	a 	yellow 	car 	gone 	by  
  1   ham-ans: 	yes  	one 	yellow 	one 	on 	hartungstreet. 
1 . 1 . 	providing a d d i t i o n a l case role f i l l e r s 
　　by answering as in   1     the system has in e f f e c t i n t e r p r e t e d  1  as a sort of indirect wh-question  cf.   1     which could be paraphrased: 
  1   has 	a 	yellow 	car 	gone 	by  	if 	so  	where  
　　for  1   the fact that an extended response is generated is closely r e l a t e d to the c o g n i t i v e process underlying the determination of the t r u t h value of the p r o p o s i t i o n in question  namely the v e r i f i c a t i o n of the presence of a c e r t a i n type of locomotion in the analyzed image sequence  cf. also 
f i g . 1 . note that it is impossible to v e r i f y that a yellow car has gone by' without determining the s p a t i a l l o c a t i o n of t h i s event. this means that the locative s l o t in the case frame for to go by' is f i l l e d as a side effect of the search for an answer. 
　　ham-ans's p o l i c y of r e s t r i c t i n g extended responses to information which would have had to be obtained even for a minimal d i r e c t answer is a simpl e   general strategy for keeping the cost of over-

answering w i t h i n reasonable l i m i t s   in terms of both computation and the complexity of the r e s u l t i n g utterances. like the other h e u r i s t i c s to be presented below  it may be complemented w i t h more expensive and domain-specific approaches which take the u s e r s assumed i n t e r e s t s and expectations i n t o account in the s e l e c t i o n of u n s o l i c i t a t e d information for v e r b a l i z a t i o n  see e . g .     1     . 
　　let us now consider the example given in f i g . 1 in more d e t a i l . motion concepts are represented in a s p e c i a l i z a t i o n hierarchy using the o b j e c t oriented flavor formalism   1   1 . the root f l a v o r is the motion concept to move . descendants in the t r e e   e.g. to go b y '   to t u r n     i n h e r i t the d e c l a r a t i v e and procedural i n f o r m a t i o n   instance variables and methods  r e s p e c t i v e l y   contained in t h e i r parents. the instances of a f l a v o r   e.g. turn1  denote a s p e c i f i c event in the domain of discourse. 
　　the task of checking the t r u t h value of the p r o p o s i t i o n in the question is accomplished through message passing. these messages i n c l u d e : c r e a t i n g instances of motion concepts  i n s t a n t i a t i n g deep case s l o t s s p e c i f i e d in questions  and a c t i v a t i n g appropriate methods  e.g. only agent slot filled. these methods then a c t i v a t e f u r t h e r methods which are e i t h e r owned by the f l a v o r     e . g . check 
direction change  or i n h e r i t e d from parents   e . g . find a source'  find a goal neq source  . in f i g . 1 the l a t t e r two methods must check  among other t h i n g s   whether or not the object that the agent is located on s a t i s f i e s the s e l e c t i o n r e s t r i c t i o n s of the deep case or not. this check produces an object name  which is used to f i l l the corresponding deep case s l o t . these s l o t s are then used in the formation of the extended response. 
　　in order to verbalize extended responses as i n f o r m a t i v e but concise utterances l i k e   1     hamans must e l i d e some parts of the o r i g i n a l question. this task is performed by the e l l i p s i s generation component  cf. fig- 1   which eliminates those parts of the semantic representation of complete extended answers that are i d e n t i c a l to the stored representation of the question   1   . 
1 the use of more specific q u a n t i f i e r s 
　　as a f i n a l remark on the i n t e r a c t i o n   1   -   1     l e t us point out that the i n d e f i n i t e a r t i c l e a  in  1  was replaced in  1  by the more precise q u a n t i f i e r word one'. the over-answering r u l e responsible for t h i s r e s u l t is i l l u s t r a t e d more c l e a r l y in the i n t e r a c t i o n   1   -   1   ; in which the vague several  is replaced by two : 
  1   u s e r : 	have 	several 	vehicles 	stopped 	on 
biberstreet  
 1  ham-ans: 	yes. 	two. 
　　when an e x i s t e n t i a l or numerical q u a n t i f i e r appears in a question  the corresponding q u a n t i f i e r word in the answer denotes a s p e c i f i c number. this use of precise q u a n t i f i e r words in answers w i l l usually be pragmatically a p p r o p r i a t e   since it increases the informativeness of answers without s u b s t a n t i a l l y increasing t h e i r complexity. 
　　in general  of course  increased informativeness can often be achieved only at the price of greater complexity. the complexity introduced i n t o the answer to  1  by the mention of the two streets involved is not so great as to be d i s t r a c t i n g to 

  1   u s e r : 	has a s t a t i o n wagon driven by  
  1   ham-ans: yes  	three on b i b e r s t r e e t and two on hartungstreet. 
the user  but if the f i v e s t a t i o n wagons happened to have driven on f i v e d i f f e r e n t s t r e e t s   a response which mentioned each of them would be i r r i t a t i n g l y long and tedious: 
 b  system: yes  	one 	on 	hartungstreet  	one on b i b e r s t r e e t   one on . . . 
1 	the 	informativeness-simplicity 	tradeoff 
　　in the absence of s p e c i f i c knowledge concerning the nature and amount of information desired by the user  some general h e u r i s t i c s are required to guide the system's decision when informatlvenesss i m p l i c i t y tradeoffs a r i s e . a v a r i e t y of d i f f e r e n t sets of rules for t h i s purpose are conceivable; the f o l l o w i n g set of h e u r i s t i c s   which are possible i n s t a n t i a t i o n s of the gricean maxims of quantity  has proved useful w i t h i n ham-ans: 
 hi  avoid superfluous complexity  i . e . complexity not j u s t i f i e d by any increase in informativeness. 
 h1  do not allow a c e r t a i n maximum degree of complexity to be exceeded. 
 h1  within these l i m i t s . maximize the amount of information presented. 
　　as an example  we sketch here the c r i t e r i a used in cases l i k e   1      1  and  1   i . e . when there is some nonempty set of relevant objects which s a t i s f y the predicate specified by the question's verb phrase. in general  the evaluation component w i l l have accumulated more s p e c i f i c information concerning each of these objects than that s p e c i f i e d in the o r i g i n a l predicate. to determine whether t h i s a d d i t i o n a l d e t a i l should be mentioned in the answer  the system p a r t i t i o n s the objects i n t o equivalence classes according to whether the corresponding more s p e c i f i c assertions are i d e n t i c a l . if only one or two equivalence classes r e s u l t  as in examples  1  and  1   r e s p e c t i v e l y     the a d d i t i o n a l information is mentioned in the answer. if there are more than two equivalence classes  they are not mentioned separately  and the o r i g i n a l predicate of the question is applied in the answer to a l l of the objects c o l l e c t i v e l y . 
　　the p r i n c i p l e  h1  is r e f l e c t e d here in the formation of equivalence classes  since t h i s sort of grouping can lead to a reduction in the complexity of the answer without any loss of informativeness. the maximum degree of complexity allowed  cf. r u l e h1  corresponds here to a twopart coordination such as the answer to  1 . f i n a l l y   the p o l i c y of r u l e h1 is r e f l e c t e d here in the r e p o r t i n g of the a d d i t i o n a l d e t a i l . 
　　the s p e c i f i c c r i t e r i a j u s t sketched are  of course  very narrow in scope. in ham-ans analogous c r i t e r i a are a p p l i e d   e . g . . when the question contains a coordinating conjunction  as in  1  below  cf. e1  c  above  and when it has nested q u a n t i f i e r s . 
 1  user: 	have 	a 	s t a t i o n 	wagon 	and 	a truck driven away along b i b e r s t r e e t   
 1  ham-ans: no  	one s t a t i o n wagon  	but no trucks. 
1. the generation of extended responses 
　　in t h i s section the c a p a b i l i t i e s of our implemented system are b r i e f l y i l l u s t r a t e d by some comments on a trace of the process of generation of the answer  1 . the trace  shown in fig. 1  s t a r t s a f t e r a successful parse which produces a surf representation of the input question. surf is a l i n g u i s t i c a l l y motivated d e c l a r a t i v e representation language which is used as a target and a source language by the parser and the nl generator  r e s p e c t i v e l y . the surf representation is transformed i n t o a deep r e p r e s e n t a t i o n   which is b e t t e r suited for the evaluation processes  which draw inferences on the basis of the user's utterances and derive answers to questions. the main task of t h i s transformation process is to

determine the scope of q u a n t i f i e r s  cf. figs. 1 and 1 . the p a t t e r n - d i r e c t e d evaluation component of ham-ans includes a l l of the processes for d e r i v i n g the semantic s t r u c t u r e of an extended response  as discussed in the previous section. after the deep representation of the r e s u l t i n g answer has been subjected to the inverse transformation the e l l i p s i s generation component t r i e s to reduce the s t r u c t u r e which represents the complete response. the v e r b a l i z a t i o n process uses t r a n s l a t i o n s rules attached to the various categories of surf expressions; it is thus guided d i r e c t l y by the message to be expressed rather than by the h i e r a r c h i c a l s t r u c t u r e of a grammar. the possibly e l l i p t i c a l preterminal s t r u c t u r e of the answer is mapped onto a well-formed german utterance by the surface transformation component  which uses extensive l i n g u i s t i c knowledge   c f . figs. 1 and 1 . in t h i s component  the terminal word forms are generated using morpho-syntactic properties   e . g . for number  marked in fig. 1 w i t h n:   surface case  and gender  and morphological c l a s s i f i c a t i o n schemes for the d i f f e r e n t i n f l e c t i o n a l paradigms of german nouns and verbs. the properties extracted from the preterminal s t r u c t u r e and the word lexicon are assigned to noun phrases according to rules of agreement   1   .

1. limitations and future work 
　　our current research e f f o r t s are not being concentrated on i n t e r a c t i o n s l i k e  1 - 1  and   1   -   1     where in the systems's reply the motion concept used in the questions is modified by an adverb or replaced w i t h a more s p e c i f i c one. the

 1  user: 	has 	the 	car gone 	by  
 1  system: 	yes  	it 	sped 	away. 
generation 	of answers of t h i s type would require a more elaborate evaluation strategy and the 	use 	of more knowledge sources  	e.g. 	knowledge about common sense standards   1   	1 . 
　　on the other hand the methods described can e a s i l y be extended to handle temporal adverbs. in i n t e r a c t i o n   1   -   1     the extended response i n -
dicates when the event took place. 	because the time

 1  system: 	yes  	it 	just 	did. 
of the beginning and the end of an event is recorded during the evaluation phase  we plan to provide for the generation of answers l i k e  1  using methods s i m i l a r to those described in  for the analysis of temporal d e s c r i p t i o n s .
