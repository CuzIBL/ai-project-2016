 	knowledge structure definition 

　　　this paper presents an o u t l i n e of the program ksds  knowledge structure d e f i n i t i o n system  designed for the d e f i n i t i o n of the structure of a medical knowledge base. ksds defines type and s t r u c t u r e of the elements of a conceptual net. ksds generates the i n t e r n a l structure and format of the knowledge base. nodes and r e l a t i o n s of t h i s net are structured in a uniform fashion  consisting of four p a r t s : i d e n t i f i c a t i o n   description of a t t r i b u t e s   r e l a t i o n s to concepts  and explanations. for each a t t r i b u t e there exists a l i s t of p r i m i t i v e s which r e s t r i c t s i t s type and possible values. the r e l a t i o n part is constructed referencing already defined r e l a t i o n s of the s t r u c t u r e base. if the structure is changed  ksds takes care of the re-formating of the knowledge base. the system is c u r r e n t l y being used for the d e f i n i t i o n and maintalnance of the knowledge base of an expert system in primary medical care. 
introduction 
       in the primary medical care sector  an expert consultation system for diagnosis and treatment recommendation has to face a s p e c i f i c s i t u a t i o n : in the i n i t i a l consultation the patient presents a very unapecific c o l l e c t i o n of subjective f i n d i n g s   the a v a i l a b i l i t y of diagnostic procedures is very l i m i t e d   the physician concludes a 'suspected diagnosis' usually  but he has to decide about 
correct therapy  including the decisions 'wait and do n o t h i n g '   'send patient to hospital immediately'  and 'send patient for special examination'. the system must manage follow-up v i s i t s   follow the course of disease s   and control the therapeutic effects and s i d e - e f f e c t s   perhaps revise the i n i t i a l diagnosis in the l i g h t of new manifestations and therapeutic outcomes. 
　　　the f i r s t task in primary care is to detect 'preventable dangerous courses of diseases'. therefore the possible courses of a disease  together with appropriate medical actions at each stage  and expectations about the future course have to be represented in the system. this has been aooompliahed for the r e s t r i c t e d area of glaucoma  casnet   1       but an expert system in primary medical care w i l l often face an unknown or not well known pathophysiology. 
　　　the representation of the medical knowledge should serve as a basis for the consultation system performing i t s task under the requirements mentioned above. compared to the c l i n i c a l area  it is hardly possible to include a l l facets of primary care a p r i o r i in an expert system. decisions w i l l be based e.g. on nosological  e t i o l o g i c a l   topographical  pathogenetic knowledge. we w i l l discover that some of the necessary facets are not represented a f t e r the construction of the knowledge base and a f t e r the consultation system has been completed. this fact led us to build the knowledge structure d e f i n i t i o n system ksds for easy modification and supplement of knowledge. this idea of developing systems for constructing consultation systems is also stressed by weiss and kulikowski   1   . 
　　　one p o s s i b i l i t y would be to represent knowledge in rules l i k e mycin   1   . however  defining e x p l i c i t hierarchies for the topography of diseases and for abnormal function of physiological systems is extremely d i f f i c u l t . a d d i t i o n a l l y   reggia  reported the inadequacy of the rule-based approach for his neurological l o c a l i z a t i o n problem. 
　　　we designed our knowledge base as a net s t r u c t u r e   bearing in mind the design p r i n c i p l e s of casnet   1     internist   1   1     pip   1     abel   1     and centaur   1     
　　　medical knowledge is represented in a conceptual net. we have defined four d i f f e r e n t concepts up to now: 
- manifestations  
- diseases  
- diagnostic procedures  and - therapeutic procedures. 
　　　ksds represents concepts as nodes connected by r e l a t i o n s . nodes and r e l a t i o n s are represented in the same format  compare f i g s . 1 and 1   . their description in ksds consists of four p a r t s : 
       1. the d e f i n i t i o n part   f i r s t two lines of f i g s . 1 and 1  contains 
- an unambigous i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of the node or r e l a t i o n {1}  
- the name of the defined entry {1}  and 
- if it is a r e l a t i o n : the type of the nodes connected   1   1   .

　　　1. the descriptive part declares the a t t r i b u t e s of the node or r e l a t i o n  'descriptors' in f i g s . 1 and 1   . it is similar to the notion of s l o t s in the frame terminology. the descriptive part for a r e l a t i o n contains values associated with t h i s r e l a t i o n   e.g. strength  preference  consequences  expectations using the r e l a t i o n . thus  figure 1 shows of the r e l a t i o n 'perform therapeutic procedure'  connecting a 'disease'with a 'therapeutic procedure'-node. 
	besides the name and 	a 	c l a s s i f i c a t i o n 	code 
 icd  snomed   the descriptive part of a node contains items l i k e r i s k   duration  frequency. figure 1 shows the complete d e f i n i t i o n of the node 
'therapeutic procedure'. the information for each of the descriptors consists of the name of the descriptor {1}  i t s abbreviation {1}  value  1  and default value {1}. a d d i t i o n a l l y   information about the i n t e r n a l structure created by ksds is displayed   l e n g t h   p o s i t i o n   . the value determines a group from a l i s t of allowed p r i m i t i v e s   f i g . 1 : p r i m i t i v e s of the group 'types of therapeutic procedures  t.type '   defined p r i o r to the d e f i n i t i o n of the concept. the default value w i l l be used  if the expert w i l l not gr 	el 	abbrev 	name

supply a value f i l l i n g the concept. the usage of p r i m i t i v e - l i s t s allows the checking of plausible values as well as the d e f i n i t i o n of a t t r i b u t e s in natural language. 
       1. the r e l a t i o n part defines a l l relations s t a r t i n g at t h i s concept. figure 1 shows the defined r e l a t i o n s for the node 'therapeutic procedure'. the length and to-node are taken from the description and d e f i n i t i o n part of the r e l a t i o n d e f i n i t i o n in ksds.

       1. the explanation part contains comments on the defined concept and detailed informations for the expert entering new knowledge. it can be used to support a natural language conversation. 
example 
　　　the following example shows a 'therapeutic procedure'-node in the knowledge base: 
1 term of procedure: 	immobilization of affected limb 
1 c l a s s i f i c a t i o n code: 	1 
1 type of procedure: 	physiotherapy 
1 risk: 	minimal 
1 cost: low 
1 p r e s c r i p t i o n : surgical dressing  bandages  
c a s t s     usually 1 weeks 
1 time lag a f t e r becoming e f f e c t i v e : 	immediately 
1 maximal number of r e p e t i t i o n s : 1 
the element is connected to others by the following r e l a t i o n s : 
1  is a possible therapy for disease  
 sprain and s t r a i n of supportive structures  1  
	  1   d i s l o c a t i o n of j o i n t 	 1  
 fracture  1  
 cutanous and subcutanous i n f e c t i o n  1  
 burn  1  
 s u p e r f i c i a l 	i n j u r y 	 1  
1 c o n t r a i n d i c a t i o n 	  i n c l . a l l e r g y     
 phlebothrombosis  1  
1 str : strong 
1  side effect  manifestation  : 
  1   hypersensitivity reaction to dressing mat. 
     1 exp : rarely  pressure sore 
1 exp : rarely 
 1j disuse atrophy 
1 exp : rarely 
explanations for the node  immobilization of affected l i m b   : 
the dressing should stay on s i t e u n t i l the schedule follow-up contact. in case of pain and/ or swelling an e a r l i e r r e v i s i o n is indicated. 
concluding remarks 
　　　the advantages of the knowlegde structure d e f i n i t i o n system are: 
- there exists an e x p l i c i t and v i s i b l e d e f i n i t i o n of the knowledge s t r u c t u r e ; 
- this structure can be modified i n t e r a c t i v e l y ; 
- the internal representation is determined and controlled by the ksds; 
- modifications in the knowledge structure can be performed easily on already e x i s t i n g knowledge bases. the ksds w i l l automatically restructure the e x i s t i n g knowledge base; 
- the system for acquisition of knowledge from experts and consistency checking can use substructures of the net activated for a specific task   e . g . entering information about r e l a t i o n s between manifestations and diseases ; 
- the procedural knowledge of the consultation system w i l l be defined as operations on t h i s knowledge s t r u c t u r e   e x p l i c i t l y showing the concepts  descriptors and r e l a t i o n s used; 
- this w i l l be of extreme importance defining executers to perform specific tasks during a consultation  e.g. activate diseases indicated by topographical r e l a t i o n s as hypotheses  determine possible treatments  check contraindications  e t c .   . only one or very few tasks w i l l be active at one moment  corresponding to the standard procedure of a physician in primary care   t r y to find answers to the following questions:  what is the complaint     what does t h i s refer t o        what should be considered     possible causes     what course is expected     do's and d o n ' t ' s       . propagation in the net w i l l be r e s t r i c t e d by using only very few r e l a t i o n s when 
	performing one 	task. this 	w i l l 	 hopefully  prevent 	combinatorial e f f o r t ; explosion 	of 	search - one c r i t e r i o n for 	our consultation 	system 	is 	conceptual 	adequacy. presumably  	the 	newly 	defined executers 	w i l l perform 	more 	poorly compared to the performance of a physician. stepwise modifications of the executers w i l l hopefully increase performance. since an executer shows the net structure it uses  modification can be done more e a s i l y .
