introduction 
　our a b i l i t y to cope with the environment is the result of continual learninn from experience. learnina  makes sense  onlv because situations resemble each other  and some information obtained in one situation is of use in others - or  expressed more broadly  similar situations c a l l for similar actions. we also learn to extract the essential characteristic features of the situations we become familiar w i t h   which then help us in r e t r i e v i n a the situations most similar to the one we are faced with. 
　s i m i l a r i t y can be of d i f f e r e n t types and at d i f f e r e n t levels of complexity. i t s discovery is often the result of a goal oriented process associated with problem solving a c t i v i t y . once s i m i l a r i t y betxween a problem with a known solution and an unsolved problem has been recognized  analogical reasoning  ar  is normally called into action by humans to generate possible solutions to be tested then for adequacy. 
　we have attempted to investigate alt detached from specific tasks and to formulate i t s general p r i n c i p l e s . our objective has been to create an ar component for problem solving proarams and to assume for it the level of generality the means-ends analysis 
was shown to have in gps. working hypotheses of analogical reasoning 
　the underlying rationale of1- ar can be expressed by a few working hypotheses: 
    i  each problem is describable as an  ordered  collection of  possibly overlapping  features.  a feature represents one or several chunked properties. whereas properties are atomic and d i r e c t l y measurable  features can in general be measured as present or absent only.  the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n and extraction of features are  however  l e f t either to a program component external to ar or to the user. 
    ii  solutions are associated with r e spective problems in a well-defined  det e r m i n i s t i c manner. this assumption goes beyond the usual concept of causality. it requires that the features be i d e n t i f i a b l e and strongly enough correlated with the solutions so that the l a t t e r can be derived d i r e c t l y from the former. 
     i i i   in the task domains of interest to us  similar problems have similar solut i o n s .  similarity must be measured along certain dimensions that depend on a p r i o r i features of both problems and solutions.  
　 iv  when two problems have similar sol u t i o n s   the features present in one pro-
blem but not in the other are l i k e l y to be of lesser importance. in t u r n   features shared by problems which have similar solutions are l i k e l y to be important. these can be strengthened quantitatively the

more problems  which have similar solutions  share a feature the more important it is l i k e l y to be. also  the more features are shared by two problems the more similar their solutions w i l l be. 
the contributive and hierarchical models 
　a decision must be made as to what i n formation should be extracted from  raw  experience with problems and solutions  and how this information should be used in dettermining solutions to new problems. in the contributive model  the features of a problem are associated with the appropriate solution steps or segments. the frequency of prior usage of a solution segment for problems with a given feature provides a 
　heuristic auide in selecting and ordering for testing that solution segment for a new 
problem possessing the same feature. 
　the hierarchical model also considers the relevance of individual features. the solution segments offered for testing are selected in an order based on matching with a set of features hierarchically structured in the knowledge base. the learning process hore not only enters new information about problems  their features and sequence of solution seaments  as above  but it may also rearrange the feature hierarchy. 
　we feel some combination of the above two models can deal also with high order simil a r i t i e s - such as theorems of d u a l i t y   s t r u c t u r a l   semantic  functional and thematic s i m i l a r i t i e s - if sophisticated feature extraction programs can be employed in cooperation with the ar component. 
progra iried explorations 
　f i r s t   we carried out a few preliminary experiements with simple tasks. these i n cluded the contributive model for the  simulation  of some piece-wise smooth functions and the hierarchical model for several concent formation tasks. 
　we have then implemented a simplified system consistina of three main components: the f i r s t ornanizes and coordinates the loaic of problem solvina and is responsible for sub-problem generation. the second is the task-independent ar component offering recommendations to the previous one. f i n a l l y   a data base separate from the rest contains the task domain description  the procedures to interpret the semantics of the definitions used  and a l i s t of a l l possible features. this system was used for two areas s u f f i c i e n t l y d i s j o i n t for generality consinderations but having identical machine representation of problem constituents - theorem proving and construction tasks in plane geometry. 
　the objective was to prove that ar works with n o n - t r i v i a l problems rather than to compete with previous impressive accomplishments in the above areas. we were also able to show that the knowledge acq u i s i t i o n system is both effective and eff i c i e n t . new concepts  such as c i r c l e   can be introduced on-line  in a high-level manner. the system is f l e x i b l e   open ended and capable of accepting extensions.
