 
this paper presents a new approach to inductive learning that combines aspects of instancebased learning and rule induction in a single simple algorithm the rise system searches for rules in a specific-to-general fashion  starting with one rule per training example  and avoids some of the difficulties of separate-andeonquer approaches by evaluating each proposed induction step globally  le   through an efficient procedure that is equivalent to checking the accuracy of the rule set as a whole on every training example classification is performed using a best-match strategy  and reduces to nearest-neighbor if all generalizations of instances were rejected an extensive empirical study shows that rise consistently achieves higher accuracies than state-of-the-art representatives of its  parent  paradigms  pebls and cn1   and also outperforms a decision-tree learner  c1  in 1 out of 1 test domains  in 1 with 1% confidence  
1 	introduction 
several well-developed approaches to inductive learning currently exist  among them induction of decision trees  qumlan  1a   rule induction  clark and niblett  1   and instance-based learning  aha el al   1  while accuracy in many practical domains is still far from 1%  it is unclear how much  if any  improvement is still possible with current methods empirical studies have also shown repeatedly that each approach works best in some  but not all  domains  this has been termed the selective superiority problem  brodley  1  ideally  we would like to have an algorithm that in each domain of interest performs as well as the best of the algorithms above  or better while it is now clearly understood that induction is a  zero-sum game   and thus this goal is unachievable for the set of all mathematically possi ble domains  schaffer 1   it may well be possible to produce learners that perform better on a wide variety of real-world domains  at the cost of worse performance in domains that never occur in practice one way to attempt this is by combining two or more of the basic approaches into an algorithm that will behave as the most appropriate of them in each situation this line of research may be termed  empirical multi-strategy learning   michalski and tecuc  1  mcs  brodley  1   kbnge  wettschereck  1  and itrule  smyth et al  1  are examples of systems of this type 
　two induction paradigms with largely complementary strengths and weaknesses are rule induction and instance-based learning  ibl  rule induction systems often succeed in identifying small sets of highly predictive features  and can make effective use of statistical measures to combat noise however  they can only form axis-parallel frontiers in the instance space  and they have trouble recognizing exceptions  or in general small  low-frequency sections of the space  this is known as the small disjuncts problem  holte et al  1  further  their general-to-specific   separate and conquer  search 
strategy causes them to suffer from the splintering prob lem as induction progresses the amount of data left for further learning dwindles rapidly  leading to wrong decisions or insufficient specialization due to lark of adequate statistical support on the other hand  ibl  also known as nearest-neighbor  methods can form complex  non axis-parallel frontiers  and are well suited to handling exceptions  but can be very vulnerable to noise and irrelevant features 
　this paper describes an approach to induction that attempts to overcome each of these methods' limitations by combining it with the other the approach is implemented in the rise system unlike many other empirical multi-strategy systems  rise does not consist of a global procedure calling the different algorithms as eubprocedures  but rather of a single  simple algorithm that can behave both as a nearest-neighbor classifier and a rule induction system ilence its being termed a  unified  approach  instead of a 'combined  one  many other unification schemes are of course possible 
　the next section presents the rise algorithm  followed by the derivation of an upper bound for its time complexity an empirical study is then reported  comparing rise and several other systems on 1 domains from the uci repository  and the results are interpreted finally  related work is discussed  and some directions for future research are outlined

sic step of the cn1 and aq rule induction algorithms takes o eas  time plus a logarithmic term where s is a user-set parameter related to the width of the search this step is embedded in loops that may run up to o ea  timesh yielding a worst-case total time in excess of 1 e1s  rise's worst-case complexity is thus competitive with that of standard rule induction algorithms 
　the introduction of numeric values simply increases the values above by a factor of vn  since the single step removal of a condition may now be replaced by at most o   v n   steps of expanding the corresponding interval in practice only a 1mall number of step1 may actually be required

in order to verify if rise's expected benefits are observed in practice  experiments were carried out on 1 datasete from the uci repository  murphy and aha 1  half of the domains were first used to select a default version of rise by 1-fold cross-validation the domains used in this phase were breast cancer  credit screening  crx   chess endgames  kr-vs-kp   pima diabetes  hepatitis  iris  labor negotiations  lung canter  liver disease  contact lenses  lymphography  primary tumor  soybean  small   voting records  and wine the version of rise thus selected is the one described in previous sections rise was then compared with state-of-theart representatives of other approaches on the remaining 1 domains pebls 1 for ibl  cost and salzberg  1   cn1 1 for rule induction  clark and boswell  1   and c1 for induction of decision trees  quinlan  1a  pebls 1 l's inability to deal with missing values was overcome by grafting onto it an approach similar to the one used by rise  and numeric values were discretized as directed in the manual c1rules  the version of c1 that converts trees to rules  was chosen because rules have been observed to achieve the highest accuracies  quinlan  1   and because they are more directly comparable to rise the default classifier  which assigns all tesl examples to the most frequent class  was also included in the study to provide a baseline 
　the default versions of all algorithms were used this ensures a fair comparison rise is tested on domains for which it was not fine-tuned  and its default version is compared with other default versions  if anything  this procedure is unfavorable to rise  because the test suite includes domains which were used in the development of the other algorithms  as reported in the
