 
this paper investigates  several methods tor coping with inconsistency caused by multiple source information bv introducing suitable consequence relations capable of interring non treival conclusions from an inconsistent stratified knowledge base some of these methods presuppose a revision step namely a selection of one or several consistent subsets ot formulas and then classical inference is used for inferring from these subsets two alternative methods that do not require any revision step arc studied inference based on arguments and   new approach called saftly supported inference where inconsistency is kept local these two last methods look suitable when the inconsistency is due to the presence of several sources of information the paper offers a 
comparative study of the various inference modes under inconsisiency 
1 	introduction 
inconsistency can be encountered in different reasoning tasks in particular 
- when reasoning with exception-tolerant generic knowledge where the knowledge base includes default rules and insinuated facts and later a new information is received that contradicts a plausible conclusion derived from the previous knowledge base 
¡¡in abduclive reasoning lor instance in model-based diagnosis when observations conflict with the normal functioning mode of the system and the hypothesis that the components of the system are working well this leads to diagnose what components  fail s  
- when several consistent knowledge bases pertaining to the same domain but coming from n different experts are available for instance each expert is a reliable specialist in some aspect of the concerned domain but less reliable on other aspects a siraightlorward way of building a global base    is to concatenate the knowledge bases k1  provided by each expert even if k1 is consistent it is rather unlikely that k i   k 1 - ' u k n will be consistent also 
¡¡this paper is primarily oriented towards the treatment of inconsistency caused by the use of multiple sources of information knowledge bases considered in this paper are all stratified  namely each formula in the knowledge base is associated with its level of certainty corresponding to the layer to which it belongs the use ol priorities among formulas has been shown to be very important to appropriately revise inconsistent knowledge bases  fagin et a l   1  in particular  gardenfors  1  has proved that any revision process that satisfies natural requirement is implicitly based on priority ordering in the context ot merging several knowledge bases the introduction of priorities between pieces of information in x can be explained by the two following scenarios - each consistent knowledge base k  issued from a source of information is flat'  i e without any priority between their elements  but we have a total pre-ordenng between the sources ol information according to their reliability in this case merging different sources of information lead to a pnonti ed knowledge base ¡ê where the certainty level of each lormula reflects the reliability of the source a particular case is when each piece of information in ¡ê is supported by a different source 
- all sources of intormation are equally reliable  and thus have the same level of reliability   but inside each consistent knowledge base k  there exists a preference relation between pieces or information given by an expert who rank-orders them according to their level of certainly here again the combination of the different sources of information gives an uncertain knowledge base provided that the scales of uncertainly used in each knowledge base k  are commensurate 
¡¡tins paper investigates two classes of approaches to deal with inconsistency in knowledge bases coherence theories and foundation theories somewhat departing from what is usually considered we view this dichotomy in the following way these two classes correspond to two alutudes in front of inconsistent knowledge one  the coherence theories  insists on revising the knowledge base and restoring consistency the other  the foundation theories  accepts inconsistency and copes with it coherence theories propose to give up some formulas of knowledge base in order lo gel one or several consistent subbases of z and to apply classical entailment on these consistent subbases lo deduce plausible conclusions of the knowledge hase foundation theories proceed differently since ihey retain all available information but each plausible conclusion inferred from the knowledge base is justified by some strong reason for believing in it such reasons are based on the idea of argument that goes hack lo toulmin  1   and is related to previous proposals by poole  1  pollock  1  and siman and lous  1  which were however suggebled in the framework of defeasible reasoning for handling exceptions there also exist approaches lo reasoning with inconsistent knowledge bases which for instance identify a consistent part and an inconsistent part in the base as in  lin 1   or which combine the consequences obtained from each source of information as in  dubois et al 1b  rather than combining the knowledge bases attached to each source before the inference process takes place 
our dichotomy coherence versus foundation is somewhat

1 	conclusion 
it does not always make sense to revise an inconsistent knowledge base in the case of multiple sources of information revision always comes down lo destroying part of the knowledge this paper suggests that it is not even necessary to restore consistency in order to make sensible inferences from an inconsistent knowledge base the argumentation inference can derive conclusions with reasons lo believe them  t is not conservative it is reasonably syntax-dependenl and it does not inhibit pieces of information the safely supported inference proposed here only delivers safe conclusions while the other argued consequences are more debatable since an} three of them can be globally inconsistent  bcnterhal et al 1  because based on antagonistic arguments ot course the a n d property is lost and this is the price paid tor living in an inconsistent world however the set of safely supported consequences is consistent and it is possible lo close it deductively as shown in benlcrhai cl al  1  what is then obtained by this deductive closure is the set of possibilistic consequences ol ¡Æ=tree ¡Æ   u free ¡Æn  which bhows an example where a coherence approach is more adventurous than a foundation one
