 
¡¡¡¡¡¡a comparison is made between a very frequent type of error in aphasia   sequential errors  involving a pair of identical linguistic units  like phonemes or graphemes  and the behavioural 
 failures  of a cybernetic system: sarf. the structure of the sequential errors is explicated  and rules for describing them are given b r i e f l y . the similarity between these errors  and the errors made by an independently constructed cybernetic system  sarf  is shown. the conditions of a correct comparison between sarf behaviour and the language production of aphasic people are examined. hypotheses are inferred about the functional structure of brain mechanisms responsible for both abnormal and normal integration and seriation of asemantic units in language production; these hypotheses have led to new e v i dence at other levels of language.
