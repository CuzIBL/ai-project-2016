 
　　　　a l e a r n i n g system is described which was used to c o n t r o l a simple robot v e h i c l e and to autonomously l e a r n behaviour p a t t e r n s . the system is loosely based on becker's model of intermediate c o g n i t i o n . 
	i 	introduction 
　　　　there are a number of reasons to regard sensory-motor l e a r n i n g as a basis f o r i n t e l l i g e n c e   and t h e r e f o r e to be of g r e a t e r i n t e r e s t than other forms of l e a r n i n g . 	our l e a r n i n g system took becker's model of intermediate cognition as i t s s t a r t i n g p o i n t and developed and modified it cons i d e r a b l y : 	becker 	  l   	himself d i d not implement h i s model. 	mott  has c r i t i c i s e d becker's o r i g i n a l model. 	further d e t a i l s of t h i s work can be found in  and   1   . 	we used a simple but r e a l robot v e h i c l e   the queen mary college mark iv experimental robot. 	it had a set of sensors i n c l u d i n g touch bars on a l l four s i d e s   p h o t o c e l l s p o i n t i n g i n f r o n t o f the v e h i c l e and b a t t e r y l e v e l sensors. 	the robot had a number of other sensors that were not used in t h i s work. 	the program was 
w r i t t e n in pop-1 and ran on an icl 1s mainframe computer. 
	ii 	the schema model 
kernels 
　　　　the system accepted a stream of atomic sensory 	  k e r n e l s   
 bright s from p h o t o c e l l s  front s from the f r o n t touch bar  full s b a t t e r y f u l l y charged  hunger s b a t t e r y low  low s b a t t e r y very low or overcharged 
  hunger s also produced in t h i s case   charge s b a t t e r y on charge  high s  used i n t e r n a l l y but not produced by sensing any p h y s i c a l s i t u a t i o n 　　　　this research was supported by a two-year grant from the united kingdom science research c o u n c i l . 
it generated a stream of motor kernels 
 forw m 	few inches forward 
 back m 	  	backward 
 left m 	1 degrees r o t a t i o n l e f t   	about centre 
 right m 	  	r i g h t

b. short 	term 	memory 	and 	events 
　　　　the stream of sensory and motor kernels f l o w ed i n t o an i n f i n i t e l y long queue or stm. the system operated on a d i s c r e t e time s c a l e   s t r i c t l y a l t e r n a t i n g between motor output and sensory i n p u t . an item in the queue was the set of k e r n e l s occurr i n g at one t i m e   which were thus e i t h e r a l l sensory or a l l motor k e r n e l s . a set of k e r n e l s o c c u r r i n g at a given time s l o t was c a l l e d an event e . g . e={ charge s  front s . an event could be empty. the contents of stm were an event sequence 
e . g . e 1 -- e 1 -- -- e 1 where temporal adjacency is denoted by  -  . 
c. 	schemas and the model 
　　　　the c e n t r a l data s t r u c t u r e was the system's model of the w o r l d   which was an unordered set of  schema . a schema was of the form 
            event sequence ＊  event sequence  where  =   means   p r e d i c t s the occurrence o f   
　　　　if the l e f t hand side of a schema matched the contents of stm  it was said to occur and the model p r e d i c t e d t h a t the r i g h t hand side would occur  s t a r t i n g i n the next time s l o t . 
　　　　the schema were u n c e r t a i n   w i t h each kernel having a c e r t a i n t y value f o r i t s membership of the schema  and each schema having an o v e r a l l c e r t a i n t y value of g i v i n g a c o r r e c t d e s c r i p t i o n of what happens in stm. 
	i l l 	prediction and behaviour 
1 　　　　we regarded p r e d i c t i o n and behaviour as separate processes. p r e d i c t i o n was the bottom up generation of s t r i n g s of events s t a r t i n g from the contents of stm and using the model. instead of producing a p r e d i c t i o n t r e e   it was found easier to v e r i f y p r e d i c t i o n s if they were amalgamated i n t o a 
l i n e a r p r e d i c t i o n queue. 	t h i s was s t r i c t l y timed 
w i t h time s l o t s . 	p r e d i c t i o n s had c e r t a i n t y values obtained by m u l t i p l y i n g the c e r t a i n t y values of items i n v o l v e d i n t h e i r c r e a t i o n . 
　　　　behaviour was goal seeking if a  low s or  high s was p r e d i c t e d   otherwise it was e x p l o r a t o r y . 
goal seeking behaviour t r i e d to achieve  high s in stm and avoid  low s in stm. it d i d t h i s by s e t t i n g up a goal t r e e top down from a predicted  high s or  low s as top g o a l . the subgoals were obtained by chaining back using schemas from the model and each subgoal had a s t r i c t time of desired occurrence. goals also had p r i o r i t i e s derived from c e r t a i n t y v a l u e s . 
　　　　negated kernels were found to be u s e f u l . a negated k e r n e l - a  was put i n t o stm if a goal  a  f a i l e d to occur. the avoidance of  low  was expressed as s e t t i n g a-i low  top g o a l . the r u l e s f o r matching negated kernels were s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d   since negation meant the absence of t h a t k e r n e l . 
　　　　a goal succeeded if it was a sensory kernel and t h i s sensory kernel occurred in the corresponding time s l o t . 	i f i t was a motor k e r n e l   	i t succeeded by the system o u t p u t t i n g t h a t kernel and causing an e x t e r n a l a c t i o n of the r o b o t . 
　　　　exploratory behaviour i n v o l v e d executing any motor kernels involved i n p r e d i c t i o n s . 
	iv 	learning 
this occurred in three ways 
	1. 	schema c r e a t i o n 
　　　　if unpredicted kernels occurred in stm  a new schema was created using these kernels as rhs and the kernels from c u r r e n t time -1 and -1 as the l h s : 
time 	c t - 1 	c t - 1 	ct 
stm 	 a s b s 	 m m 	 c s d s 
new schema 	  a s b s 	--  m m 	    c s d s  w i t h i n i t i a l c e r t a i n t y values o f 	1. 
1 . 	updating c e r t a i n t y values i n e x i s t i n g schema 
　　　　if a schema p a r t i a l l y matched stm  the c e r t a i n t y values were updated. t h i s was o n l y done i f a l l but one o f the l h s kernels d o match and i f at l e a s t one of the r h s kernels matched and the average u n c e r t a i n t y of any k e r n e l s not matching was less than a t h r e s h o l d   1 . 1   . 
　　　　the c e r t a i n t y values were c a l c u l a t e d in an ad hoc manner as f o l l o w s : 
l h s kernels   k   : no of times k absent and p r e d i c t i o n f a i l e d 
no of times k absent and p r e d i c t i o n f a i l e d o r succeeded 
rhs k e r n e l s   k   : no of times p r e d i c t i o n of k o v e r a l l c e r t a i n t y : succeeded no of times k p r e d i c t e d 
1hs 	c o n t r i b + rhs c o n t r i b   
i 
where lhs c o n t r i b * .. .. x modi l h s   k   
 no of times k absent/1  and rhs c o n t r i b = .  . v modi rhs k   no of times p r e d i c t i o n of rhs succeeded/1  where modi x  ＊ if x l then x else 1. 
	1. 	d i f f e r e n t i a t i o n 
　　　　if the c e r t a i n t y value of rhs tended to a s t a b l e value which was n e i t h e r 1 nor 1  	t h i s i n d i c a t e d an i n s u f f i c i e n t l y s p e c i f i e d c o n t e x t   and e x t r a d e t a i l could be added from i t s occurrence in stm. 
　　　　thus if   a s--  b m =  os  and i f 
 x s- - y m-ka s-* b m-*' c s occurs then the schema is d i f f e r e n t i a t e d to   x s+ y m-ka s-* b m=  c s

	 	hi example of learning 
　　　　an example of l e a r n t behaviour was   l e a r n i n g to f i n d the l i g h t and charge the b a t t e r i e s   when hungry . 
　　　　the system s t a r t e d w i t h o n l y one   i n n a t e   schema v i z . 
  front s-+ forw m=  high s  
i . e . 	it had a tendency to push against o b j e c t s in contact w i t h and i n 	f r o n t o f i t . 
　　　　i t 	l e a r n t   hunger s-+ 	*  hunger s  
i . e . 	hunger tends to p e r s i s t 
  hunger s--  	=  l1w s  
i . e . 	hunger tends to 	 eventually  	produce p a i n .   right m 	=  bright s  t h i s i s scanning behaviour i . e . 	i f you t u r n o r 
 scan  r i g h t   you sometimes see the l i g h t   bright s-=  forw m =  bright s  t h i s is l i g h t beam f o l l o w i n g i . e . if you see the l i g h t and move forwards  you o f t e n s t i l l see the l i g h t . 
  charge s--  forw m = -i hunger s  t h i s i s d i s c r i m i n a t i n g pushing i . e . 	i f you are o n charge and push forwards you may e v e n t u a l l y a l l e v i a t e 	hunger. 
in f a c t the system  also l e a r n t the more 
complex 	form
