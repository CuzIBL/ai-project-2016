 there are f i v e sorts of answers 　　　this paper describes an expert-system  e.s.  for automatic econometric modelling. the aim of the system is to b u i l d a set of econometric equations on a data base. the s p e c i f i c a t i o n s of the 
economic 	r e l a t i o n s h i p s are made e x p l i c i t in a 
knowledge-based system in lisp. so the e.s. has 
two components 	: 	the f i r s t is an economic problem 
s o l v i n g one  the second is a s t a t i s t i c a l and economic component. a t h i r d component which w i l l i n t e r p r e t the econometric test of the s t a t i s t i c a l 
c o r r e l a t i o n s and give economic explanation is envisaged . 
	i 	introduction        1. these about the general c a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the production f u n c t i o n and the strategy followed 
by the user. for instance the manufacturing sector  the p e r i o d i c i t y   the beginning date of the data  
and so on. 
       1. these asking f o r documentation. at any time it is possible to obtain more information and even 
b i b l i o g r a p h i c documentation. 
       1. these about explanation : the system can e x p l a i n why it asked a q u e s t i o n   what is t h i s knowledge  and how it learned such and such a f a c t . so it has the complete a b i l i t y to provide explanations for i t s behavior and knowledge. 
　　　the expert-system described here is designed to provide assistance in the task of b u i l d i n g eco-
nometric models  roos  1 . the aim of the system is to b u i l d a set of equations which would 
help to e x p l a i n and c a l c u l a t e the factors of the aggregate demand for a manufacturing sector. the e.s. has two components : the f i r s t   w i t h a capac i t y f o r reasoning  t r a n s f e r s his knowledge to the user and asks questions about the given problem. it works w i t h if-then production rules in the sameway as the usual expert-systems   l a u r i e r e   1 . the second  works w i t h an econometric s o f t ware and a data base. it uses parameters issued by the f i r s t component to estimate a set of equat i o n s . 
ii the problem-solving-side 
a. 	the question-answering overview 
　　　this economic problem-solving component runs around a frame which represents the whole i n f o r mation of a production f u n c t i o n . this frame has for elements the objects of the e.s.  there are 1 objects : the general c a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the f u n c t i o n   the labor f a c t o r   the c a p i t a l f a c t o r   investment and index of capacity u t i l i s a t i o n . every object has a t t r i b u t e s and every a t t r i b u t e has values  pinson  1 . at the beginning of the session a l l the values are at nil  at each nil value the  inference engine  a c t i v a t e s a c a l l function for a q u e s t i o n . the answers are accepted in french n a t u r a l language  of course it is not r e a l l y a n a t u r a l language but the s y n t a c t i c and semantic analyser can recognize the probable meaning of the answers . 
　　　1. the order to q u i t the session. 
　　　1. a correct answer to the question : it is a new f a c t . 
　　　if the system don't understand the answer  it ask again the q u e s t i o n . 
b. the 	inference engine 
       the answer to the question is put in a fact base. at each new fact the rules are invoked. the search strategy is simply a forward c h a i n i n g . 	if a l l 	the premises of a rule are in the 	fact base  the rule is a p p l i e d   and a set of new f a c t s   	the then part of the r u l e   	is inserted i n t o the 	fact base. the rules are again invoked and the process continues u n t i l no applicable rules are found. the rules are not p r o b a b i l i s t and a l l 	the 	rules where the premises are r i g h t are a p p l i e d . 
　　　when a new fact is added to the f a c t base  it is analysed  and it modifies the frame. there is a 
new search for the next nil value of the frame. when a l l values are placed in the frame the e.s. makes a parameter f i l e f o r the econometric estimat i o n . 
　　　then the second part  the economectric p a r t   is c a l l e d . before the e.s. t e l l s the user the fact it has learned. 
c. the rules and meta-rules 
　　　in an extented version which w i l l t r e a t a 
　　　l a r g e r part of the macro-economic theory there w i l l 

j.-l roos 1 
be a number of meta-rules to define the domain of 

search. in this simple version there are few metarules : a few to define the user's strategy   i f the user searches for production function limited to labor  there w i l l be no question about capital !     and a few to recognize if a new fact is correct in the context of the previous fact. 
　　　there are thus two types of rules : the error-rules  1 rules  which are invoked each time and applied if a fact is incorrect and the addedfact-rules  ao rules  invoked only if no error rules are applied. 
　　　when the user answers at a question with a new fact this last is tested with the error-rules to see if it is consistent with the others facts in the fact-base. if not  the error is explained  the last fact is destroyed and the system asks again for the question. else the last fact is put in the fact base and the added-fact-rules are i n voked. 
i l l the econometric side 
　　　the econometric component contains about a 
　　　thousand forms of econometric estimations. it is 
made with a tsf  time series processor  program which runs on the 1 version. there are a lot of econometric program which are called according to the parameters issued from the f i r s t part. a set 
of equations are so evalued from the data base. 
　　　the system can evalue econometric equations for labor  two equations can be estimated if there is a productivity cycle   investment  capital  and sometimes for index of capacity utilisation. so a production function can have 1 equations which are economic consistent : they accept capital - labor substitution  putty-putty   fixed proportion  clayclay  or fixed proportion ex-post with new capital  putty-clay   phelps  1 . 
　　　the estimations are done with ordinary least square or almon procedure for quarterly data. the all system is represented in figure 1. actually a complete session with econometric estimation takes about 1 minutes. a micro version w i l l be implemented in apple ii soon with prolog.
