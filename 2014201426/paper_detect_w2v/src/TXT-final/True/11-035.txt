ion. in principle it only needs to flow in one direction and can be implemented by production rules. in the event that the system is operating in a sufficiently restricted domain  
i . e .   one in which a l l data patterns are uniquely predefined  then the highest level structure w i l l be the unique interpretation. however  r e a l i s t i c domains are not like this and  in general  the intermediate descriptive structures w i l l contain ambiguities and multiple possibilities. these ambiguities multiply across the levels of abstraction and eventually lead to many possible f i n a l descriptions. 
　　　to reduce these ambiguities  a second kind of information flow-feedback-is necessary. 	conceptually  this allows information to move both horizontally 'across a l l positions at a single level of abstraction and vertically across a l l levels of abstraction at a single projected position. 	diagonal kinds of feedback  which flow across both position and level of abstraction  can be expressed in terms of these two orthogonal flows. 
1. relaxation processes for dot labeling and grouping 
　　　feedback can be implemented uniformly in both directions by relaxation labeling processes  rlps . these are p a r a l l e l   iterative schemes for using consistency or compatibility relationships to reduce local ambiguities. in order to apply rlps to dot labeling and grouping  a hierarchical arrangement of two horizontal rlps and one vertical rlp must be defined. one horizontal process attempts to disambiguate the assignment of functional labels from the set {edge  interior  noise} onto individual dots. it iterates toward horizontal   i . e .   spatial  consistency between the labels attached to neighboring dots. the second horizontal process performs the grouping operation by labeling the links between dots as either connected or notconnected. the vertical rlp allows interactions between the link labels and the dot labels. it iterates toward descriptions which are consistent across both levels of abstraction.  for example  a 
connected link is consistent with two neighboring 
interior dots.  
1. conclusions 
　　　experiments with this rlp system for labeling and grouping dots have revealed a number of conclusions relevant to the design of more complex systems. 
 1  the conceptualization of vision systems in terms of levels of description and processes that operate across and between levels provides a 
framework in which many different systems can be compared with one another. for example  given this basis  an essential difference can be seen between shirai's context-sensitive line finder and marr's primal sketch. in shirai's system the feedback is across widely separated levels of abstraction while in marr's system the feedback is 
more local because it is restricted to more adjacent levels. since  from a systems-theoretic viewpoint  local feedback is often sufficient for noise reduction  the existence of stable  independent modules becomes a possibility. furthermore  the lack of generality in systems such as shirai's might be counterbalanced by introducing more local forms of feedback. 
 1  the strategy selected for scheduling individual processes can have a drastic effect on the system's overall performance. in particular  l e t ting the horizontal and vertical processes run simultaneously rather than alternately w i l l   under certain conditions  allow the system to converge rather than o s c i l l a t e . since a l l large systems  e.g. hearsay-ii  contain a scheduling mechanism for coping with f i n i t e resources  this mechanism 
must be designed with regard to total system performance. a unifying conceptual structure could certainly f a c i l i t a t e this design. 
 1  the cooperative/competitive nature of the computations described eliminates the need for  best-first  attention-focusing mechanisms. with the many local processes operating in p a r a l l e l   distinct a c t i v i t y only appears to take place around well-defined positions  or levels ; in ambiguous situations the various processes counteract each other's effects. the net effect is that a c t i v i t y is focused i m p l i c i t l y - there is no need to define an e x p l i c i t  typically heuristic  rule.
