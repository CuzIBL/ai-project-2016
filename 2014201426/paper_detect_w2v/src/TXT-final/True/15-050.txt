 
　　　a method is proposed for automatic diagnosis of a dynamic system. it basically uses only the knowledge on system description and does not require any knowledge concerning f a i l u r e causality. the diagnosis consists of the four steps: expectation value computation  suspects computation  suspects discrimination using observable data and suspects discrimination by test generation. linear input resolution is used with e x p l i c i t metalevel control. this method can diagnose in principle a l l kinds of f a i l u r e s that are l o g i c a l l y diagnosable if the system description is appropriate. the capabili t y of the method is demonstrated by an application example of a nuclear reactor feed-water system. 
	i 	introduction 
　　　well established approach of i d e n t i fying the cause of anomaly in a dynamically changing system is to use the preanalyzed scenario of event propagation. a typical example is disturbance analysis system  das  based on cause-consequence tree  cct  cmeijer and frogner  1. das has useful pre-alarming and diagnosis capabilities that can cover a variety of forseen circumstances. i t s efficiency comes from i t s use of a set of e x p l i c i t l y enumerated f a u l t s but building a cct that covers almost a l l possible f a u l t s is a complicated and d i f f i c u l t task. 
　　　new approach has recently been proposed u t i l i z i n g the knowledge engineering technique  nelson  1cunderwood  1 cchandrasekaran  1. application of this technique to plant diagnosis offers the following advantages: 
1  complex phenomena that propagate through various plant components can be represented in terms of logical event chains. 
1  the diagnostic a b i l i t y can be easily imporved by modification of the knowledge base. 
1  it can explain i t s line of reasoning in reaching a conclusion. 
1  knowhows that are heuristic and have been accumulated through experts' experiences can be u t i l i z e d in problem solving. 
　　　this approach d i f f e r s from the above in that it does not require e x p l i c i t enumeration of each scenario  but it s t i l l requires cause-result relationship as a piece of knowledge. in this regards  what is not expressed in this knowledge is out of scope of diagnosis. 
　　　another approach that has also recently been proposed is to use the knowledge about system description  i.e. intended structure and expected behavior. application of this technique to computer hardware diagnosis showed i t s capability of solving the problem without requiring causality relationship cgenesereth  1 and 1 cdavis e t c .   1. 
　　　this paper introduces an attempt to extend this technique to a diagnositic problem of a dynamic system that has feedback loops. the advantages l i s t e d above also apply to this approach. 
	ii 	diagnosis problem 
　　　the problem to be solved is simply stated as follows: 
cgiven a symptom indicating anomaly of some observable signal from some detector at some time  i d e n t i f y a f a u l t y component or components of a plant that caused the observable symptom.1 
　　　the main differences of this diagnosis from that of computer hardware are: 
1  the system is dynamic  i . e . the observable signals are time dependent. 
1  the system forms feedback loops  i . e . inputs of some components are affected by outputs of themselves as well as of other components with some time lag. 

1  many 	of 	the 	important 	signals 	are observable. 
1  some of the 	important 	components 	are redundant. 
　　　although the form of test generation is l i m i t e d   there s t i l l are ways to do i t   thereby focusing a suspect component. 
	i l l 	system description 
　　　the method described here expects as data a f u l l description of a plant to be analyzed. the degree of s o p h i s t i f i c a t i o n of behavior description is determined by i t s capability of distinguishing a normal state from an abnormal state. the knowledge representation used for system description is based on mrs cgenesereth  1. i t s syntax is same as that of predicate calculus. 
a. 	structure description 
　　　the structure of a system is specif i e d by describing components  interconnections and states. 
	1. 	component description 
　　　each component is deisgnated by an atomic name and i t s type is specified by type statement. three examples are given below. 
 type a sensor   type b selector  
 type c pump  
	1. 	connectivity description 
　　　each component has zero or more inputs and outputs. connectivity r e l a t i o n ship among components is specified by conn statement. one example is given below. 
 conn  output 1 c   input 1 a   
	1. 	state description 
　　　some components need information about their states. this information refers to on/off state  observability  redundancy  swithcing condition  e t c . . four examples are given below. 
 value  input 1 a  on  
 observable  value  output i b       
 redundant c d  
	 swltchable  value 	 input i b       
b. 	behavior description 
　　　the behavior of a system is specified by describing the relationship between i t s input s  and output s  of each component in terms of rules. behavior of a component in a dynamic system is usually described by a d i f f e r e n t i a l equation  which is often discretized to a set of arithmetic expressions. 
	1. 	dynamics description 
　　　the rules relating input s  to output s  are denoted as forward behavior rules  fb rules  and these relating output s  to input s  as backward behavior rules  bb rules . simulation of the system behavior requests use of the fb rules but inference requests use of both rules. use of the bb rules is encountered in i n f e r r i n g unobervable input s  to a component from observable output s  of sensor s . 
	a. 	forward behavior rules 
　　　two examples are given. the f i r s t is a sensor behavior and the second a cont r o l l e r behavior. ok means that a component is not f a u l t y . symbols starting with $ mean that these are variables. the statement  true a b  means that a is true in situation b. 
　　　the f i r s t rule says that the sensor is a two-input  one-output device  one input being an on/off switch and the other sensing a quantity mi  and that if the sensor is on and functioning normally  the output mo is mi/mr  where mr is a scale factor. this is true for every t. the second rule is more complicated. the output of the controller mo at time t is computed by a function f that requires 1 variables  one of which is the output mi i t s e l f at the previous time step s. in these rules meta-knowledge is used to 
determine 	where to perform numeric compu-
t a t i o n . 
  i f  type $x sensor  
  i f  and  ok $x  
 value  input 1 $x  on  
 true  value  input 1 $x  $mi  $t  
 value  rated $x  $mr  
 = $mo  / $ml $mr

	iv 	method of diagnosis 
　　　the diagnosis consists of the following four steps. 
a. 	computation of expectation value 
　　　start of diagnosis is an interpretat i o n that the symptom does not match the expectation. it i s   therefore  necessary to estimate the expected value of the sensor where an anomaly is detected. to do t h i s   plant dynamics has to be simulated s t a r t i n g from some i n i t i a l state. it is not necessary to go back to a state where a l l components were normal because the input and output relationship of a normal component is consistent regardless of the value of i t s input s . it is s u f f i c i e n t   in a dynamic system having feedback loops  to go back at least to the time t-1a and use a set of consistent observable data  where t is the time of anomaly detection and a is the maximum difference of time for input s  of any component to affect output!s  of any other component including i t s e l f in solving the dynamics by time 
d i s c r e t i z a t i o n . 
　　　inference is made in two steps. f i r s t   forward chaining is applied to obtain unobservable data at time t-1 s t a r t i n g from the observable da♀a at time 
n. yamada and h. motoda 1 
t-1 using the structure data  bb and bc rules assuming a l l components are normal. next  forward chaining is applied to obtain the expectation value of the anomaly detected sensor at time t starting from the estimated unobservable data using the structure data  fb and fc rules. 
b. 	computation of suspects 
　　　using the fact that the symptom is against the expectation  a l l components that can logically be responsible for the symptom are picked up as suspects. linear input resolution is applied starting from the expectation v i o l a t i o n at time t u n t i l it reaches the estimated unobservable data at time t-1/  using the structure data  fb and fc rules. a l l rules are converted to conjunctive normal form. 
c. 	discrimination of the suspects using observable data 
　　　it is possible to discriminate the suspects by checking the consistency of the available observable data. here  consistency means that the observed output s  can be expected from the observed input s  using the knowledge on system description. the knowledge required in this step is the structure data  fb  bb  fc and bc rules. 
　　　inference is made in two steps. f i r s t   a set of observable data required to i d e n t i f y the anomaly of one or more components is searched. symbolic simulation is performed by resolution starting from the fb rule of any one of the suspect candidates. because the feedback nature of the system necessitates concurrent use of both forward and backward rules  inference should be controlled to avoid to get into an i n f i n i t e loop. in fig. 1  for example  s t a r t i n g the resolution from the component c  the sensors s i   
s1 	and 	s1 are picked up as the data that 


1 n. yamada and h. motoda 
can be used to i d e n t i f y anomaly in the components c  d and e. the sensors themselves can also be suspects in this case. this process is repeated u n t i l a l l suspects are grouped into smaller sets. next  numeric simulation is performed for each set again using resolution to sheck if the observable data are consistent to 
each other. if they are not consistent  at least one of the components for that set is f a u l t y . 
d. discrimination of the suspects by generating tests 
　　　it is possible to further discriminate the suspects by placing single f a u l t 
and non-intermittency assumptions for each set if a meaningful test can be generated and if it is successful. use of the redundant component or valve open/close can be a realizable test in a plant disgnosis. 
　　　inference is made in two steps. f i r s t   test form is generated. the knowledge required and the inference procedure used in this step are the same as in iv c. figure 1 is an example of a set of suspects in which a test is possible. 

v application to a diagnosis of a nuclear reactor power plant 
　　　the above method is applied to a simp l i f i e d model of feed-water system of a b o i l i n g water reactor shown in fig. 1. steam going out of the core is returned to the core by the feed-water pump after 
being condensed to water. small f r a c t i o n of the vapor is used to drive a turbinedriven feed-water pump. the power level is controlled by recirculation flow rate. the 
water level is kept constant by the cont r o l l e r which uses signals from water level sensor  feed-water flow meter and main steam flow meter. the condensor is assumed to serve as a source and a sink of water and vapor. the system dynamics are  thus  determined by those of the core  the controller and the pumps. the water level sensor 1  s1  and 1  s1   and the turbine-driven  j  and motor-driven  l  pumps are redundant components. in the normal operating condition  s1 and j are used. when s1 is used  s1 is not observable. 
　　　the following hypothetical situation is assumed. the component s1 happened to 

the components c and d are redundant. assume that the component c has been selected. the suspects at t h i s stage are a  b  c and e. if there is s t i l l inconsistency among the data when the selector 
e is switched from c to d  the compponent c is exonerated from the suspects. otherwise  the component c is f a u l t y . the resolution starts from the redundant component d which is selected by the knowledge that c and d are redundant  the selector e is switchable and now c is selected  and is continued u n t i l the test form is obtained. similar test can be generated in case of valve control. next  numeric simulation is performed using resolution  and the simulated results is evaluated against the observable data. 

f a i l . the anomaly was f i r s t detected by the alarm signal of s1 at the feed-water pump outlet during a load following operation in which the plant was not in a steady state. by the time of detection  the anomaly had already propagated through various components and affected many sensor outputs although they were s t i l l within their allowable ranges except for 
s1. 

       a l l of the above d i a g n o s i s steps are automated. to improve the e f f i c i e n c y   h e u r i s t i c knowledge is a l s o employed and used t o g e t h e r w i t h the knowledge on system d e s c r i p t i o n . an example is a knowledge t h a t i t i s w o r t h t o s t a r t r e s o l u t i o n from the redundant component in d i s c r i m i n a t i n g the suspects u s i n g the observable d a t a .
