　　　a computer program that achieves the interpretation of line drawings as polyhedral scenes without using specific object prototypes is described. the method is primarily based on general coherence rules that the orientations of the surfaces and edges must satisfy  thereby dispensing with predetermined interpretations of particular categories of picture junctions as corners. the paper also comments on the relationship of this program to four other scene analysis programs. 
1. introduction 
　　　one way to capture the meaning of pictures is to investigate the relationship between two domains: the picture and whatever it is that is depicted - the scene1. this paper closely examines that relationship for pictures consisting of straight line segments and scenes made up of opaque polyhedra. a program  poly  in the same t r a d i t i o n as guzman's see1 and clowes' obscene1 is presented. poly exploits the relationship between the domains and also coherence rules that entities in the scene domain must satisfy. following a description of poly some feasible extensions to this scheme are described. finally  the relevance of this program to other scene analysis programs is discussed. 
　　　the work reported here stemmed from consideration of several unsatisfactory aspects of obscene. the 'predicate table' embodied in that program appears to be a r i g i d and opaque theory of three-surface corners and the picture-taking process. secondly  obscsfe has a very weak grip on the consistency of the viewing direction. f i n a l l y   it interprets many pictures as polyhedra which cannot  in fact  e x i s t . the conceptual framework for poly was inspired by huffman's 'dual-graph1'  which was presented as a device for checking an interpretation provided by the huffmanclowes labelling process. 
1. scene coherence 
　　　let us f i r s t establish a representation for the geometry of polyhedra and the picture taking process. 
dual space 
　　　in conventional cartesian space we describe a point by giving i t s coordinates  x y z  and a plane by a constraint upon the coordinates of a point: a. x + a. y +a z +1 
	x 	y 	z 
the representation is as it were point oriented. since planes are of more interest to us than points in the context of planarfaced polyhedra  it is desirable to use a rejiresentation that is plane oriented. such a representation is dual space1 in which a 
plane i s represented as a point - specifically by the coefficients a   a   a of the variables in the equation of the ' r e a l ' plane. it follows that the dual of a point  x y z  is a plane such that  a   a   a   is on the 
plane if xav + ya 	+ zax + k. = 1. x 	y 	z 
　　　if a line in real space is construed as the intersection of two real planes then i t s dual is the line passing through the points in dual space which repiresent those real 
planes. 
viewpoint 
　　　a two-dimensional image of a threedimensional body is a projection whose form can be specified in terms of a viewing position and a picture plane. 
　　　p i g . l i l l u s t r a t e s such a situation where the picture plane is the x-y plane and the viewpoint v is on the z axis. if we consider a particular line such as p1 then p1  b1  the corresponding edge  and v a l l l i e in a plane. this plane we c a l l the plane of interprctation i  of p1 since given p1 in 
a picture we have only to hypothesise the position of v relative to that picture to achieve a powerful constraint upon the possible interpretations of p1 as an edge  
namely that the edge l i e s in the plane i 
beyond p1 . such an hypothesis about v  has global implications for it determines the planes of interpretation for a l l other picture lines simultaneously because a l l planes of interpretation must pass through v. this fact is expressed elegantly in the dual space as the assertion that the duals of a l l the inter-
pretation planes must l i e on the dual of v 
namely on a plane in the dual space d. 
　　　if v is at i n f i n i t y relative to the picture  an ideal point  the projection is orthographic otherwise it is perspective. 
bodies 
　　　the interpretation of some set of picture lines as edges bounding a plane surface of a body is expressed in dual space as the requirement that the duals of these edges a l l pass through the dual point representing that surface. hidden edges of a p a r t i a l l y visible surface would of course also be subjected to 
t h i s requirement as would the dual of any line presumed to be upon the surface. 
1 　　　the interpretation of a picture junction as the corner of a polyhedron can also be usef u l l y characterised in dual space. 	a point in real space can be construed as the intersection 
of a set of planes so that we can i d e n t i f y the planes with the surfaces of the corner and the point w i t h the corner i t s e l f . each edge of the corner is then the line of i n t e r section of a pair of planes  and has as i t s dual a line which passes through the dual  point  of each of the pair of planes. this set of dual lines forms a polygon lying in a plane in d  that plane which is the dual of the point in real space that we identified with the corner. thus the dual of an nsurface corner of a polyhedron is a plane n-gon. 
　　　　assumptions that the objects in the portrayed three-dimensional situations are polyhedra interface with a model of viewpoint in a p a r t i c u l a r l y simple way. both the picture line and the edge it depicts l i e in the plane of i n t e r p r e t a t i o n   i  f o r that l i n e . thus the dual of the edge  a line in d  must pass through the dual of i. this can be combined 
w i t h the requirement that the dual of an edge pass through the duals of the surfaces it belongs t o   to obtain the requirement that the duals of i and the two surfaces intersecting in i l i e on the dual of the edge which is that intersection. thus in f i g . l the duals of the surfaces b1 b1 and the plane of i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of p1 a l l l i e on the dual l i n e of b1. 
the gradient space. 
　　　　a p a r t i c u l a r l y interesting 1-d subspace of the duai space d is the gradient  space g. a point  a  a  a } in d corresponds to the 
	  	x y 	z 
point 	
in g. 	geometrically  t h i s corresponds to 
projecting  ax ay'as  int ＜ the az ~  *  p ane with centre or projection at 1 and using  1 1  as the o r i g i n   1q  of g. 	tn pig.1  i in d is projected into i 	in g. 
u 
　　　　several interesting remarks can be made about g. if the equation of the pj ane is r e -
w r i t t e n as 

called the gradient of the plane. in f i g . l   -z is the distance from the point   x   y   z j on a surface of the object such as b1b♀b1 to the picture plane  z = 1. the gradient represents the vector rate of change of t h i s distance with respect to movement in the picture plane  that i s   

the length of the vector from 1q to a point  w  in g is the tangent of the angle between the picture plane and the plane corresponding to w; the d i r e c t i o n of that vector is the d i r e c t i o n of the dip of the plane corresponding to w r e l a t i v e to the picture plane. since the dual of the picture plane is the ideal point on the a - a x i s   op the zero gradient  corresponds to i t . the projection into the gradient space of the dual line representing an edge may be called the gradient line of that edge. a perpendicular dropped from cg to that line is the gradient of that edge in that its direction and mag-
nitude are the direction and tangent of the angle of dip oi' that edge relative to the picture plane. a family of mutually parallel planes represented by the coordinates  ka  ka  ka   in d will have coincident representations/ ′ a -  .  - -    ＊    
 . x    1    m g. planes which are a 	a 
	z 	1 
steeply inclined to the picture plane will be relatively remote from 1g in g. 	most of the relationships that were shown to hold in d 
must necessarily hold in g. in particular  the gradients of the interpretation plane and the two object surfaces that intersect in  an edge must be on the gradient line of that edge. 
　　　　the orientation of a picture line determines the direction of the grad ient of its interpretation plane in g. thus a picture line which is parallel to the y-axis  say  will have an interpretation plane whose gradient i  lies on the a axis. if we align the x-y  picture   axes with the a -a axes of g the directionof ig relative to 1g will 
be perpendicular to the picture line. 
　　　　the above remarks ar.v all true regardless oi' the viewing posi t ion  v  and so are true for both orthographic and perspective pictures. we shall now concern ourselves with the gradient space for' orthographic 
pictures. the duals oi' all the interpretation planes  which must lie on the duai of v  ivill then be on the a -＊ 1 plane of d. projecting the;ii into g wi llztbere'f oru put all their gradients at infinity  they become ideal points in the gradient space . another way of looking at it is to realize that as v  goes 
further from the picture plane the angles between the picture and the interpretation planes all approach 1＜ and so the lengths oi' the gradients approach tan 1   -*1 . 
　　　　the distance of !  from 1   increases with the  presumed  distance in real space of the viewing point v from the picture plane. the projection onto g of the dual of the edge depicted by the picture line  wi j !. be a line passing through i . for any picture line there is an infinite family of such lines in g being the projection onto g oi' duals of the possible edfes depicted by tht: line. as v tends to infinity  the picture tends to an orthographic projection of the scene and 1  tends to an ideal point. the family of edge gradient lines in g simultaneously tends toward a set oi' parallel lines whose orientation is that of the direction of iq.  that is  perpendicular to the picture line. 
1 　　　　consider an orthographic picture of a scene with a visible edge joining two visible surfaces  a and b.  we call such an edge  a 
　　　　'connect' edge . the gradient space configuration corresponding to that consists oi' the two gradients  g  and gg  joined by a line which is the projection of the dual of the edge. that line is perpendicular to the picture line if the gradient space is superimposed on the picture space as described above. moreover  it can easily be shown that if the gradients are ordered on the dual line in the same direction as the corresponding surfaces appear at the edgethen that edge is 
convex but if they are ordered in the reverse direction then it is concave.  intuitively  imagine a convex edge then rotate one of the surfaces until the edge becomes concave. when the edge is flat  the gradients must coincide . this crucial fact allows the exploitation of the gradient space for convex/ concave interpretations. 
　　　　as a simple example of the use of this consider a fork junction  fig. 1  where it is 
known that all the edges are connect. the configuration of the gradients of surfaces  a  b and c   g.  gbi and g   can only take on one of the two forms' of fig.hif they are to satisfy the requirement that the mutual 
vector difference be perpendicular to the line depicting the edge that connects the two surfaces. these configurations can  of course  be translated and expanded in the gradient 
space and still satisfy the requirement. comparing the relative positions of the gradients in fig.u a  with the ordering of the regions in the picture shows that all the edges must 
be convex for1 that interpretation while for the interpretation given by fig.u b  all the edges must be concave. that switch of interpretations which can be achieved by mapping every gradient g into its negation  -g  is known in the literature of psychology as the necker reversal. 
-	＊	' 	description jsf  t he program 
　　　　the task for poly can be specified as follows: using these constraints on the coherent interpretation of polyhedra subjected to this picture-taking process what information can be derived from the picture  in particular  the program must provide easily accessible answers to questions  such as  
which edges are connect edges  
which of those are convex  which concave  
which edges are occluding  
if an edge is occluding which surface is in front  
how much of the hidden structure of the scene can be recovered  
what is the orientation of each surface and each edge  
and so on. 
a program  poly  will now be described which recovers these attributes and relationships of the scene. poly is an existence proof that such questions can be answered. it does not purport to be a stand alone scene analysis program but it can be thought of as a useful embodiment of most of the knowledge specific to these picture and scene domains and their interrelationship that a scene-based problem solver would need to have available. the overall structure of poly is shown in fig.1. the program is written in algol 1 extended to allow for the representation and manipulation of data objects  attributes and binary relationships. the input is obtained by drawing a picture on the graphical display; 
'the input phase passes to the parsing phase 
uhe end points of the lines. 	the parsing 
phase recovers the picture structure by examining the lines for join relationships  and establishing the junctions and closures and the regions made up of closures. the picture structure is that given in fig.1 a . then the scene correspondents of this data structure are created following the relation of representation1as shown in fig.1 b . 
　　　　the connect part of the program uses the rules of coherence sketched earlier to establish which edges are connect and which are not. this part of the program searches over a binary tree with each level representing a different edge in the scene  the left branches being connectfedge  = true and the right branches connect edge  = false. this tree is not searched in either of the conventional depth-first or breadth-first ways. to achieve the most connected interpretation first  the top level goal requires all edges to be connected and then  when that fails  all edges but one and so on. the tree search is effected by the usual backtracking method with state saving which in this case is achieved by a recursive procedure. the edges are not searched in random order; starting from the 
background region each region is interpreted in turn: 	the next region chosen is that 
uninterpreted region with the most lines adjacent to the interpreted regions. in this context  to interpret a region means to fix the position of the corresponding surface in gradient space. because the region selected by that criterion will correspond to the most constrained surface  this strategy results in the most efficient search. so  in fact  the order of the search is given in advance by the parser but there is no reason why the 
program could not modify the order of search dynamically if it were embedded in a larger system that could supply advice or hypotheses about the orientation of particular surfaces or the status of various edges. 
　　　　a simple example will make the workings of contact clearer. consider the picture in fig.1- connect fails to find any interpretation with five or with four connect edges for reasons that will become obvious. so with the goal of establishing three connect edges  connect starts with the background a  and for convenience sets g   at the origin in gradient space  it then examines the lines on the inner closure of a  1  1  it- and 1  and finds that none of the regions on the other sides of those lines have been interpreted so it can say nothing yet about these lines. it then chooses the uninterpreted region that 
has the most adjacencies to the interpreted regions as the next region to interpret. the ordering of the edges as a tree is determined by this strategy of addressing the picture. both b and c have two adjacencies so the choice is arbitrary  say  b. now it examines lines on the outer closure of b in sequence trying to establish connect edges. say it looks at 1 first. it establishes it as a connect edge which means that gr must lie on a line perpendicular to 1 through g. = 1 . 
1 　　　　in general the position of a gradient is defined by the intersection of two or more l i nes in the gradient space arising from edges assigned connect status; however  for the first two gradients  aa and gb  here  there is no iosb of generality if we do not use that requirement to locate them since the origin and scale of the gradient space can  be subsequently altered. so we put gb at unit distance from g  on that line. the next picture line to e considered is 1  which connect also tries to establish as a connect edge but this would require gb to lie on a line perpendicular to 1 through g. which is incompatible with the current interpretation of gr  thus the interpretation in which both 
1 ana 1 are connect edges is said to be incoherent. this makes it clear why connect 
failed in its original goal of establishing all the edges as connect edges. 1 is established as an occluding edge and connect looks next at 1* since the region on the other side c  is not yet interpreted  it says nothing about 1. the remaining region c is then interpreted. 1 is established as a connect edge requiring g  to lie on a line perpendicular to 1 passing through g . the actual position of 1  is established by defining its relationship to q by making 1 or 1  but not both  connect edges. the interpretation in which 1  1 and 1 are connect and 
1 and 1+ are occluding edges is rejected by the single rule that three non-collinear points in space  the corners a  b and c  cannot simultaneously lie on two planes  a and b . so one legal connect interpretation is that 1  1 and 1 arc connect edges while 1 and 1 are not. continued search of the tree 
v.rill only yield one moreinterpretation with 1 connect edges  vis. 1  1 and 1 connect  1 and occluding. for 1  1 and 1 connect the final gradient space configuration will be as shown in fig.s  in which the gradient line of connect edge 1 is labelled as 1' etc. 
　　　　then vexcave takes over and decides which of the connect edges arc convex and which concave. vexcave starts by partit-
ioning the gradient space graph into 1-con-
nccted subgraphs1' using the gradient lines of connect edges as arcs. for each subgraph vexcave then determines its two possible interpretations using the ordering rule for gradients. 	in the example  vexcave will decide in the interpretation for which 1  1 and 1  are connect edges that the whole graph is 1-cdnnected and that either 1 and 1 are 
concave edges while 1 is convex or 1 and 1 
are convex while 1 is concave. note that  for the latter interpretation  junction b is assigned an 'accidental' status. 
　　　　finally  occlude looks at the non-connect edges and uses two inference rules to achieve a complete interpretation. the first rule expresses the fact that if two surfaces intersect in a connect edgethat is known to be  say  convex then at any position in the picture it will be apparent which surface is in front. using this rule it becomes clear  for many occluding edges  which surface  of the two that it apparently bounds  the edge actually belongs to. the rule also adds a hidden surface attached to that edge. the fact that such a surface is both turned away from the viewing direction and obscured by the visible surface means that it obeys the same constraint as it would if the edge were concave and connect. this rule is used in the example to decide for the case where 1 and 1 are concave and 1 is convex that occluding edges 1 and 1 belong to surfaces b and c respectively. the second rule for occlusion completes the polygon of gradients corresponding to the visible and hidden surfaces meeting at each corner. it does this by allowing for the hidden surfaces created by the first rule and introducing the minimum number of extra hidden surfaces required. the minimum number is achieved by allowing two occluding edges to share the same hidden surface wherever possible. in the example the second rule confirms that the polygon of gradients is complete for corner c since the surfaces at that corner  a  b and c are all 
 visible and there are no occluding edges. for corner d it completes the polygon by introducing a hidden edge between the hidden surface at edge 1 and the background. similarly for corner a and the hidden surface at edge 1. then at corner b it decides that those two hidden surfaces could be the same surface  d  and still obey the constraints. so the final gradient space configuration is fig.1 which looks like a picture of a wireframe tetrahedron because the tetrahedron is 'only self-dual polyhedron1. 
　　　　the interpretation pursued in the example above is one of the first produced by poly but the program will continue to generate less connected interpretations. for example  the tetrahedron separate from the background surface has only one connect edge  1'  but its gradient space configuration has the same structure as fig.1 with the exception that q. in that figure is replaced by the gradient 1 a second hidden surface  ge and ga is now an isolated point in gradient space. interpretations such as this with complete bodies separate from the background can be easily generated first by giving connect the advice that all the lines on the inner closure of the frame represent non-connect edges. 
　　　　when occlude has finished then the interpretation process is complete. each edge in the scene data structure is related to other scene entities such as the surfaces it bounds and the corners which bound it. an edge node also contains attributes such as connect  convex  concave or occluding and its slope relative to the picture plane. nodes 
for the original visible surfaces and the hidden surfaces introduced by occlude contain the gradient vectors which are relative to the gradient of some other surface  usually the background. these gradients may be 
uniformly scaled by a positive number before being added to the gradient of that other surface to obtain the true gradient. the scale factor must be positive because the work 
done by occlude on the hidden surfaces will not survive the necker transformation that a negative scale factor would involve. this transformation was allowed for earlier  in vexcave  when two versions of the configuration were generated. 
1 　　　　two further points about the program should be made. first  poly has no difficulty in making sense of cracks as in fig.1. cracks are simply connect edges where the two adjacent surfaces have identical gradients. finally  the processing time required to produce the first interpretation is proportional to the number of picture lines if that interpretation is completely connected but that tends towards an exponential

1. 	possible extensions 	of poly 
       there are many possible e l a b o r a t i o n s of t h i s scheme. since surfaces are represented 
by t h e i r g r a d i e n t s we l e a r n only the 
o r i e n t a t i o n of each surface and not 	i t s 
p o s i t i o n i n space. 	i t 	i s c l e a r   	however  t h a t one could take the 	r e s u l t s of poly and 
by f i x i n g the a c t u a l p o s i t i o n of one surface propagate the p o s i t i o n s of the other surfaces through the connect edges. a l t e r n a t i v e l y one could use the dual space i t s e l f as a represen t a t i o n and b u i l d a program t h a t d i r e c t l y e x p l o i t e d the c o n s t r a i n t s o u t l i n e d above. such a program would not have the conceptual s i m p l i c i t y of the implemented scheme. 
       in t h e o r y   poly only considers o r t h o graphic p r o j e c t i o n s but 	t h i s 	i s n o t   	i n p r a c t i c e   	a s i g n i f i c a n t l i m i t a t i o n on a scene a n a l y s i s program. 	however  	one could r e f o r m -
u l a t e the program to deal w i t h p e r s p e c t i v e p r o j e c t i o n . in o u t l i n e   t h i s means that the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n plane is now represented as a 
r e a l p o i n t i n g r a d i e n t space since i t i s n o t   i n g e n e r a l   perpendicular t o the p i c t u r e

i n t e r p r e t a t i o n o f the l i n e d r a w i n g . 
       if the scene is l i t by one or more d i s c r e t e l i g h t sources the boundaries of the shadows cast arc d e p i c t e d as s t r a i g h t l i n e s . consider a shadow plane formed by the l i g h t source  a shadow-casting edge and the c o r r e s ponding shadow boundary. the g r a d i e n t of such a plane must l i e on the g r a d i e n t l i n e of the edge  which is p e r p e n d i c u l a r to the p i c t u r e l i n e and c o n t a i n s the g r a d i e n t s of the two o b j e c t surfaces meeting at the edge . the shadow boundary w i l l also have a gradient l i n e which contains the g r a d i e n t s of the shadow-receiving surface and the shadow p l a n e . 
 moreover  f o r a source producing a p a r a l l e l beam the g r a d i e n t s of a l l the shadow planes must l i e on a s t r a i g h t l i n e in g r a d i e n t space t h a t i s perpendicular t o the d i r e c t i o n o f i l l u m i n a t i o n i n the p i c t u r e . such c o n s t r a i n t s allow the extension of the scheme to i n c l u d e shadow interpretation.

       walta 1 considerably extended the huffman-clowes l a b e l l i n g procedure by subd i v i d i n g the f o u r c a t e g o r i e s of edge types and adding cracks and shadow boundaries; f u r t h e r m o r e   he ingeniously m o d i f i e d the search mechanism to avoid the c o m b i n a t o r i a l e x p l o s i o n of a s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d b r e a d t h - f i r s t procedure. n e v e r t h e l e s s   most of the remarks made here about the huffman-clowes procedure seen in terras of poly apply e q u a l l y to waltz's e x t e n s i o n . waltz also assigns to each surface an i l l u m i n a t i o n statur.: i l l u m i n a t e d   turned away from the l i g h t or shaded by another s u r f a c e . such hypotheses would be 
b e t t e r j u s t i f i e d i f the surface o r i e n t a t i o n s were e x p l i c i t l y represented as in the g r a d i e n t space. s i m i l a r l y hip  treatment of shadows does not include the global consist e n c i e s o u t l i n e d in s e c t i o n i  above. f i n a l l y   
 waltz suggested a scheme to check a l a b e l l e d p i c t u r e by u s i n g quantized versions of l i n e   edge and surface o r i e n t a t i o n s r e l a t e d through t a b u l a t i o n s of possible v a l u e y . poly e x p l o i t s d i r e c t l y a more coneis'..' and t r a n s parent r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of those r e l a t i onships to c o n s t r u c t r i c h scene i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s

　　　f o l k ' s iiitbrpkbt is a well documented account of a complete scene analys i s syster. t h a t i n t e r p r e t s l i n e drawings and so it  is i n s t m o t i v e to see how poly could r e l a t e to 
that program. but f i r s t   ccxmijer f a l k ' s ' faceadjacency g r a p h ' . this concept  although not used in the program  is o u t l i n e d in h i s paper because it 'would be valuable f o r a scene a n a l y s i s system which operated i r  a 
u n i v e r s e of planar faced s o l i d s more complic a t e d '   s   p.1  than the nine simple o b j e c t s h i s program recognizer.. falk suggests doing a huffman-clowes a n a l y s i s of the p i c t u r e to determine which edges are 
connect and then c o n s t r u c t i n g a graph w i t h surfaces as nodes and connect edges as ares . it is then showr. t h a t a property of t h i s graph  ' m e r g c a b i l i t y '   gives the numner of independent p o i n t s t h a t need to be located jn 
three d i mens!ona in orde r to specify the scene c o m p l e t e l y . in p a r t i c u l a r   if the graph is 1 - mergeable   ' ' - connected in g r a p h - t h e o r e t i c terms  then i  p o i n t s must be l o c a t e d . these 1 s c a l a r s correspond to s e t t i n g the o r i g i n and scale of the gradient space and the distance of the object from the p i c t u r e plane. f a l k ' s r e s u l t ap  l i e s d i r e c t l y to the g r a d i e n t space c o n f i g u r a t i o n produced 
by poly  which is not c o n f i n e d to i s o l a t e d   degree - 1 p o l y h e d r a . 
       with respect to interpret i t s e l f   falk mentions s e v e r a l times t h a t a huffman-clowes l a b e l l i n g would have helped the program. those remarks apply  a f o r t i o r i   to poly. in a d d i t i o n   the surface o r i e n t a t i o n s a v a i l a b l e in poly would help in support d e t e r m i n a t i o n and in r e c o g n i t i o n ; a l s o   the i n c l i n a t i o n of edges r e l a t i v e to the p i c t u r e plane give the f o r e s h o r t e n i n g f a c t o r necessary t o c a l c u l a t e 
       true edge l e n g t h . f i n a l l y   consider the seven somewhat opaque h e u r i s t i c s t h a t falk uses to determine possible base edges. he is f o r c e d to use these because at that stage the program is f u n c t i o n i n g e n t i r e l y in the p i c t u r e domain. the a n a l y s i s o f f e r e d by poly  which c o n s t r u c t s a seme 	i n t e r p r e t a t i o n w i t h o u t 	' r e c o g n i s i n g 1 	the 	o b j e c t s   	provides a s t r u c t u r e in which one could f i n d the lowest hidden surface and simply ask which v i s i b l e 	edges are 	attached t o i t . 
       the caveat should be entered t h a t   as they stand  both obscure and poly r e q u i r e complete l i n e drawings while falk i n t e r p r e t s p i c t u r e s in which l i n e s can be m i s s i n g . however  examination of the manner of f a i l u r e of poly on a p a r t i c u l a r p i c t u r e w i l l suggest where l i n e s may be missing or extraneous by showing  at the very l e a s t   which subplcturos can be sensibly i n t e r p r e t e d . furthermore  hypotheses concerning l i n e s to be added or removed can be confirmed by successful a n a l y s i s by poly. 
conclusion 
       although poly 	is 	r e s t r i c t e d to the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of complete 	l i n e 	drawings showing an orthographi c view of a shadow-free pelyhedral 	scene  	the 	extensions 	in section 1 and the 	discussion 	in sect ion 1 suggest t h a t a l l of these 	r e s t r i c t i o n s except the 	overr i d i n g commitment to polyhedra can he overcome. 	be that as it may  	the program does demonstrats 	j u s t bow much s t r u c t u r a l i n f o r m a t i o n can be 	i n f e r r e d from the p i c t u r e using knowledge 	of 	the 	p i c t u r e - t a k i n g process and 	the general 	nature of polyhedra but w i t h out using 	s p e c i f i c 	polyhedral 	p r o t o t y p e s .
