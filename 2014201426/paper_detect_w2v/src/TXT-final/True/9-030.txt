1 . 	i n t r o d u c t i o n 
       in this paper i describe a working system for understanding natural language. the assumptions underl y i n g it are somewhat d i f f e r e n t from those of current a . i . natural language systems  and the c h i e f points of d i f f e r e n c e are these: the present system is not based on a theory of n a t u r a l language derived from contempo-
r a r y l i n g u i s t i c s   nor is it based on theorem proving  tp  techniques and the e s s e n t i a l use of deductive processes. there are e x c e l l e n t reasons for doing auto-
matic theorem p r o v i n g   but not for doing it and c a l l i n g the product natural language a n a l y s i s . 
       it seems a p r i o r i implausible that the operations of the understanding are e s s e n t i a l l y deductive; the 
average man finds the exercises at the end of the f i r s t chapter of a l o g i c book quite hard; yet he understands adequately most of what he reads and hears. there i s   i believe  an unexamined assumption of contemporary a . i . here that s t r i k e s at the root of the 
whole e m p i r i c i s t t r a d i t i o n in science  namely that the p r i n c i p l e s of logic play an e s s e n t i a l r o l e in our 
d e s c r i p t i o n of the w o r l d . it is p e r f e c t l y possible to deny empiricism at that p o i n t and s t i l l be s c i e n t i f i c   but doing so should give cause for more thought and d i s c u s s i o n . the two a t t i t u d e s to t h i s q u e s t i o n   of the r e l a t i o n of deduction and ordinary reasoning  were 
distinguished by hume as f o l l o w s : 
 and if  ideas about f a c t s   are a p t   without extreme care  to f a l l i n t o obscruity and confusion  the inference are always much shorter in these d i s q u i s i t i o n s   and the i n t e r mediate steps much fewer than in the  deductive  sciences . 
　　　understanding systems intended to mimic commonsense reasoning should perhaps aim for these   s h o r t e r     non-deductive  i n f e r e n c e s   even if tp techniques were 
much more advanced than they now a r e . so then  for language understanding by machine we should s t a r t from an appropriate p l a c e   rather than from what we happened to be doing already. a l s o   one should work w i t h a system of analysis capable of handling language in the form in which it a c t u a l l y comes  not in elementary f a c t - f o r m sentences of about eight words  very handy f o r d i r e c t t r a n s l a t i o n in planner or the predicate c a l c u l u s   but in 1 word sentences  f u l l of ambiguous words  complex c o n s t r u c t i o n s   and metaphorical uses. this lacuna is p a r t i c u l a r l y clear in charniak's 1 n a t u r a l understanding system  which a c t u a l l y s t a r t s w i t h c h i l d r e n ' s s t o r i e s as formalized codings. 
       one argument for s t a r t i n g w i t h an a r t i f i c i a l l y s i m p l i f i e d format is that a language containing o n l y   say  simple object words is j u s t part of our language and c o u l d   in p r i n c i p l e   be expanded to the whole. but wittgenstein c a r e f u l l y constructed an experimental language of words l i k e  block  and demonstrated  to the 
s a t i s f a c t i o n of many  	that even though it was a language  
it was one   q u i t e d i f f e r e n t from our own . 
       nor do the systems constructed by contemporary l i n g u i s t s provide any r e a l s t a r t i n g point for t h i s task. their syntax-oriented approaches have f a i l e d to provide adequate computational basis for the analysis of q u i t e ordinary sentences; and the semantic analyses that come 
w i t h them  such as the binary marker system of foder and katz1 are quite inadequate for any attempt to make meaning the central issue. it is not p o s s i b l e   for example  to express the meaning of complex actions l i k e  provoke     i r r i t a t e   or  amuse  by means of any binary system of markers. 
　　　the sytem i describe is intended to be d i f f e r e n t . it is a natural language analyzer and generator centered on notions of meaning and context. it accepts input in english and outputs it in french. this process is indeed machine t r a n s l a t i o n   m l     and  as minsky1 pointed out  any successful a t t a c k on the problem w i l l indeed 
require understanding. the advantage of kt as a cont e x t in which to set an understander is i t s b u i l t - i n empiricism; the answer is c l e a r l y r i g h t or wrong. there is a danger of c i r c u l a r i t y w i t h task-defined notions 
of  understanding  of course: the system might be said to understand if and only if it translates adequately. 
       yet the notion need not be c i r c u l a r here  	for one can suggest desiderata for a meaning centered system. to understand  for mt  a system must understand the conceptual meaning of complex but everyday notions l i k e 
 fascism  or  knowing : it must understand conceptually what is involved in such complex actions as   f o r g i v e   or   i n t e r r o g a t e   . it must resolve the anaphora of pronouns without recourse to long and implausible deductions. it must also be able to understand the 
d i f f e r e n c e of meaning  say  between  word  and   s t o r y   so that when it comes to t r a n s l a t e  i t o l d an x  it 
w i l l use a d i f f e r e n t verb according to whether x is a word or a story and t h i s must be done in a general way  not j u s t by l i s t s . it must also resolve word sense ambiguity from context  not only of agents and a c t i o n s   but  and above a l l  have some theory adequate to disambiguate p r e p o s i t i o n s . anyone who doesn't r e a l i z e how ambiguous they are should consider that  out o f   has at least s i x t r a n s l a t i o n s i n t o french  depending on i t s conceptual r o l e . 
       nothing here  of course  is denying the need for knowledge of the physical w o r l d   and inferences based upon i t   for understanding and t r a n s l a t i o n . what is being argued for here is non-deductive  common sense  inference expressed in formalism that is a n a t u r a l 
extension of the meaning representation i t s e l f . 
　　　a simple case w i l l e s t a b l i s h the need for such i n f e r e n c e : consider the sentence  the s o l d i e r s f i r e d 
1 at the women  and i saw several of them f a l l   . anyone who w r i t e s that sentence w i l l be taken to mean that the women f e l l   so that when  in analyzing the sentence  the question arises of whether  them  r e f e r s to   s o l d i e r s   
or  women   a choice which w i l l r e s u l t in a d i f f e r e n t l y gendered pronoun in french  we w i l l have to be able to i n f e r that things f i r e d at often f a l l   or at least are much more l i k e l y to f a l l than things' doing the f i r i n g . hence there must be access to i n f e r e n t i a l information here  above and beyond the meanings of the constituent words  from which we could i n f e r that hurt things tend to f a l l down. 
　　　the deductive approaches mentioned claim to tackle just such examples  of course  but l a t e r in t h i s paper i w i l l argue for a d i f f e r e n t approach to them which 1 s h a l l c a l l common sense  cs  inferences r u l e s . i s h a l l 
also d i s t i n g u i s h c l e a r l y between cs inference and what i have c a l l e d the deductive approach. 
　　　cs inference rules are put in  from the bottom : that is to flay they would be typed in at the console in e n g l i s h   in the same form as the one above that hurt things f a l l . they would be treated as for t r a n s l a t i o n i n t o french  except that they would remain 
w i t h i n the system in the i n t e r l i n g u a l format  but marked as cs inference r u l e s . they could also be put out in french of course; but the importance here is that the cs rules remain in the same form of representation as the material to be translated subsequently. 
1. 	a system of semantics based language analysis 
　　　a fragmented t e x t is to be represented by an i n t e r l i n g u a l s t r u c t u r e c o n s i s t i n g of templates bound together by paraplates and cs inferences. these three items consist of formulas  and predicates and functions ranging over them and sub-formulas   which in turn consist of elements. 
　　　elements are s i x t y p r i m i t i v e semantic units used to express the semantic e n t i t i e s   s t a t e s   q u a l i t i e s 
and actions about which humans speak and w r i t e . the elements f a l l i n t o five classes  which can be i l l u s t r a t e d   by example  as f o l l o w s .  elements in upper 
case .  a  e n t i t i e s : man  human being   stuff  substances   thing  physical o b j e c t     part  parts of t h i n g s     folk  human groups   act   a c t s     state  states of e x i s t e n c e     beast  animals   e t c .    b  a c t i o n s ; force  compels   cause  causes to happen   flow  moving as l i q u i d s d o     pick  choosing   be  exists  e t c .    c  type i n d i c a t o r s : kind  being a q u a l i t y     how  being a type of action  e t c .    d  s o r t s : cont  being a c o n t a i n e r     good  being morally acceptable   thru 
 being an a p e r t u r e     e t c .   	 e  	cases: 	to   d i r e c t i o n     
sour  source   goal  goal or end   loca   l o c a t i o n     subj 	 actor or agent   obje   p a t i e n t of a c t i o n     in  containment   poss 	 possessed b y     e t c . 
　　　formulas are constructed from elements and r i g h t and l e f t brackets. they express the senses of english 
words; one formula to each sense. the formulas are b i n a r i l y bracketed l i s t s of whatever depth is necessary to express the word sense. they are w r i t t e n and i n t e r -
preted w i t h   in each p a i r at whatever l e v e l it comes  a dependence of l e f t side on corresponding r i g h t . formulas can be thought of  and w r i t t e n out  as binary trees of semantic p r i m i t i v e s . in that form they are not unlike the l e x i c a l decomposition trees of lakoff1  together w i t h a dependency r u l e for i n t e r p r e t i n g the t r e e s . the present system of semantic coding is a 
refinement of one developed in cambridge  england  in the e a r l y s i x t i e s . 
　　　consider che a c t i o n   d r i n k   and i t s r e l a t i o n to the formula: 
  *ani 	subj    flow 	stuff obje   *ani 	in    this 
 *ani 	 thru 	part   to  be cause      
     *ani here is simply the name of a class of elements  those expressing animate e n t i t i e s namely  	man  beast 
and folk  human groups . in order to keep a small usable l i s t of semantic elements  and to avoid a r b i t r a r y extensions of the l i s t   many notions are coded by conventional sub-formulas; so  for example   flow stuff  is used to indicate l i q u i d s   and  thru part  is used to indicate apertures. 
     let us now decompose the formula for   d r i n k   . it is to be read as an a c t i o n   preferably done by animate things  *ani subj  to l i q u i d s   flow stuff obje   of 
causing the l i q u i d to be in the animate thing  *ani in  and via  to i n d i c a t i n g the d i r e c t i o n case  a p a r t i c u l a r aperture of the animate t h i n g ; the mouth of course. it is hard to indicate a notion as s p e c i f i c as  mouth  w i t h such general concepts. but is would be simply i r r e sponsible  i t h i n k   to suggest adding mouth as a semantic p r i m i t i v e   as do semantic systems that simply add an awkward lexeme as a new   p r i m i t i v e   . l a s t l y   the this indicates that the part is a s p e c i f i c part of the subject. 
     the notion of preference is important here: subj case displays the preferred agents of actions  and obje case the preferred objects  or p a t i e n t s . we cannot enter such preferences as s t i p u l a t i o n s   as many l i n g u i s t i c systems do  such as fodor and k a t z ' s 1   s e l e c t i o n r e s t r i c t i o n s     where  if a r e s t r i c t i o n is not s a t i s f i e d   then a sentence simply has  no r e a d i n g   . for we can be said to drink g a l l and wormwood  and cars are said to d r i n k gasoline. it is proper to prefer the normal  quite d i f f e r e n t from p r o b a b i l i s t i c a l l y expecting i t   i shall argue  but it would be absurd  in an i n t e l l i g e n t understanding system  not to accept the normal if it is described. not only everyday metaphor  but the d e s c r i p t i o n of the simplest f i c t i o n s   require i t . 
     a formula expresses the meaning of the word senses to which it is attached. this claim assumes a common sense d i s t i n c t i o n between explaining the meaning of a 
word and knowing facts about the thing the word i n d i c a t e s . the formulas are intended only to express the former  and to express what we might find in a reasonable d i c t i o n a r y though in a formal manner. this common-sense d i s t i n c t i o n cannot be pushed too f a r   but it w i l l serve provided we have  as we do have  other ways of accessing facts about the world than through formulas. 
     so  for example  to know the meaning of  water  we need to know it is a l i q u i d substance  among other 
t h i n g s . but we do not need to know the fact of physics that it freezes i n t o i c e . many of the w o r l d ' s inhabitants have never seen ice and do not know of i t s 
existence even  but they cannot therefore be said to be ignorant of the meaning of whatever the word for 
water is in t h e i r language. 	and anyone who  at t h i s p o i n t   wants to say that those people simply do not know part of the meaning of water should ask himself 
if he r e a l l y wants to say that showing them ice is teach ＊ing them about meanings. m follow from a denial of the common sense d i s t i n c t i o n a bove. 
     this f l e x i b l e method of formula encoding and decomposition  down to any degree of depth necessary to express the meaning of a word  is designed in part to avoid a number of p i t f a l l s   w e l l known in other systems of meaning a n a l y s i s   such as t r y i n g to specify in advance a l l the ways in which an action or agent can be q u a l i f i e d . in a number of a . i . approaches there is often no attempt at l e x i c a l decomposition or the establishment of semantic p r i m i t i v e s . new words 
 encountered  are simply added as primtives in new 


the template matching algorithm w i l l see the it is a hypothesis of this work that we can build sentence under examination as a frame of formulas  up a finite but useful inventory of bare templates one for each of its words  and w i l l look only at the adequate for the analysis of ordinary language: 	a l i s t heads of the formulas. 	given that man force man is in of the messages that people want to convey at some the inventory of bare templates  then one scan of a fairly high level of generality  for template matching frame of formulas  containing formula  ka  for  crook   is not in any sense phrase-matching at the surface level   w i l l have picked up the sequence of formulas labelled 
the bare templates are an attempt to explicate a notion above 1  1  1a  in that order. 	again when a frame of a non-atomistic linguistic pattern  to be located containing formula  kb   the shepherds' sense of whole in texts in the way that human beings seem to when  crook   is scanned  since man force thing is also a they read or listen. proper bare template  the sequence of formulas 1  1  kb w i l l also be selected as a possible i n i t i a l struct-　　　the present working l i s t of bare templates is stored in the program in backus normal form for conven-ure for the sentence  ience of reading. 	the l i s t consists of items like 　　we now have two possible template representations for the sentence after the i n i t i a l match; both a triple 	of formulas in actor-action-object form. 	next  the 
	templates are expanded  if possible. 	this 	process 
which says that  for bare templates whose middle  action  consists of extending the simple networks we have so element is feel  the f i r s t   agent  element must be from far: 	both by attaching other formulas into the net-the class of elements 	*ani. 	similarly  the object work  and strengthening the bonds between those element must come from the element class 	*mar  and already in the template  if possible. 	qualifier therefore be one of the mark elements state  sign or act. formulas can be attached where appropriate and so the a l l of which is to say that only animate things can formula numbered 1  for  big   is tied to that for feel  and that what they feel  since the notion of  policeman  in both templates. 	but now comes a crucial tactile feeling is covered by sense  not feel  are difference between the two representations  one which internal states  and acts  or their written equivalents. i would not wish to defend the particular template l i s t w i l l resolve the sense of  crook . in use at any given moment. 	such lists are always the expansion algorithm looks into the formulas subject to modification by experience  as are the expressing preferences and sees if any of the prefer-formulas and even the inventory of basic elements. 	the ences are satisfied: 	as we saw formula 1 for  big  only possible defense is that the system using them prefers to qualify physical objects. 	a policeman is actually works  which can only be verified by a v i s i t such an object and that additional dependency is marked in the case of a computer program   and if anyone replies in both templates: 	similarly for the preference of 1 

 interrogate  for human actors  in both representations. the difference comes with preferred objects: 	only the formula 1a for human crooks can satisfy that preference  the formula 1b for shepherds' crooks  cannot. 	hence 
the former template network is denser by one dependency  and is preferred over the latter in a l l subsequent processing: its connectivity is  using numbers for the corresponding formulas  and ignoring the  the s : 

and so that becomes the template for this sentence. the other possible template  one arrow for each dependency established  was connected as follows: 

and it is now discarded. 
　　　thus the parts of the formulas that express preferences of various sorts not only express the meaning of the corresponding word sense  but can also be interpreted as implicit procedures for the construction of correct templates. this preference for the greatest semantic density works well  and can be seen as an expression of what joos calls  semantic axiom aumber one 1  that the right meaning is the least 
meaning  or what scriven' has called  the trick  in meaning analysis  of creating redundancies in the input . this uniform principle works over both the areas that are conventionally distinguished in linguistics as syntax and semantics. 	there is no such distinction in this system  since a l l manipulations are of 	formulas 
and templates  and these are a l l constructed out of elements of a single type. 
     the limitation of the illustrative examples  so far  has been that they are the usual short example 
sentences of linguists  whereas what we actually have 
here is a general system for application to paragraph length texts. i w i l l now sketch in  for two sorts of case  how the system deals with non-sentential fragments with a general agent-action-object template format. 
　　　in the actual implementation of the system  an input text  of up to small paragraph length  is i n i t i a l l y fragmented  and templaesare matched with 
each fragment of the text. the input routine partitions paragraphs at the occurrence of any of an extensive l i s t of key words. the l i s t contains almost a l l 
punctuation marks  subjunctions  conjunctions and prepositions. in d i f f i c u l t cases  described in detail in  fragmentations are made even though a key word 
is not present  as at the stroke in  john knows/mary loves him   while in other cases a fragmentation is not 
made in the presence of a key word  such as  that  in  john loves that woman . 	a l l that i am calling fragmentation here would be called primitive syntax by 
many linguists. there is no conflict of views there  for the distinctions that conventional syntax marks 
must be made within any system. what is hypothesized here is that such discriminations require no special emphasis within a system whose only form of coding is what would normally be called semantic. that is to say the fragmentation routine fragm has access only to the semantic formulas for the words of a text. 
　　　let us consider the sentence  john is/in the house   fragmented into two parts at the point marked by the stroke. it should be clear that the three part template  of standard agent-act-action form  cannot be matched onto the fragment  john i s   . in such case  a degenerate template man be dthis is matched onto the two items of this sentence; the last item dthis being a dummy object  indicated by the d. 
     with the second fragment  in the house  a dummy subject dthis f i l l s out the form to give a degenerate template dthis pbe point. 	the pbe is the same as the 
head of the formula for   i n     since formulas for prepositions are assimilated to those for actions and 
have the head pdo or pbe. the fact that they originate in a preposition is indicated by the p  so distinguishing them from the straightforward action formulas with heads do and be. point is the head of the formula for  house   so this bare template triple for the fragment only tells us that  something is at a point in space . at a later stage  after the preliminary assignment of template structures to individual fragments  tie routines attach the structures for separated fragments back together. in that process the dummies are tied back to their antecedents. so  in  john is in the 
house   the dthis in the man be dthis template for the first fragment of the sentence  ties to the whole 
template for the second fragment  expressing where john is. 
　　　it is very important to note that a preference is always between alternatives: if the only structure derivable does not satisfy a declared preference  then it is accepted anyway. only in that way can we deal 
naturally with metaphor. 
     so  in examples like  i heard an earthquake/singing/ in the shower   with fragmentation as indicated by slashes   as contrasted with  i heard/an earthquake sing/in the shower   we shall expect  in the first case  to derive the correct representation because of the 
preference of notions like singing for animate agents. this is done by a simple extension of the density techniques discussed to relations between structures for 
different fragments  the tie routines   in this case  by considering alternative connectivities for dummy parts of templates. 
　　　thus  for the fragment/singing/ there w i l l be a template with a dummy subject and a dummy object. 	the template w i l l be based on the triple of heads dthis cause dthis  and w i l l contain only one real formula  namely: 
 singing :  *ani subj   sign obje    man subj sense  cause      
which is to say  an act by an animate agent of causing a human to experience some sign  i.e. the song . 
　　　now the overall density w i l l be greater when the agent dthis  in the template for  singing   is tied to a formula for  i  in a preceding template  than when it is tied to one for  earthquake   since only the former satisfies the preference for an animate agent  and so the correct interpretation of the whole utterance is 
made. 
　　　but  and here we come to the point of this example  in the second sentence  with  sing   no such exercise of preference is possible  and the system must accept an interpretation in which the earthquake sings  since only that can be meant. 
　　　so far  i have emphasized the procedures of analysis within the individual fragment. 	after what i have described  the tie routines are applied to the expanded templates in a wider context: 	the same techniques of 
expansion  dependency and preference are applied between f u l l templates for different fragments of a 
sentence or paragraph. at that stage   1  case ties are applied  using the same cases as occur within formulas at a lower level ;  1  the equivalence of 
actives and passive forms is noted;  1  dummies are attached to  what they stand for  as i indicated with 

*dire is a direction case marker  covering two subcases: to  mentioned above  and from   1bcas and 1bhead are simply predicates that look at both the object  third  formulas of the template in hand  and of the preceding templates  i.e. at two objects. 1bhead is true i f f the two have the same head  and 1bcas is true i f f they contain the same goal or instrument subformula. the lower case words simply explain which sense of   i n   is the one appropriate to the paraplate in which it occurs. when the system is functioning as a translator these generation items w i l l in this case be different french prepositions. 
　　　now consider the sentence  i put the key/in the lock   fragmented at the stroke as shown. let us consider that two templates have been set up for the second fragment: one for  lock  as a fastener  and one for the raising lock on a canal. both formulas 
may be expected to refer to the containment case. we apply the f i r s t paraplate and find that it f i t s only for the template with the correct  fastener  sense of  lock   since only there w i l l 1bcas be satisfied  i.e. where the formulas for  lock  and  key  both have a 
subformula under goal indicating that their purpose is to close something. the second paraplate w i l l f i t with the template for the canal sense of  lock   but the f i r s t is a more extensive f i t  indicated by the order of the paraplates  since the higher up the paraplate l i s t   the more non-trivial template functions a 
paraplate contains  and is preferred. this preference has simultaneously selected both the right template for the second fragment and the correct paraplate 
linking the two templates for further generation tasks. 
　　　if we now take the sentence  he put the number/ in the table   with two different templates for the second fragment  corresponding to the l i s t and flat object senses of  table  respectively  we shall find that the intuitively correct template  the l i s t sense  fails both the f i r s t paraplate and the second  but f i t s the third  thus giving us the 'make part of  sense 
of   i n     and the right  list  sense of  table   since 
formulas for  number  and   l i s t    table  have the same 
head sign  though the formula for   f l a t   wooden   table  does not. 
     conversely  in the case of  he put the l i s t / i n the table   f i t t i n g the correct template with the second 
paraplate w i l l yield  into  sense of   i n    case direction  and the physical object sense of  table ; and this w i l l be the preferred reading  since the f i t  of the incorrect template  with the third paraplate yields the  make part of a l i s t   reading in this case. 
here we see the f i t t i n g of paraplates  and choosing the densest preferential f i t   which is always selecting the highest paraplate on the l i s t that f i t s   thus 
determining both word sense ambiguity and the case ambiguity of prepositions at once. paraplate f i t t i n g makes use of deeper nested parts  essentially the case relations other than subj and obje  of the formulas than does the template matching. 
     the tie routines also deal with simple cases of anaphora on a preference basis. in cases such as  i bought the wine /sate on a rock/ and drank i t     it is easy to see that the last word should be tied by tie to  wine  and not  rock . this matter is settled by density after considering alternative ties for   i t     and seeing which yields the denser representation overall. it w i l l be  wine  in this case since  drink  prefers a liquid object. 
     in more complex cases of anaphora  chat require access to more information than is contained in formulae  templates or paraplates  the system brings 
down what i referred to earlier as cs inference rules. cases that require them w i l l be ones like the sentence:  the soldiers fired at the women and i saw several of them f a l l   . simple semantic density considerations in tie are inadequate here because both soldiers and women can f a l l equally easily  yet making the choice correctly is vital for a task like translation because the two alternatives lead to differently gendered 
pronouns in french  	in such cases the ps system applies a cs rule  whose form  using variables and sub-formulas  
would be x   notplease  life state  obje sense  x notup move . for rough expository purposes such a rule is probably better expressed as x hurt -x fall   where the words in square parentheses correspond informally to the subformulas in the rule. the rules are applied to  extractions  from the situations to form chains  and a rule only ultimately applies if it 
can function in the shortest  most-preferred  chain. 
　　the way the cs inferences work is roughly as follows: they are called in at present only when tie 
is unable to resolve outstanding anaphoras  as in the present example. 	a process of extraction is then done and it is to these extractions  and the relevant templates  that the cs rules subsequently apply. 	the extractions are quasi-inferences from the deep case structure of formulas. 	so for example  if we were 
extracting from the template for  john drank the water   unp eking the formula for  water  given earlier would extract that some liquid was inside an animate thing  from the containment case   and that it went in through an aperture of the animate thing  from the directional case . moreover  since the extractions are partially confirmed  as it were  by the information about actor and object in the surrounding template  we can  by simple tying of variables  extract new quasi-templates equivalent to  in ordinary language   the water is in john  etc. these are  when in coded form  the extractions to which the cs rules apply as 
it endeavors to build up a chain of extractions and inferences. the preferred chain w i l l   unsurprisingly  be the shortest. this part of the system is described more fully in   1 . 
1      so then  in the  women and soldiers  example we extract a coded form by variable tying in the templates equivalent to  women   hurt   since we can t e l l from the formula for  fired at  that it is intended to hurt the object of the action. we are seeking for partial confirmation of the assertion x    f a l l     and such a chain is completed by the rule given  though not by a rule equivalent to  say  x hurt ~x die    since there is nothing in the sentence as given to partially confirm that rule in a chain  and cause it 
to f i t here. since we are in fact dealing w i t h subformulas in the statraent of the r u l e s   r a t h e r than 
words  	  f i t t i n g   means an  adequate match of subformulas . 
       it is conceivable that there would be a n   implausible  chain of rules and extractions g i v i n g the 
other r e s u l t   namely that the soldiers f a l l :   s o l d i e r s     f i r e   : x   f i r e   - x   f i r e d a t   - x   h u r t   e t c . but such a chain would be longer than the one already constructed and would not be p r e f e r r e d . 
　　　the most important aspect of t h i s procedure is that it gives a r a t i o n a l e for selecting a preferred i n t e r p r e t a t i o n   rather than simply r e j e c t i n g one in favor of another  as other systems do  see discussion 
below . 	it can never be r i g h t to reject another 
i n t e r p r e t a t i o n irrevocably in cases of t h i s s o r t   since it may turn out later to be c o r r e c t   as if the  women  sentence above had been followed by  and a f t e r ten 
minutes hardly a s o l d i e r was l e f t standing . a f t e r i n p u t t i n g that sentence  the relevant preferences in the example might be expected to change. nonetheless  the present approach is not in any way p r o b a b i l i s t i c . in the case of someone who u t t e r s the  soldiers and women  example sentence  what he is to be taken as 
meaning is that the women f e l l . it is of no importance in that decision if it l a t e r turns out that he intended to say that the s o l d i e r s f e l l . what was meant by that sentence is a c l e a r   and not merely a l i k e l i h o o d matter. 
       it must be emphasized t h a t   in the course of t h i s a p p l i c a t i o n   the cs rules are not being interpreted 
at any point as rules of inference making t r u t h claims about the physical w o r l d . it is for that reason that i am not c o n t r a d i c t i n g myself in t h i s paper by describing cs approach while arguing against deductive and tp 
approaches. the clearest way to mark the difference is to see that there is no inconsistency involved in r e t a i n i n g the r u l e expressed informally as   x   f a l l j x   h u r t     w h i l e   at the same time  r e t a i n i n g a d e s c r i p t i o n of some s i t u a t i o n in which something animate f e l l but was not hurt in the l e a s t . there is a clear d i f f e r e n c e here from any kind of deductive system which  by d e f i n i t i o n   could not r e t a i n such an incon-
s i s t e n t p a i r of a s s e r t i o n s . 
1. 	implementation of the system 
　　　the system is programmed in lisp 1 and mlisp1 and runs o n - l i n e at the stanford a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e p r o j e c t . it is at present  running over a small vocabulary of about 1 words  but expanding r a p i d l y and already accepting information of up to small paragraph l e n g t h . i t s s t r u c t u r a l c a p a b i l i t i e s are already w e l l developed  and by the end of next year or so  we hope to have it t r a n s l a t i n g paragraphs from the ap news wires 
a v a i l a b l e every day w i t h i n the system. 
　　　the sections of the analysis program up to and i n c l u d i n g expand were programmed in lisp 1 by the author; those beyond and the generate program were programmed by annette herskovits in mlisp1  as was the sail program which holds the other programs together. 
　　　the emphasis in t h i s paper has been on the concepts in use rather than implementation d e t a i l s   but the 
generation program is of an independent i n t e r e s t and is described elsewhere1. there is no morphology in the system; every word being a separate lisp atom. this seems j u s t i f i a b l e at the present stage  since morphology programs are of no r e a l research i n t e r e s t   but w i l l have to be added as the system grows. the fragm r o u t i n e can c a l l on the r e s u l t s of l a t e r and deeper analysis in order to make fragmentations in d i f f i c u l t cases  by considering what matches and subsequent expansions would be possible if certain fragmentations were made and  as usual  preferring the one that would lead to the  semantically densest  overall result. none of this can really be called using the semantics while doing the syntax  since that distinction does not really exist in the system. everything is done by uniform semantic means. 
     the general structure of the system is indicated by the following diagram: 

     one shot frames of formulas for fragments are passed to match which sifts them and passes on only the best to expand  where there is no backtracking and the most expanded template is chosen from those avail-
able. tie f i t s these templates for a text back into a structured representation for the whole by means of the paraplates and common sense inference rules to settle case and anaphora questions. the cs inference rules are brought down and effectively added to the text. 
     it is not claimed that the present methods w i l l be adequate for tasks like question answering  and the upper box in the diagram envisages an ultimate interface to a deductive system for matters appropriate to i t . 
1 . 	discussion 
     i have argued in this paper for a preference semantics  ps  approach to constructing the core of a language understanding system  and by implication against the thesis that a tp system is necessary for the understanding required for mi. i would also suggest that if it is not necessary then a tp system is not particularly desirable either  unless theorem proving is indubitably what one wants to do. a ps system is more consonant with common sense intuitions  and also avoids the well-known d i f f i c u l t i e s of searching among the large body of axioms required  unreallstically large for any serious language computation  especially if the axioms contain actual 
word names as they occur in elementary facts  as they do in the standard approaches   d i f f i c u l t i e s of proof strategy and so on. 
     i certainly am not claiming that the inference procedures described in this paper have proved their worth yet. 	only that they w i l l be tested with respect to a real and general linguistic base  which seems to me important. 
　　　let me make a final point of comparison with respect to an example of winograd's1. he gives two sentences as follows  though he does not claim to deal 
with the d i f f i c u l t y they present: 
i  	i put the heavy book on the table and it broke. 
i i   i put the butterfly wing on the table and it broke. 
　　　there is no problem here  concerning the referent of   i t   in each sentence  for a ps analysis if we envisage  broke  as preferring  apparent  agents that are marked fragile or rigid in their formulas in that order of preference. 
       in   i   the table w i l l be selected because it is r i g i d though the book is not  while in   i i   the insectpart w i l l be selected because it is fragile while the table is only rigid. 
       note here that it is easy to specify preferences  though i would not know how to begin to specify the appropriate axioms and boundary conditions for a tp approach to the example. there would be too many axioms to search among  in no obviously principled manner  to 
settle the example. 
　　　note too that the information required for ps here is a l l available in the appropriate place  in the templates already constructed. 	and the strategy employed is uniform   i . e . preference for  syntax   semantics  
and inference  not ad hoc for each case in the way that planner specifically encourages. of course  planner  could be used to program the present approach as well as any other  what i am talking about here is the content  the principles programmed  which were entirely different at each stage of winograd's program  halliday grammar  fodor and katz semantics  f i r s t order logic . 
       it w i l l probably be replied at this point  and r i g h t l y so  well that's a l l very w e l l   but what about 
the d i f f i c u l t cases where you go wrong  i am sure that 
a l l systems w i l l go wrong sometimes  yet i see no reason to think that tp systems w i l l have any better chance of finding they have erred than a ps system has  and for four reasons: 
1  there is no general test of consistency available in any system  and certainly none in the planner type systems. so  even though they have an explicit logic  in which contradiction is of course defined  how could they know they were wrong in any given case  unless the text examined was kind enough to contradict the wrong deduction e x p l i c i t l y and pretty soon after it had been made  
1  many of the most popular examples in t h i s 	f i e l d have an i r r e s o l a b l e vagueness  where one 
can hardly be said to be   w o n g   at a l l whatever one decides is the antecedent of a p a r t i c u l a r pronoun. i think charniak's case is probably one: 'vhen penny 
heard about the costume b a l l she started t h i n k i n g about 
what mother could wear  mother had to t e l l her she had not been i n v i t e d .   . there is simply not enough informa t i o n to make a   r i g h t   choice about the reference of the   s h e   . some readers may i n s i s t at t h i s point that tne case is not s i g n i f i c a n t l y d i f f e r e n t from my  women and s o l d i e r s   example where i argued t h a t the i n t u i t i v e l y correct answer could not be d i s p u t e d . even granted t h a t   my general case is not weakened  for i argued in the e a r l i e r case too that the i n t u i t i v e -
ly i n c o r r e c t answer should not simply disappear 	from s i g h t   as it were  but be less p r e f e r r e d . 	what seems to me the important missing piece in the approaches 
1 
l i k e charniak's is that one is shown how the 	  c o r r e c t   
answer ie achieved  but never shown why the other answer is not achieved. yet on the sorts of premises usually given for examples  it ought perhaps to be  since it is easy to stress that sentence so that penny becomes the referent of the troublesome pronoun. so even w i t h a deductive analyzer both answers ought perhaps to be  deduced   yet they never a r e . nor are 
we even shown why the desired answer would always be found f i r s t . some analog of preference could perhaps be b u i l t i n t o even the deductive approach in terms of r e l a t i v e lengths of p r o o f s . 
     1  there is an i m p l i c i t but u n j u s t i f i e d assumption in the deductive approach that the u t t e r e r w i l l always use c o r r e c t l o g i c . should he f a i l t o   things go badly wrong. consider the f o l l o w i n g s i l l y c h i l d r e n ' s s t o r y :  i have a nice dog and a slimy snake. my dog has white f u r r y ears. a l l animals have ears but my snake has no 
ears  so it is a mammal too. 	i c a l l it horace.  
     since the story contains a l o g i c a l e r r o r   any deductive analyzer for s o l v i n g anaphora problems in c h i l d r e n ' s s t o r i e s 1  must conclude that it is the dog that is c a l l e d horace  since only that conclusion is consistent w i t h i t s i n f o r m a t i o n     whereas any reader can see that horace is a snake. this is only a knock-
down argument of course  but it could be a m p l i f i e d from current l i n g u i s t i c s   1 and 1   where a great deal of misguided t h e o r e t i c a l e f f o r t has been made to e s t a b l i s h . 
the connection between conventional l o g i c and the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of utterances. 
     1  cases can be constructed that r e a l l y do need deductions on facts to resolve such references  and i t h i n k charniak's   t o p   example is one such. but they 
are puzzles  dear to the heart of all true a . i . people  and therefore perhaps not examples of n a t u r a l language understanding at a l l . no one could possibly deny that there are such puzzles statable in n a t u r a l language  
but ordinary people have d i f f i c u l t y understanding them. they are r a r e l y found in ordinary speech or w r i t i n g that communicates without causing puzzlement. 
     it seems to me the onus is on tp people to produce examples  unamenable to ps methods  yet which are not i r r e s o l u b l y vague  nor are they puzzles. i suspect it w i l l not be that easy  since there is a n c i l l i a r y 
evidence that people understand in j u s t the sort of conceptual density way i have t r i e d to map. 
　　　if i am at a l l r i g h t in this c o n j e c t u r e   then it may be possible that a . i . ' s problem-solving and theoremproving ancestry may have been more a hindrance than a help w i t h the d i f f i c u l t problem of n a t u r a l language understanding  and that a s o l u t i o n may be found by concentrating more on e f f o r t s to represent meaning adequately  and to choose  in a p r i n c i p l e d way  between a l t e r n a t i v e i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s .
