 
gr1 is a hybrid knowledge-based system consisting of a multilayer perceptron  mlp  and a rule-based system for hybrid knowledge representations and reasoning. knowledge embedded in the trained mlp is extracted in the form of general  production  rules - a natural format of abstract knowledge representation. the rule extraction method integrates black-box and open-box techniques  obtaining feature salient and statistical properties of the training pattern set.the extracted general rules are quantified and selected in a rule validation process. multiple inference facilities such as categorical reasoning  
probabilistic reasoning and exceptional reasoning are performed in gr1. 
key words: rule extraction  hybrid knowledgebased system  neural network  rule validation 
1 	motivation 
the knowledge acquisition bottle-neck is a major obstruction to knowledge engineering. the technology of artificial neural networks  anns  provides a helpful approach to get around it. however  the black-box nature of anns makes users reluctant to use them. an optimally organised hybrid system  which includes an ann fulfilling automatic knowledge acquisition and a rule-based system  rbs  supporting it with a symbolic inference engine and user interface  can overcome those problems and provide richer knowledge representations and reasoning facilities than the ann. 
　the central themes of hybrid system methodology include the following two considerations:  i  the optimal format of the symbolic knowledge representation and  ii  the rule extraction method which transfers the subsymbolic knowledge acquired by the ann into the symbolic knowledge format accurately  abstracdy and efficiently.

poses of this application  the final diagnoses were collapsed into two classes termed  ami   q wave ami and non-q wave ami  and  not-ami   all other diagnoses . ami cases were assigned as positive diagnoses  not-ami cases as negative diagnoses. the mlp was constructed with 1:1 as the sizes of the input:hidden:output layers respectively. the 
error tolerance was a=1. because the positive and negative patterns are unevenly distributed in the data set  1 and 1 respectively  random divisions of the training set and test set may result in very different outcomes. the 1 patient records were divided into two data sets  1 randomly selected as the training set  and the remaining 1 as the test set. 
　there are three performance criteria on the data set  being used in the medical community. sensitivity is defined as the 
ratio of the number of correct positive diagnoses to the number of positive outcomes. this is most important as the disease is life-threatening. specificity is defined as the ratio of the number of correct negative diagnoses to the number of negative outcomes. this is important as treatment is expensive and can be risky. accuracy is defined as the ratio of the number of correct diagnoses to the total number.

1 	diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction 
 heart attack  
　the early identification of patients with acute ischaemic heart disease remains a great challenge in emergency medicine. the ecg only shows diagnostic changes in about half of acute myocardial infarction  ami  patients at presentation  adams et al.  1b; stark and vacek  1 . none of the available biochemical tests becomes positive until at least three hours after symptoms begin  making such measurements of limited use for the early triage of patients with suspected ami  adams et al.  1a . the early diagnosis of ami  therefore  relies on an analysis of clinical features along with ecg data. an mlp has been shown to be a good method for combining clinical and electrocardiographic 
data into a decision aid for the early diagnosis of ami  kennedy et al.  1 . the data used in this study were derived from consecutive patients attending the accident and emergency department of the royal infirmary  edinburgh  scotland  with non-traumatic chest pain as the major symptom. the relevant clinical and ecg data were entered onto 
a purpose-designed proforma at  or soon after  the patient's presentation. the study included both patients who were admitted and those who were discharged. 1 patients were re-
cruited during the study period  september to december 1 . the final diagnosis for these patients was assigned independently by a consultant physician  a research nurse 
and a cardiology registrar. this diagnosis made use of follow-up ecgs  cardiac enzyme studies and other investigations as well as clinical history obtained from review of the 
patient's notes. 
　the input data items for the mlp were all derived from data available at the time of the patient's presentation. in all  1 items were used  coded as 1 binary inputs. for the pur-
