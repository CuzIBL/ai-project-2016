 
in the last three years  several  radically new  and promising approaches have been developed for tackling the plan synthesis problem. currently  these approaches exist in isolation as there is no coherent explanation of their sources of strength vis a vis the traditional refinement planners. in this paper  i provide a generalized view of refinement planning  that subsumes both traditional and newer approaches to plan synthesis. i will interpret the contributions of the new approaches in terms of a new subclass of refinement planners called  disjunctive planners . this unifying view raises several intriguing possibilities for complementing the strengths of the various approaches. 1 will identify and pose these as challenges to the planning community. 
1. introduction 
most traditional approaches to plan generation  developed over the last twenty years  work by searching in the space of partial plans  extending a plan incrementally until it becomes a solution  and backtracking when a plan can no longer be fruitfully refined. more recently  several approaches have been developed that relate plan synthesis to constraint satisfaction. these include graphplan  blum & furst  1   satplan  kautz & selman  1   cops 
 ginsberg  1   descartes  joslin & pollack  1  and 
ucpop-d  kambhampati & yang  1 . graphplan and 
satplan approaches  in particular  have demonstrated impressive scale-up potential in practice. 
　at present  there exists a huge gulf between these new breed of algorithms and the traditional refinement planning approaches. an important challenge for the planning community is to bridge these strands of research to see if their strengths can be complemented. to this end  i present a generalization of the refinement planning framework developed in our previous work  kambhampati  knoblock & yang  1; kambhampati & srivastava  1  that covers most of the currently known approaches. 
　according to my general framework  partial plans are shorthand notations for sets of action sequences  called the candidate set of the plan . plan synthesis involves a  split and prune'' search  pearl  1 . the pruning is carried out by applying refinement operations to a given set of partial plans  called a planset . pruning attempt to incrementally get rid of non-solutions from the candidate set. the splitting part involves pushing the component partial plans of a planset into different branches of the search tree. its main aim is

ai challenges 
to reduce the cost of applying refinements and termination check to the planset. termination test involves checking if a solution can be extracted from the  possibly exponential number of  minimal candidates of the current planset. the extraction process can in general be cast as a constraint satisfaction search. 
　within this framework  traditional planners can be seen as doing both pruning  refinement  and full splitting  pushing each component of the planset into a different search branch . they thus refine and terminate on individual partial plans  rather than plansets . the scale-up problems associated with these planners can be related to their full splitting. an obvious way of curing this malady involves avoiding splitting or controlling it intelligently. to implement this idea-which i call  disjunctive planning - we need to find ways of effectively refining and terminating on large sets of plans. all the newer planners can be seen as providing potential solutions to these two problems. graphplan  and cops  can be seen as clarifying the issues involved in compactly representing and reasoning with plansets. satplan demonstrates how the problem of extracting solutions from a planset can be posed as a sat problem  so that it can be solved by the new breed of efficient sat solvers  kautz et. al.  1; crawford & auton  1; bayardo & schrag  1 . finally  descartes and ucpop-d can be seen as exploring the effect of controlled  rather than complete or no  splitting of the plansets. 
　viewing existing planners as points in a spectrum of possible disjunctive planners opens several exciting avenues of focused research: could the missing planners corresponding to the other points in the spectrum be more efficient  what are the tradeoffs governing the efficiency of these spectrum of planners  i will identify specific short-term and intermediate-term challenges that have to be undertaken to answer these questions. 
　the rest of the paper is organized as follows. section 1 presents my generalized framework for refinement planning. section 1 motivates the idea of disjunctive planning  and interprets several newer approaches as providing guidelines for implementing disjunctive planners. section 1 relates satplan family of algorithms to disjunctive planning. 
section 1 lists and motivates a set of challenge problems that arise from this unifying view. section 1 briefly discusses the logistics of coordinating the research into the challenge problems. 
1. refinement planning: overview 
since a solution for a planning problem is ultimately a sequence of actions  plan synthesis in a general sense involves sorting our way through the set of all action sequences until we end up with a sequence that is a solution. this is the essential idea behind refinement planning. the 

sets of action sequences are represented and manipulated in terms of partial plans which can be seen as a collection of constraints the action sequences denoted by a partial plan  i.e.  those that are consistent with its constraints  are called its candidates. for technical reasons that will become clear later  we find it convenient to think in terms of sets of  instead of single  partial plans. a set of partial plans is called a planset with its constituent partial plans referred to as the components. the candidate set of a planset is defined as the union of the candidate sets of its components. 
　a refinement  pruning  operation narrows the candidate set of a planset by adding constraints to its component plans. if no solutions are eliminated in this process  we will eventually progress towards the set of all solutions. termination can occur as soon as we can pick up a solution using some bounded time operation - called the solution extraction function. to make these ideas precise  we shall now look at the syntax and semantics of partial plans and refinement operations. 
1 partial plan representation: syntax 

figure 1. an example  partial  plan in rocket domain. 
　a partial plan can be seen as any set of constraints that together delineate which action sequences belong to the plan's candidate set and which do not. one commonly used representation models partial plans as a set of steps  ordering constraints between the steps  and auxiliary constraints  we shall discuss alternative representations  such as that proposed by ginsberg   later . the ordering constraints may require steps to precede each other or be contiguous. the auxiliary constraints demand the preservation of a condition over a time interval between two steps  called ipcs  or the truth of a condition at a time point  called point truth constraints . an example plan in this representation from the one-way rocket domain  involving transportation of two packages from earth to moon using a single one-way rocket  is shown in figure 1. 
1 partial plan representation: semantics 
the semantics of the partial plans are given in terms of candidate sets. a candidate can be seen as a model of the partial plan constraints. an action sequence belongs to the candidate set of a partial plan if it contains the actions corresponding to all the steps of the partial plan  in an order consistent with the ordering constraints on the plan  and it also satisfies all preservation constraints. for the example plan shown in figure 1  the action sequences shown on the left in figure 1 are candidates  while those on the right are noncandidates. 
　notice that the candidates may contain more actions than are present in the partial plan. because of this  a plan's candidate set can be potentially infinite. we define the notion of minima  candidates  to let us restrict our attention to a 
finite subset of the possibly infinite candidate set. specifically  minimal candidates are candidates that only contain the actions listed in the partial plan  thus their length is equal to the number of steps in the plan other than 1 and   . the top candidate on the left of figure 1 is a minimal candidate while the bottom one is not. there is a one-to-one correspondence between the minimal candidates and-the syntactic notion of safe linearizations of a plan  where a safe linearization is a permutation of plan steps that satisfies the auxiliary preservation constraints. for example  the minimal candidate on the top left of figure 1 corresponds to the safe linearization 1-1-1-a  as can be verified by translating the step names in the latter to corresponding actions . 

figure 1. candidate set of a plan 
1 refinement strategies 
a refinement strategy r maps a planset p to another planset pr such that the candidate set of pr is a subset of the candidate set of p. r is said to be complete if pr contains all the solutions of p. it is said to be progressive if the candidate set of pr is a strict subset of the candidate set of p. r is said to be strongly progressive if the length of the minimal candidates increases after the refinement. the degree of progressiveness is measured in terms of the reduction in the candidate set size. it is said to be systematic if no action sequence falls in the candidate set of more than one component of pr. 
　completeness ensures that we don't lose solutions by the application of refinements. progressiveness ensures that refinement narrows the candidate set  i.e.  has pruning power . strongly progressive refinement strategies simultaneously shrink the candidate set of the plan  and increase the length of its minimal candidates. this provides an incremental way of exploring the  potentially infinite  candidate set of a planset for solutions: examine the minimal candidates  corresponding to safe linearizations  of the 
planset after each refinement to see if any of them conespond to solutions. systematicity ensures that we never consider the same candidate more than once  if we were to explore the components of the planset separately. 
　refinements are best seen as canned inference procedures that compute the consequences of the meta-theory of planning  and the domain theory  in the form of actions   in the specific context of the current partial plan constraints. traditional planners use four types of refinement strategies forward state space  backward state space  plan space and task-reduction  kambhampati  1 . figure 1 shows a forward state space refinement of a partial plan in the one-way rocket domain. it takes the null planset  corresponding to all action sequences and maps it to a planset containing 1 components. in this case  given the theory of planning  which says that solutions must have actions that are executable in their respective states  and the current planset constraint that the state of the world before the first step is the initial state  the forward state space refinement infers that the only actions that can come as the second step in the solution are load a   load b  and fly  . 
　this particular refinement is complete since no solution to the rocket problem can start with any other action for the given initial state. it is progressive since it eliminated the action sequences not beginning with load a   load b  or 
fly   from consideration. finally  it is systematic since no

1 plan synthesis 
we are now in a position to present the general refinement planning template  which we do in figure 1. if the current planset has an extractable solution-which is checked by inspecting its minimal candidates to see if any of them is a solution- we terminate. if not  we select a refinement strategy r and apply it to the current planset to get a new planset. this is the pruning step. the third step is the splitting step  and involves pushing the components of the refined planset into different branches. the splitting is controlled by the parameter k. if k equals 1  no splitting is done. if k equals the number of components of the refined planset  full splitting is done. intermediate values of k correspond to intermediate levels of splitting. after the splitting step  one of the search branches is selected non-deterministically  and pruning and splitting is applied to it recursively. 

figure 1  refinement planning with pruning and splitting 
　as long as the selected refinement strategy r is complete  the algorithm will never lose a solution. as long as the refinements are strongly progressive  for solvable problems  the algorithm will eventually reach a planset one of whose minimal candidates will be a solution. 
　the solution extraction process involves searching through the possibly exponential number of minimal candidates of a planset for a solution. as k increases  individual plansets have fewer components  and consequently the cost of solution extraction reduces. 
　the algorithm template in figure 1 covers both traditional and newer plan synthesis approaches  see  kambhampati  1  for a more elaborate discussion . traditional refinement planners  such as ucpop  prodigy  snlp  etc. correspond to complete splitting  i.e.  k equals the number of components of the planset  differing mainly in the type of refinements they employ. the newer approaches such as graphplan  cops  descartes and ucpop-d can be seen as handling plansets without splitting. the first two do not do any splitting  while the last two do controlled splitting. finally  satplan approaches can be understood as posing the solution extraction as a sat problem. 
ai challenges 
1. disjunctive planning 
we saw that traditional planners do refinement planning with full splitting  differing mainly in terms of the specific refinement strategies they use. unfortunately  these planners tend to generate huge search spaces and have in practice shown disappointing scale-up potential. viewing the newer approaches such as graphplan and satplan as instances of our framework suggests that a promising general solution involves handling plansets without splitting. this idea  referred to as disjunctive planning  raises three immediate issues: how do we  a  represent   b  refine and  c  extract solutions from large plansets  i will discuss the first two issues in this section. the most promising approach for solution extraction at present seems to be to pose it as a csp/sat problem. i will discuss this further in section 1  in the context of satplan. 
1 disjunctive representations 
first off  keeping plansets together may lead to very unwieldy data structures. the way to get around this is to  internalize  the disjunction in the plansets so that we can represent them more compactly. the general idea of dis-
junctive representations is to allow disjunctive step  ordering  and auxiliary constraints into a plan. figure 1 and figure 1 show two examples the idea. the three plans on the left in figure 1 can be combined into a single disjunctive step  with disjunctive contiguity constraints. similarly  the two plans in figure 1 can be combined by using a single disjunctive step constraint  a disjunctive precedence constraint  a disjunctive interval preservation constraint and a disjunctive point truth constraint. 


in practice since it makes the refinement stage exponentially hard. we need to generalize the traditional refinement strategies so that they can apply directly to the disjunctive plans. i will now attempt to outline the critical issues in doing this. 
　since refinement strategies essentially derive the consequences of planning and domain theory in the context of the current plan constraints  it is clear that internal disjunction in the partial plan may lead to the derivation of weaker consequences  thus reducing their pruning power . for example  for the disjunctive plan on the right in figure 1  we don't know which of the three steps will actually occur in the eventual solution. consequently  we don't exactly know what the state of the world will be after the disjunctive step. this means that the forward state space refinement will not be able to infer exactly which actions can appear in the second step of the solution. similarly  for the disjunctive plan in figure 1  we don't know whether steps 1 or 1 or both will be present in the eventual solution. thus a plan space refinement won't know whether it should introduce steps relevant to at a e  precondition  those relevant to at b e  precondition  or both. 
　all is not lost however  as the refinements can still infer a superset of the relevant actions. for example  for the plan in figure 1  although we do not know the exact state after the first  disjunctive  step  we know that it can only be a subset of the union of conditions in the effects of the three steps. knowing that only load a   load b  or fly r  can be the first steps in the plan tells us that the state after the first step can only contain the conditions in a   in b  and at r m . we can thus generalize forward state space refinement to add only those actions whose preconditions are subsumed by the union of propositions comprising the effects of the three steps. similarly  plan-space refinement can be generalized to introduce actions to achieve all parts of a disjunctive precondition. 
　these  naive  generalizations of the standard refinements are still complete  but have far less pruning power than the standard refinements operating on non-disjunctive plansets. in the case of the generalized forward state space refinement  even if the preconditions of an action are in the union of effects of the preceding disjunctive step  there may be no real way for that action to actually be take place. for example  in figure 1  although the preconditions of  unload at moon  action may seem satisfied  it is actually never going occur as the second step in any solution because load   and fly   cannot be done at the same time. in fact  this naive generalization may allow an exponential number of additional actions that will not be considered by traditional forward state space refinement operating on non-disjunctive plans  kambhampati & lambrecht  1 . 
　although the loss of progressiveness in refining a disjunctive plan cannot be completely avoided  it can be reduced to a significant extent by extending the types of consequences inferred by the refinements. traditional refinement strategies concentrate exclusively on inferring the identities of new actions that must be part of any eventual solution. we can widen the focus in the context of disjunctive plans. for example  in figure 1  using the domain and planning theory  we can recognize that actions load a  and fly r  cannot both occur in the first step  since their preconditions and effects are interacting . propagating this information tells us that the second state may either have in a  or at r m   but not both. here the interaction between the steps 1 and 1 propagates to make the conditions in a  and at r m   mutually exclusive  in the next disjunctive state. thus any action which needs both in a  and at r m  can be ignored at the next level. the particular strategy described here is similar to the one employed by blum and furst's  graphplan algorithm  and has been shown to be a major source of its efficiency  kambhampati & lambrecht  1 . similar techniques need to be developed for plan-space refinements. 
　to summarize  disjunctive plans can be refined directly and efficiently  at the expense of some of the progressiveness  pruning power  of the refinement. the loss of pruning power can be countered by widening the scope of the refinements to infer more than just the potential actions in the solution. 
1. relating satplan to disjunctive planning 
the satplan approach involves generating a sat encoding  all models of which will correspond to it-length solutions to the problem  for some fixed integer k . modelfinding is done by efficient sat solvers  selman et. al.  1; crawford & auton  1; bayardo & schrag  1 . kautz et. al. propose to start with some arbitrary value of k and increase it if they do not find solutions of that length. they have considered a variety of ways of generating the encodings  corresponding loosely to different traditional planning algorithms. 
　in the context of the general refinement planning framework  we can offer a rational basis for the generation of the various encodings. specifically  the natural place where sat solvers can be used in refinement planning is in the 
 solution extraction phase . as illustrated in figure 1  after doing k  complete  and  strongly progressive  refinements on a null plan  we get a planset whose minimal candidates contain all k-length solutions to the problem. so  picking a solution boils down to searching through the minimal candidates- which can be cast as a sat problem. this account naturally relates the character of the encodings to the type of refinements used in coming with the kth level planset and how the plansets themselves are represented. 

figure 1. relating refined plan at k-th level to satplan encodings. 
　kautz et. al. concentrate primarily on direct translation of planning problems to sat encodings  sidelining refinement planning  kautz et. al.  1   the only exception is their graphplan based encoding; see below . i believe that such an approach confounds two orthogonal issues:  1  reaching a disjunctive plan whose minimal candidates contain all the solutions and  1  posing the solution extraction as a sat problem. 
　it is best to separate these issues and see the main contributions of satplan as pertaining to the second one. the issues guiding the first are by and large specific to planning  and are best addressed in terms of refining disjunctive plans. the issues guiding the second are general heuristics regarding the effective ways of compiling a combinatorial 
kambhampati 
search problem into a sat instance  and are only loosely tied to planning. the main concern here is to end up with a sat instance that is  small   e.g.  in terms of number of variables . the techniques used to achieve this involve syntactic optimizations such as converting n-ary predicates into binary predicates  or compiling out dependent variables. 
separating planset construction and its compilation into a 
sat instance allows satplan techniques to exploit  rather than re-invent   disjunctive  refinement planning. it also removes the arbitrariness involved in  guessing  the length of the solution as a pre-requisite for coming up with a sat encoding  since solution extraction is interleaved with refinements. it may also be possible to develop heuristics that attempt to predict whether it is worth doing solution extraction on the current plan  as for example  graphplan does . 
　in addition  i speculate that basing encodings on kth level plansets may also lead to sat instances that are  smaller  on the whole. specifically  the pruning done by disjunctive refinements can also lead to a planset with fewer number of minimal candidates than can be achieved by direct encodings. this can in turn lead to a tighter sat encoding. my speculation is supported to some extent by the results reported in  kautz and selman  1  which show that sat encodings based on k-length planninggraphs generated by graphplan  can be solved more efficiently than the  linear  encodings generated by direct translation/ 
1. challenge problems 
the framework of relations that we have outlined in this paper gives rise to several open issues that are worth investigating. i pose them below as challenge problems to the researchers in the planning community: 
1 disjunctive refinements 
in section 1 argued that the success of graphplan can be interpreted in terms of the idea of disjunctive planning. the only implemented and widely tested disjunctive planner is graphplan  and it is based on forward state space refinements. given the known disadvantages of forward statespace refinements vis a vis the other goal directed refinements  it seems likely that disjunctive planners based on these other refinements may scale-up even better. this leads to the first challenge: 
challenge 1. develop disjunctive planners based on  1 a  backward state space   1 b  plan-space and  l.c  task reduction refinements  either working independently or in combination. 
　section 1 explicates some of the critical issues involved in implementing disjunctive planners  but a lot remains to be done. an easy first step in this direction would be to have a version of graphplan algorithm that uses backward state space refinements  which can in principle out-perform graphplan by being goal-directed . a more interesting step is to develop a disjunctive planner based on plan-space refinement  and see if the advantages of plan-space refinement over state-space ones in the traditional planners carry over to disjunctive planners. given the dominance of task reduction refinements in practical planners  it is also imperative to 
1  kautz and selman interpret the superior performance of graphplan encodings over linear encodings to the fact that the former allow action parallelism. however  as shown in  kambhampati & lambrecht  1   the real contribution of graphplan is not supporting parallel actions  but rather allowing forward state space refinements over disjunctive plans. 
al challenges. 
develop disjunctive planners based on task reduction refinement. finally  since interleaving refinements is known to have advantages in traditional planners  kambhampati & srivastava  1   it would be worth considering disjunctive planners that interleave refinements. the key in all these cases will be to handle the tradeoff between cost of the refinement and the loss of pruning power by generalizing the corresponding refinements to make them infer more than 
just action constraints. the discussion in section 1 may suggest some ideas in this regard. progress on the first challenge can put us at a good vantage point to answer a more global one: 
challenge 1. characterize tradeoffs offered by different refinements in supporting disjunctive planning. 
　the most interesting issues to be resolved here include whether and how the tradeoffs between the various refinements change when we shift from traditional refinement planners to disjunctive planners  c.f.  barrett & weld  1  : would plan-space and task-reduction refinements maintain their advantages over in disjunctive planning algorithms too  or would they be less effective  presumably because they do not support effective refinement and constraint propagation   the answer may depend on how effectively the corresponding refinements can be generalized to disjunctive plans. 
1 issues in sat compilation 
given that sat compilation seems to be the most promising way of doing solution extraction on disjunctive plans  development of effective disjunctive planners will require attention to the sat compilation issues. the problemindependent tradeoffs in sat compilation are the subject of a challenge paper by selman et. al.   and will not be discussed here. our interest here is to understand the specific compilation tradeoffs directly related to planning: 
challenge 1. characterize the tradeoffs offered by satencodings based on disjunctive plans derived by different types of refinements  alone or working in an interleaved combination . 
　the issues to be resolved here include understanding  1  how easy would it be to solve the sat encodings resulting from different refinements and  1  how to effectively exploit the shared structure of the sat encodings corresponding to successive levels of disjunctive plans. the first issue is especially interesting in light of the current experience that snlp encodings  despite being more compact  are harder to solve  selman et. al.  1 . the second issue is motivated by the fact that solution extraction is interleaved with incremental refinement operations  and thus the disjunctive plans at successive levels share a significant amount of substructure. indeed  one of the sources of efficiency for graphplan algorithm is the way the backward search phase on successive planning-graphs can use the information computed in the previous levels  e.g. memoizing . 
　it would also be interesting to understand why sat compilation is so effective in the first place. kautz and selman's  original arguments seemed to imply that the effectiveness has a lot to do with stochastic search methods used in solving sat problems. this implication been called into question by the recent results of bayardo and schrag   which show that systematic approaches can do just as well. so  a pertinent question is: is the compilation into sat justified purely by modularity concerns  in that different planning algorithms do not have to worry about specialized solution extraction procedures   or is there any inherent advantage to sat representation  a partial attempt at resolving this issue would be to enrich the backward search  solution extraction  phase of the graphplan algorithm with the csp techniques such as dependency directed backtracking  to see if it could rival the sat performance. 
1 the utility of controlled splitting 
in terms of our general refinement planning template  traditional planners split each of their component plans into a different search branch  while graphplan and satplan can be thought of in terms of not splitting the plansets at all. research in constraint satisfaction and operations research shows that pruning and splitting can have synergistic interactions. in fact  the best csp search strategies combine low-level constraint propagation  pruning  techniques  such as forward checking  with splitting  bayardo & schrag  1 . this raises the possibility that best disjunctive planners may also do controlled splitting of plansets  rather than no splitting at all  to facilitate refinements with more pruning power. controlled splitting may also be helpful in scenarios where planning and execution need to be interleaved of necessity. although some initial exploration has been done in this direction by descartes and ucpop-d planners  a more systematic analysis of tradeoffs is still needed. this leads to the next challenge: 
challenge 1. develop and explore the tradeoffs offered by planners that split some of the disjunction into the search space  while keeping the rest together in disjunctive format. 
　one immediate question is exactly how many branches should a planset be split into  since the extent of propagation depends on the amount of shared sub-structure between the disjoined planset components  one way of controlling splitting may be to keep plans with shared sub-structure together. of particular theoretical interest would be exhibiting domains and problems where full disjunction is counter-productive. a first step in this direction would involve experimenting with versions of graphplan algorithm that maintain multiple planning-graphs at each level  kambhampati & lambrecht  1 . 
1 exploring alternative representations 
we have noted in section 1 that there is nothing sacrosanct about the particular representation for partial plans that is used by most existing planners. alternative representations may either be dictated by necessity  for example  the time-map based plan representations used in planners like hsts  muscettola  1  to support the use of expressive resource constraints in planning   or as more flexible ways of representing and handling sets of action sequences  for example  the representation used in cops  ginsberg  1  . the general framework and ideas described in this paper are independent of the specific representations used for partial plans. for example  ginsberg's cops planner can be seen as an instance of the disjunctive planning approach  that uses a very different partial plan representation  albeit with the same candidate set semantics . the approach shares the ideas of direct refinement of disjunctive plans and solution extraction by enumerating minimal candidates. representations can however have a significant impact on the kinds of refinements that can be supported. ginsberg describes a type of refinement on his plan representation that has the ability compute both upper and lower approximations on the set of solutions. this leads us to an interesting  but somewhat open-ended challenge. 
challenge 1. develop and investigate the utility of alternative plan representations on the efficiency of plan generation. 
　while development of new representations is an openended task  a first feasible step in this direction would be to do a direct empirical comparison of currently available alternative representations  such as those used in cops or hsts. it would also be interesting to undertake each of the previous challenges in the context of the alternative representations. 
1. conclusion 
in this paper  i presented a generalized view of refinement planning that bridges several hither-to distinct strands of planning research. i have outlined how the insights from this unification can help both traditional and sat-based planners. finally  i have proposed as a challenge to the community  a set of research problems  tackling which can lead to a significantly improved understanding of the issues involved in efficient plan synthesis. 
　to support research into these challenge problems  i intend to maintain a web site that will act as a clearing house for information on our evolving understanding. its url will be http://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/challenge.html. this site will contain references to other relevant literature  pointers to benchmark problems and test-domains  as well as more fleshed out versions of the challenges and their upto-date status.
