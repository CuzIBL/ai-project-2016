	i 	introduction 
     the attending system is designed to c r i t i q u e a physician's plan for anesthetic management  and is c u r r e n t l y being used experimentally for teaching anesthesia r e s i d e n t s . t r a d i t i o n a l aim systems   k u l i k o w s k i   1; s h o r t l i f f e   buchanan  and feigenbaum  1  have been designed to simulate a physician's decision-making process. from a c l i n i c a l standpoint  these systems have the e f f e c t of t r y i n g to t e l l a physician how to p r a c t i c e medicine. 
     the attending system  	in c o n t r a s t   	l e t s the physician o u t l i n e the management he is contemplating  	and then t a i l o r s i t s advice around t h i s proposed approach. 	as a r e s u l t   whereas t r a d i t i o n a l systems t e l l the physician  	in 
e f f e c t    this is how i think you should manage your p a t i e n t .     attending says   this is what i think of your management p l a n .   
     a number of ai research projects have explored the analysis of plans. several of these 
 sussman  1; m i l l e r and g o l d s t e i n   1; rich  shrobe  and waters  1  have addressed the analysis of computer programs   h i g h l y s t y l i z e d plans to accomplish a t a s k   . two projects dealing with other types of plans are noah   s a c e r d o t i   1  and molgen   s t e f i k   1 . no previous system  however  has applied t h i s approach to medicine. 
this research was performed using the sumex-aim computer system  and was supported in part by nih grant 1 from the national l i b r a r y of medicine. 
     there are a number of p r a c t i c a l reasons why medical plan-analysis  mpa  may be a valuable modality for computer advice. 
1. the v a r i a t i o n inherent in medical p r a c t i c e . there are frequently several ways to approach a p a t i e n t ' s medical management  none necessarily r i g h t or wrong. even  suboptimal  approaches may 
be adequate. the u l t i m a t e choice a physician makes may be q u i t e s u b j e c t i v e : r e f l e c t i n g the standards of the community where he p r a c t i c e s   the i n s t i t u t i o n where he t r a i n e d   and his 
accumulated experience of what has worked well for him in the past. most physicians develop t h e i r own s t y l e s of p r a c t i c e   and would not t o l e r a t e a system which did not allow them to practice medicine in t h e i r accustomed fashion. 
1. the physician's u l t i m a t e r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for his p a t i e n t ' s care. mpa forces the physician to grapple with h i s p a t i e n t ' s problems himself  before t u r n i n g to the computer for assistance. since he must take the u l t i m a t e medical and medicolegal r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for his p a t i e n t   i t makes sense to give him the primary role in planning his p a t i e n t ' s care  and l e t the computer provide feedback to help evaluate and optimize his approach. 
1. a c c e p t i b i l i t y . mpa casts the computer in the role of a physician's a l l y   rather than a p o t e n t i a l competitor. 
	ii 	an example 
     the attending system implements medical plan-analysis in the domain of anesthesia  in both a c o n s u l t a t i o n mode and a t u t o r i a l mode. in the t u t o r i a l mode  the system f i r s t describes a h y p o t h e t i c a l p a t i e n t   for example: 
a seventy three year old man with a history 
of chronic hepatitis  mild renal failure  and 
three prior heart attacks  comes to emergency surgery for possible ischemic bowel. 
     the a n e s t h e t i s t then o u t l i n e s h i s plan by a 
     process of menu s e l e c t i o n . 	for example  	in t h i s case  he might propose: 	1. i n d u c t i o n of anesthesia with t h i o p e n t a l 	 a s h o r t - a c t i n g 
b a r b i t u a t e     1. rapid sequence i n t u b a t i o n using succinylcholine  a r a p i d - a c t i n g muscle r e l a x a n t     and 1. maintenance of anesthesia w i t h enflurane

 an i n h a l a t i o n a l a n e s t h e t i c     curare  a muscle r e l a x a n t     and n i t r o u s oxide. 	the attending system c u r r e n t l y c r i t i q u e s t h i s plan as 	f o l l o w s : 
there are a number of basic principles 
involved in this patient's management. 	first  in 
the presence of coronary artery disease  one must attempt to prevent hypotension and ischemia. 
second  a patient with a full stomach must be 
protected from aspiration . 	third  in a patient 
with chronic renal failure  one must consider the problem of renal toxicity and compromised renal 
excretion of drugs. also  in the presence of liver disease  one must attempt to prevent hepatic damage. 
intubation of this patient is definitely 
appropriate because of a full stomach. rapid sequence intubation is a reasonable approach. 
this might  however  have the risk of cardiac 
compromise. 	an alternative approach to rapid 
sequence intubation would be intubation after 
mask induction with cricoid pressure. this has the advantage of helping avoid hypotension. 
intubation after mask induction with cricoid 
pressure might well be preferable for a patient 
with coronary artery disease  if severe  since it 
allows more gradual induction with less danger of sudden cardiac decompensation. 
     in regard to induction  induction using thiopental involves the conceivable risk of hypotension due to cardiac depression. an 
alternative approach to induction using 
thiopental would be an inhalational induction. 
from the standpoint of maintenance  the 
choice of enflurane could have at least the 
theoretical risk of renal toxicity due to metabolic release of fluoride ion. 	an 
alternative would be halothane. 	here  however  in a patient with liver disease  there is the theoretical risk of halothane induced hepatotoxicity. 
looking at other aspects of the proposed 
plan  curare is well selected for a patient with 
chronic renal failure. 	one consideration worth 
mentioning  however  is that curare could have 
the risk of hypotension due to histamine release. 
	i l l 	risk: the heart of medical plan-analysis 
     to analyze a physician's management p l a n   as o u t l i n e d above  a computer must deal w i t h issues of r i s k in a comprehensive way. the assessment of r i s k and the evaluation of r i s k t r a d e o f f s l i e s at the heart of medical management. 
     in anesthesia  each underlying medical problem implies c e r t a i n r i s k s for a p a t i e n t ' s 
management. certain agents and techniques may increase these r i s k s   others may decrease them. furthermore  in complicated p a t i e n t s w i t h several problems  r i s k t r a d e o f f s frequently e x i s t . here  techniques which are b e n e f i c i a l f o r one problem may be d e t r i m e n t a l to another and v i c e - v e r s a . as a r e s u l t   to implement medical plan-analysis  a system must be able to assess  manipulate  and discuss r i s k in a general  f l e x i b l e way. 
	iv 	heuristic risk analysis: three principles 
     the conventional approach to r i s k a n a l y s i s   as used in economic c o s t / b e n e f i t analysis and c l i n i c a l decision analysis  weinstein e t a l .   1   reduces r i s k to numbers. the d i f f i c u l t i e s inherent in t h i s numeric approach to r i s k are w e l l recognized. f i r s t   it is hard to assign values to many outcomes. second  the l i k e l i h o o d values may be d i f f i c u l t to determine. in a d d i t i o n   it is o f t e n hard to know how general s t a t i s t i c s apply to a given p a t i e n t w i t h a p a r t i c u l a r set of medical problems. 
　　　instead of reducing the r i s k s of anesthetic management to numbers  attending uses a h e u r i s t i c 
　　　approach based on three p r i n c i p l e s   which are applied at each l e v e l of decision and sub-decision in analyzing a plan. these three p r i n c i p l e s are discussed in turn below  together w i t h attending's current implementation of each. as the development of attending continues  the implementation of the p r i n c i p l e s may w e l l be augmented and r e f i n e d . it is a n t i c i p a t e d   however  that the p r i n c i p l e s themselves w i l l 
remain constant. 
p r i n c i p l e 	i: 	rough c r i t e r i a eliminate obviously poor choices 
　　　if one o u t l i n e s a l l possible ways to accomplish a task  there are frequently choices which are c l e a r l y i n f e r i o r . when a person is the decision-maker  many of these may be weeded out at an unconscious l e v e l . attending uses rough estimates of the  magnitude  of a r i s k to help it e l i m i n a t e c l e a r l y i n f e r i o r a l t e r n a t i v e s . 
     each r i s k is assigned a rough magnitude: low  moderate  high  or extreme. thus  j u s t as many diagnostic systems use rough estimates of diagnostic l i k e l i h o o d to d r i v e t h e i r analyses   s z o l o v i t s and pauker  1   attending uses rough estimates of r i s k . formally  these 
magnitudes correspond to a rough estimate of a r i s k ' s l i k e l i h o o d m u l t i p l i e d by the value of i t s 
outcome. c l i n i c a l l y   r i s k magnitudes seem to conform n a t u r a l l y to the way an a n e s t h e t i s t thinks about r i s k s   and are therefore q u i t e easy to assign. 
p r i n c i p l e 1: 	domain-specific knowledge focuses 
a t t e n t i o n on the most c l i n i c a l l y 
	appropriate 	a l t e r n a t i v e s 
     using rough estimates of r i s k   attending is able to discard c l e a r l y poor choices. this broadbrush d i s c r i m i n a t i o n   however  may not be 
s u f f i c i e n t to l e t the system focus on the most c l i n i c a l l y appropriate a l t e r n a t i v e s f o r discussion w i t h the p h y s i c i a n . more s p e c i f i c knowledge may have to be brought to bear. 

	to allow more s e l e c t i v e 	focusing of 
attending's a t t e n t i o n   the system uses  contextual preference rules   cp r u l e s   . cp r u l e s allow attending to look at approaches which have the same r i s k magnitude  low  moderate  e t c .   and s e l e c t i v e l y focus on a preferred approach in a given context. each cp rule has four p a r t s   which r e s p e c t i v e l y state that 1  in the context of a p a r t i c u l a r medical problem  1  a 
c e r t a i n s p e c i f i e d technique is most l i k e l y preferred to 1  another s p e c i f i e d technique. the cp r u l e also states 1  the reason for the preference. 
     cp rules play two r o l e s . f i r s t   they allow attending to focus s e l e c t i v e l y on c e r t a i n approaches. second  if the physician has proposed a  less p r e f e r r e d   choice  a cp r u l e gives attending a reason it can use in j u s t i f y i n g i t s suggestion of the  more p r e f e r r e d   approach. 
p r i n c i p l e 1: 	discussion of relevant risks and 
benefits in a p e r t i n e n t   	natural way. 
     risks have many f a c e t s . not only do they have d i f f e r e n t magnitudes  they have other c h a r a c t e r i s t i c features which influence how the physician thinks about each r i s k   and therefore how that r i s k is best discussed. for instance  some r i s k s are v i r t u a l l y c e r t a i n   and others are remote. some are unanimously recognized  others are c o n t r o v e r s i a l . s t i l l others may be at best t h e o r e t i c a l   and o f l i t t l e p r a c t i c a l importance. some may be so obvious as to be i m p l i c i t in any discussion i n v o l v i n g them. 
     these c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s might most a p t l y be c a l l e d  pragmatic features  of r i s k s . each r i s k has i t s own set of pragmatic features. attending must know about these features if it is to discuss r i s k s i n t e l l i g e n t l y with the physician. 
     among the pragmatic features used by attending to characterize r i s k s a r e : 1. implicit: some r i s k s are i m p l i c i t in the techniques being described. 1. theoretical: some r i s k s have only t h e o r e t i c a l importance in that they probably never cause s i g n i f i c a n t harm  even though they may o f t e n influence a p a t i e n t ' s management. 1. remote: some r i s k s   although acknowledged as r e a l   may be perceived as remote p o s s i b i l i t i e s . 
     pragmatic features are necessary because the physician has d i f f e r e n t mental models of d i f f e r e n t r i s k s . wording must be chosen to 
t a i l o r the discussion to his mental models. if attending discusses a l l r i s k s in the same terms  then it sounds l i k e a school c h i l d r e c i t i n g facts 
which it has memorized but does not f u l l y understand. i f   on the other hand  the pragmatic features are used  and the discussion of each r i s k i s a p p r o p r i a t e l y m o d i f i e d   the a n e s t h e t i s t 
u s u a l l y doesn t notice that the discussion of d i f f e r e n t r i s k s i s being phrased d i f f e r e n t l y . 
　　　using the h e u r i s t i c approach o u t l i n e d above  attending is able to i d e n t i f y   manipulate  and

discuss 	the r i s k s involved 	in anesthetic 
management 	in a f l e x i b l e way. 
	v 	summary 
     the attending system implements medical plan-analysis in the domain of anesthesia  and is c u r r e n t l y being used experimentally for 
teaching. 	it 	is a n t i c i p a t e d that 	the approach 
can be productively extended i n t o other areas of medical management as w e l l . the a b i l i t y to deal f l e x i b l y with r i s k w i l l be a c e n t r a l component of these systems. 
     medicine is a r i c h domain for e x p l o r i n g issues of r i s k . 	c l e a r l y   however  	the development of a robust h e u r i s t i c approach 	to r i s k analysis w i l l have p o t e n t i a l 	a p p l i c a t i o n i n 
many areas other than medicine. the current attending implementation is a step in t h i s d i r e c t i o n .
