	1. 	introduction 
   a considerable amount of recent work in theorem-proving has been concerned 
with methods for increasing the power of inferences which can be made in special cases. this appears to be in response to the widespread recognition that general purpose theorem provers  p a r t i c u l a r l y those using resolution  as t h e i r inference r u l e   have extreme d i f f i c u l t y 
with particular aspects of proofs for which there are f a i r l y effective algorithms and h e u r i s t i c s . oustanding examples are equality  commutativity  and a s s o c i a t i v i t y . it is generally recognized that such properties are more e f f i c i e n t l y dealt with if they are somehow ' b u i l t in'; to the theorem prover  rather than proviced in the form of axioms. there i s   however  an understandable reluctance to destroy generali t y or completeness by ad hoc mechanisms. 
　　the usual approach has been to search for methods of replacing an axiom or a set of axioms with an inference r u l e . this has resulted in a number of suggested methods for treating equality  1 1  1 1 1   associativity and commutat i v i t y  1 1   and other properties  1 . one of the problems with equality is that proving two terms equal is in general as d i f f i c u l t as proving an arbitrary theorem - equality is undecidable  and any theorem can be expressed using just the equality predicate. associativity is not as d i f f i c u l t   but the fact that there are an i n f i n i t e number of ways of unifying terms involving associative functions gives rise to s i g n i f i c a n t problems. 
　　recently we have been looking at a method of incorporating axioms into 
inference rules which approaches this problem in a d i f f e r e n t way. the idea is to s p l i t an unsatisfiable set s of clauses into two d i s j o i n t subsets  say u and s-u  and to use a theorem prover working on clauses of u to generate 
inference rules which are applicable to clauses of s-u. if these inference rules are generated on demand  t h i s method is not necessarily r e s t r i c t e d to values of u for which an equivalent  f i n i t e set of inference rules are known. in this paper we discuss a simple inference rule called u-generalized-resolution which is complete for any subset u of s. 
　　this approach grew out of some discussions with david yarmush and norman rubin concerning the problem of equality. it was suggested that an appropriate generalization of resolution to deal with equalii t y consisted of generalizing the u n i f i c a t i o n procedure so that l i t e r a l s could be unified if they had the same predicate and a substitution could be found which would make the arguments equal  rather than i d e n t i c a l . since equality is in general undecidable  such a procedure would require the use of a theorem-prover within the u n i f i c a t i o n procedure. we discuss this approach to equality  which we c a l l u-equality-generalized resolution  in section 1. the 
more general approach  which we c a l l u-generalized resolution and which gives a framework for dealing with properties other than equality  is treated in section 1.
