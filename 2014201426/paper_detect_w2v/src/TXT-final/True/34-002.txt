 
the aim of our paper is to show that a general theory of i n t e l l i g e n t systems 	/ i s / can be based on the mathematical l o g i c and on i t s model theory. a d e s c r i p t i v e d e f i n i t i o n of is is g i v e n . one can see t h a t the i n v e s t i g a t i o n of some important aspects of is's f u n c t i o n i n g lead us to r e a l i z e the necessity of a general language concept. the d e f i n i t i o n of the language is given as a t r i p l e : language =  syntax  	set of possible 
worlds  	v a l i d i t y   . 
the usefulness of t h i s language concept f o r describing the is f u n c t i o n i n g is shown. mathematical background of t h i s concept gives 	the p o s s i b i l i t y f o r the foundation of the formal i s ' s theory.

the 	research of a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e / a i / is h i g h l y r a m i f i e d as it can be seen from 	 	and it doesn't have a u n i f i e d theory that would coordinate the d i f f e r e n t branches of researches and t h a t would provide the c o m p a t i b i l i t y of r e s u l t s 
one of the main reasons of the s u p e r f i c a l connection between the d i f f e r e n t research branches of ai is t h a t they make use of and develop the methods of various d i s c i p l i n e s   	i . e . 	psychology  mathematical l o g i c   	programming theory  	algorythmic theory  	p r o b a b i l i t y theory  	c o n t r o l theory  	l i n g u i s t i c s   e t c . of course t h i s 
d i v e r s i t y of d i s c i p l i n e s may also be explained by the f a c t that much e f f o r t is made on the s a t i s f a c t i o n of a c t u a l p r a c t i c a l requirements in the development of a i . 
i n our opinion i t i s necessary t o establ i s h a main theory based on mathematics so as to b r i n g these d i v e r s i v e researches onto common base or at l e a s t to have w e l l d e f i n i a b l e common p o i n t s in 
1 
them. such r o l e could be f u l f i l l e d by the so c a l l e d theory of i n t e l l i g e n t systems. this would provide methods f o r the i n v e s t i g a t i o n of the n a t u r a l and a r t i f i c i a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n o f 	the i n t e l l i g e n c e * this theory presupposes the abstract d e f i n i t i o n o f the i n t e l l i gence as weel  as it provides means for the d e s c r i p t i o n of the s t r u c t u r e and operation of such system. 
in t h i s study we give a d e s c r i p t i v e d e f i n i t i o n of the i n t e l l i g e n c e and we introduce such a d e f i n i t i o n of the language t h a t provides a u s e f u l means f o r the mathematical foundation of the theories of i n t e l l i g e n t systesm. i n t e l l i g e n t systems 	/ i s / 
so far there has been innumerous l i t e r a t u r e published i n connection 
w i t h is  	and i t s b r i e f summary can be 
found i n   1   . since the only one   i n t e l l i g e n t   system so f a r known is the human being therefore he o r   the society is focused in the concepts  and the c o g n i t i v e p r o cess has the c h i e f r o l e r e s p e c t i v e l y . 
here we t r y to give the i n t u i t i v e l e v e l   d e s c r i p t i v e d e f i n i t i o n o f the i s . f i r s t we define the concept of the system. we mean by system the manifold of such elements or u n i t s among which there is a r e g u l a t transport / o f energy  	i n f o r m a t i o n e . g . / and i t s e l e ments are d i f f e r e n t i a t e d and s p e c i a l i z e d . in other words there is a d i v i s i o n of functions among the elements of a system. the system i s open i f i t i s i n mutual e f f e c t w i t h i t s environment and it is closed in the contrary case. an open system may be passive w h i l e i t s f u n c t i o n i n g i f t h i s mutual e f f e c t 
realises only on behalf of the environment and it may be active if the system is able to effect i t e environment. the functioning of a system may odour on several different levels /energy  information  e . g . / . 
from the point of view of the i n t e l l i gence of the system the functioning on the informative level has a decivise role. the quality of t h i s functioning level differentiates the 1 from other systems even more  this differentiates between the interpretations of 1-s. so the is can be created by the desc r i p t i o n of functioning on the informat i v e l e v e l . in the following we shall always mean informative level by functioning unless otherwise defined. information is meant on the i n t u i t i v e level and therefore it i s n ' t defined separately. 
a system is i n t e l l i g e n t   if 
- i t s functioning ensures /provides/ the storing elaboration  transformation and generation of i n f o r mation and it can be represented through problemsolving processes. 
- i t s functioning always aims to reach certain actualized goals. this means that the system has a hierarchic of goals out of which several may be actualized or may be dominant in a given period. these goals influence the functioning of the system. 
- i t s functioning is controlled predicatevily i . e . the elaboration of the functioning plan precedes the execution of a concrete procedure. this w i l l build up the actual functioning from i t s components /elementary actions  e . g . / and it w i l l consider t h e i r expectable effect from the point of view of the actualized goals. 
- the system is double - it may be open or closed. 
as an open system it may be either active or passive. i t s functioning is characterized by the fact that the information obtained from an open system is proceeded as a closed system. from the structure of the is it is only required to ensure above functioning. 
here we note that specifications of is such as learning  or evolution suppose actualization of certain goals and a functioning to reach these. the functioning of the is is connected with i t s environment. therefore to obtain i t s actualized goals it is connected in most 
cases with certain knowledge acquired about the environment. we consider cognitive process as a function collecting information about- the environment. the cognitive process always aims to describe a kind of object  we note here that the cognition of is may direct to i t s e l f * the is may be in connection with other systems  thus there can be cooperative  c o n f l i c t i n g is-s. in our present study 
we investigate the functioning of an is in i t s effect on i t s environment and we neglect the fact that t h i s is may be in 
complicated r e l a t i o n with other is. 
i n t u i t i v e description of functioning of is 
as we have already mentioned the f u n c t i o ning of is is conneoted with the cognition of i t s environment. therefore the funcioning w i l l be discussed from the point of 
view of such an imaginary observer whom about we suppose that it possesses the necessary and complete description of the is and of i t s environment. f i r s t l e t ' s see the environment of the is from the point of view of the observer. this is pert of some kind of a world.

instead of defining the idea of world we give some examples* a tree  a room  the nature can all be worlds. the investigated 1 can also be the part of the world containing its environment. the is does not know the world in its totality and it cannot got acquainted v/ith i t . the reason of this is that the world is infinitely complex  e.g. in its material structure. but in the same time this world is the element of an infinite set of worlds. e.g. such cot of worlds are the possible trees  possible rooms  etc. the 1 con exajnine a finite subset of the set of worlds in its cognitive process and as we have mentioned it can investigate only that much  as the invironment reflects from them. instead of using the expression environment we shall be using the expression world  because cognition is focused on the world and the environment is a part of it accessable for the is. considering the characteristics of is we face the following dialectic contradiction: 
/ i / the world is infinite  infinitely complex etc. 
/ i i / the is is finite but extendable without limits. in other words we can view the system as having a finite alphabet and a finite memory e.g. a finite number of sheets of papers with marks  sentences etc. on it. the system can always produoe new sheets. write new sentences on these and invent new symbols into its alphabet but nevertheless the information actually written down in papers is finite. 
/see for analogy a turing machine*/ 
the representation of the world  and the representation of the connection between the world and the is should explioitely reflect the contradiction described above. thus the representation should reflect the information the system has about the world and also the uncertanity /lack of information/ of the system about the world* we can represent this by defining the class of all possible worlds which are compatible with the system's present knowledge. 
1o if we are given the system's present knowledge in internal terms  that is in terms of thoughts /strings of symbols and algorithms which are again strings of symbols/  the external representation of the system's uncertanity is the class of all worlds which are possible from the system's subjective point of view. the system only knows that the real world 
it lives in is one of these possible worlds. /this uncertainty is not always negative  since there are things which the system does not want to know about symply because they are utterly irrelevant for all its purposes. this positiveness of uncertainty will be described later as the  choice of the adequate abstraction ./ during knowledge aquisition the class of possible worlds gets smaller and smaller. however this class will never be finite and the goal of the system is not simply to make the class of possible worlds as simple as possible but rather to make this class to have certain properties. of course this will be done by making the class of possible worlds smaller  but then there will always be an orientation in it which is more subtle. 
let us now invescigate the role of a general concept of language in the description of the cognitive process of an is. language must be able to describe the possible worlds to some extent  hence it must be based on a finite set of symbols and rules /grammar/ that underline the formation of expressions suitable for the description of the different properties of 
 

some or other worlds. 
thus a language must consist of a syntax /grammar/ and a semantics /meaning  denotation/. syntax consists of a set of strings of symbols / t e x t s / and the system of rules working on these texts. semantics of the language characterizes the connection between the syntactically expressions and the possible worlds. it consists of a pair of the set of a l l possible worlds and validity. consequently a language must contain the following components: 
language =  syntax  set of possible worlds  validity    that is symbols a language l is a t r i p l e : 
l = f  m  k   where p is the set of the possible thoughts /sentences/  m is the class of a l l possible worlds and k defines the meaning /the denotation/ of the sentences in the worlds. generally k is a function with domain f x m which to each thought - world pair gives the meaning of that thought in that world. for example the meaning of a declarative sentence in a world might simply be a truth value /a yes or a no/; the meaning of a noun / i n a world/ might be an object in that world. to apply mathematics we should represent every object of the system in consideration by a mathematical object. that is f should be a set of mathematical objects / t h i s is easy to satisfy/  m should be a class of mathematical objects /and k is already defined as a function so it is a mathematical object/. to choose m is the most d i f f i c u l t and most important step in mathematical logic. to choose the mathematical objects constituting m means to choose the mathematical representation of the world /or more precisely the class of possible worlds/. for example the difference between classical logic  modal logic  temporal logic etc  can be originated 
from choices of m. having chosen m  we find that f /and k/ is similar to the problem of finding an adequate form to a content. e.g. different f-s might be more or less adequate to m and also might have more or .less expressive power for m. the mathematical objects in m are called models  beoause they are only the mathematical models of the possible real worlds. 
accordingly  model theory  is that branch of mathematical logic which concentrates on the models /on m/ and investigates the relationship between the models and the syntax of the language. in other words model theory is the mathematical science of semantics. the study of li in i t s own right /without considering i t s role in the language and in the thinking process/ is called universal algebra. the study 
of f is a purely syntactical exercise  and it involves the theory of algorithms and grammars. 
some of the failures of early automatic theorem proving were caused by the fact that the logicians concentrated much more on the syntax / f / than on the semantics. /of course  by purely syntact i c a l means  by simply combining the elements of f into new elements we get conginatorical algorithms which are rather inefficient/. 
the importance of the choice of m is also well illustrated by some recent critics of logic. usually the criticism 
was that this and this cannot be represented /investigated/ by logic. but in a l l such cases a certain fixed system was understood by logic and the cause of the impossibility of representation was the given choice of m. mathemat i c a l logic however is not devoted to the investigation of a unique  prespecified language  f  m  k  but instead  

it investigates the properties of such languages /and also systems of such languages/ in general and gives tools to construct that concrete language which is adequate in some given situations or problemdomain. 
these tools give the pragmatic aspect of language. it is also true that in doing so mathematical logic investigates some fixed languages in very great detail  the reasons for which is that certain languages turned out to be rather practical kernel-stones for nearly a l l other languages. such a kernel-stone is the classical first-order logic  
low we turn back to the concept of language. .1e note  that the concept of language in itself is not enough to the investigation of the is  but is an indispensable building-block in this investigation. the concept of a deductive logic w i l l be much closer  but it w i l l be s t i l l a building 
block only  we also note that an is is not supposed to function in one fixed language  it might have many different languages or hierarchies of languages and the ability of generating new ones  etc  
a state of knowledge of an is  using the language  f  m  k  is represented by a set of sentences  that is by a subset of f. is that explicit knowledge which has already been formulated by the is. now the set of possible worles for the is is the set of those elements of m which are compatible with /since the is already knows that 
1o far we have described the basic reason why the whole structure of logic is based upon is a class of possible worlds. we said that the is simply does not know which is the real one /and in certain respects the is does not want to know/. however  there are more subtle reasons 
for having a class of possible worlds and also these classes play more subtle roles in the investigation of cognition. 
it might be the case that the is investigates many different parts of the world independently. it treats these parts of the 
world as independent worlds. /of course this means that the is is not using always the same language since one language is 
used to  live in these worlds  and another is needed to go to one of these world  then leave i t   go to another or do quite different things  e.t.c./ 
if the is considers these worlds analogoues somehow and decides to make use of this analogy  then it forms a language the models of which are these worlds  together with potentially existing parts of the world which might be visited by the is sometimes in the future. thus the variety of different situations where the is wants to apply the same knowledge. e.g. for a carpenter each piece of furniture is a different world where the carpenter applies 
the same knowledge. of course there might be special pieces of furniture which require some additional specific knowledge /and language  of course/ but the role of the language is not changed by this  only the complexity of the system of interacting languages has risen a b i t . 
all this means that the formation of a new language /from the existing ones/ during some problemsolving processes i.e. during the operation is more frequent. of course formation is a new language is also caused by the basic process  when the is investigates the same world and the variety is purely caused by absence of knowledge. 
now we only mention that there are other s t i l l more subtle generators of the variety of possible worlds. one of these is the following: the is can /and in many situations must/ view the same piece of 
1 

the real world in infinitely many d i f f e rent ways / e . g . we can investigate the atomic structure of a tree  i t s statical properties  we can view the armchair as a world in which lots of different bugs can live  or its sensitivity for f i r e   how it conducts heat or electricity  etc./. prom the logical point of view these are different worlds /certainly they give ribe to different models/ which in the same time are just aspects and abstraction levels of the same complex world  that is they can /and should by syntetised  or organised into one. 
of course these different ways of looking upon the same object might give birth to different languages  but there also might be different worlds of the same language /as in the case of interdisciplinary sciences happens/  and also might be synthetised into one complex world of one language. 
conclusion 
as it could be seen from above the new language concept can provide adequate methods for the formal description of cognitive process of the is. 
by this we wished to point out that the research of is can be the real user of present researches in mathematical logic  the newest achievements of mathematical logic may become a suitable base for creating a unified theory of is. this theory can only be accomplished by the coordination of researches in mathematical logic and in is.
