 the linear structure of an image is apparent by inspection of figure 1. that ridgepoints should be so effective is  in a sense  a  psychological discovery.  it would appear that ridgepoints are important perceptual primitives which may play a significant role in a variety of other tasks  e.g.  perception of surface shape . a significant feature of  ridgepoints  is that their locations are independent of any monotonic intensity transformation of the image  and their geometric configuration is independent of a change of scale. these are precisely the properties we would expect of a perceptual primitive  but are 
lacking in the commonly employed gradient dependent primitives  such as  edgepoints.
