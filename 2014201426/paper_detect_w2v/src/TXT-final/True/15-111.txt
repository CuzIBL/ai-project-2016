       new concept based on only one input example  although l a t e r inputs might r e s u l t i n refinement of learned concepts. these f e a t u r e s are made poss i b l e by t a k i n g a very knowledge-based approach. 
	i. 	introduction 
       this paper gives an overview of a l e a r n i n g technique being developed at the u n i v e r s i t y of i l l i n o i s . the technique  c a l l e d explanatory schemes a c q u i s i t i o n has some i n t e r e s t i n g propert i e s . for example  it does not r e q u i r e a teacher o r other oracle t o seleot important examples; i t is capable of one t r i a l l e a r n i n g ; and c o n t r a r y to m i t o h e l l ' s recent taxonomy of l e a r n i n g systems  it does l i t t l e or no searching in the p r o cess of a c q u i r i n g a new concept. 
　　　before d e s c r i b i n g the technique we w i l l pause b r i e f l y to consider what we might c a l l the   s t a n -
dard theory of concept f o r m a t i o n .   this approach u n d e r l i e s much of the concept l e a r n i n g work in psychology and a i . in the standard theory  a system is given a number of i n p u t s . each input has some s t r u c t u r e . part of the s t r u c t u r e is essent i a l f o r the concept  part can be v a r i e d . an input w i t h the proper s t r u c t u r e is an instance of the concept; otherwise it is not an instance. a teacher  u s u a l l y a human  s u p p l i e s sample i n p u t s to the system together w i t h the i n f o r m a t i o n of which concept   i f any  the input is a concept o f . the system's task is to discover the s t r u c t u r e t h a t defines each concept. this approach has been f r u i t f u l l y applied to many diverse domains   f o r example    1       1       1     and is a cornerstone of the f i e l d o f i n d u c t i v e i n f e r e n c e . 
       now we can ask how we might c o n s t r u c t an untutored concept l e a r n i n g system. a t f i r s t t h i s seems a b i t of a non s e q u l t u r . removing the teacher appears t o r e s u l t i n n o l e a r n i n g a t a l l . also the n o t i o n of forming a concept from a s i n g l e i n p u t seems suspicious. 
	this work was supported 	in 	p a r t 	by 	the 	a i r 
foroe o f f i c e of s c i e n t i f i c researoh under grant f1-k-1 and in part by the n a t i o n a l s c l enoe foundation under grant nsf 1st 1. 
       the key is to adopt a much more knowledgebased approach. the l e a r n i n g a l g o r i t h m to be described requires access to a large amount of domain knowledge. it is through r e c o n c i l i n g a new input to the domain knowledge that l e a r n i n g and 
g e n e r a l i z a t i o n 	occurs. 
       this is not to say t h a t the proposed l e a r n i n g technique is domain s p e c i f i c . techniques s p e c i f i c to a p a r t i c u l a r domain would be ad hoc and of very l i m i t e d t h e o r e t i c a l i n t e r e s t . rather  explanatory schema a c q u i s i t i o n is domain independent. indeed  it has already been applied to three very d i f f e r e n t domains. the approach does  however  r e q u i r e access to a r i c h domain model. it is i n t e r a c t i o n w i t h t h i s r i c h domain i n f o r m a t i o n t h a t determines whether or not concept a c q u i s i t i o n is possible or d e s i r a b l e f o r a new i n p u t . the i n t e r a c t i o n also guides the g e n e r a l i z a t i o n p r o cess. 
	i i . 	explanatory schema acquisition 
　　　the process involves three l o g i c a l l y d i s t i n c t  but possibly concurrent  processes: 
1  the new input is understood. 
1  the input is evaluated to see if schema formation i s warranted. 
1  the input is generalized to a new schema. 
       for i l l u s t r a t i v e purposes we w i l l assume that the input is the f o l l o w i n g b r i e f n a t u r a l language s t o r y . the assumption of n a t u r a l language input is not necessary and  indeed  one of the current a p p l i c a t i o n s involves robot arm planning which  of course  i s n o n - l i n g u i s t i c . 
john  a bank t e l l e r   discovered t h a t h i s boss  fred  had embezzled $1. john sent fred an i n t e r - o f f i c e memo saying t h a t he would inform the p o l i c e unless he was given $1. fred paid john the money. 
a. understanding the i n p u t 
       the requirements on the understanding prooess are not c o n t r o v e r s i a l . by  understanding  we mean nothing more than o o n s t r u o t i n g a c a u s a l l y complete r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of the i n p u t . this requires t h a t any c r u c i a l i n f o r m a t i o n missing from the s t o r y must be i n f e r r e d and t h a t the causal r e l a t i o n s between components be discovered and made e x p l i c i t . while t h i s i s not a n easy task  i t i s one which has been the focus of a good deal of researoh  p a r t i c u l a r l y f o r n a t u r a l language t e x t s     1       1     . 

　　　we require that our representation have one component that is not generally inoluded by understanding systems. we require that the understander maintain data dependency links     1       j u s t i f y i n g each element in the representation. the links connect each representation event with a l l of the inference rules from the domain model that were used to justify the event during the understanding process. this includes a l l causal information  goal enablements  planning informat i o n   etc. this makes explicit in the f i n a l story representation the reasons the system had for connecting events in a particular way. for example  in the blackmail story john's demanding that fred give him $1 is e x p l i c i t l y mentioned. the system must infer that john has the goal of possessing the $1. this is a necessary inference. a system cannot be said to have  understood  the input  in any sense of the word  if it does not make this inference. 
　　　by and large  current understanding systems do not include these backpointers to inference rules in the f i n a l representation. we w i l l insist that they be e x p l i c i t l y stated in the understood representation. we c a l l the amalgam of a l l of these data dependency links the inference j u s t i f i cation network. 
b. to 	generalize or not to generalize 
　　　there are five aspects to be considered when deciding whether or not to generalize an input into a new schema. by hypothesis we w i l l assume that the input did not match an existing schema   i f it had then the system already possesses the desired schema and indeed that schema would have been used to process the story . if any of these five conditions does not hold  constructing a new schema from this input is inappropriate. 
the c r i t e r i a are: 
1  is the main goal of a character achieved  
1  is the goal a general one  
1  are the resources required by the goal achiever generally available  
1  is this new method of achieving the goal at least as effective as the other known v o l i t i o n a l sohemata to achieve this goal  
1  does the input match one of the known generalizable patterns  
　　　these c r i t e r i a are tested for a l l goals in the story. the f i r s t c r i t e r i o n  was the goal achieved   is self explanatory and easily judged. the second  is it a general goal   and the third 
 are the resources generally available   require some discussion. 
　　　novelty alone in an approaoh to aohieving a goal is not sufficient to warrant constructing a new sohema. consider  for example  a plot from the  mission impossible  television series. these plots are very novel but too specific to be useful again. 
	how can the u t i l i t y of a particular 	goal 	be 
judged  the answer to this is olosely tied to where goals come from. aohieving a goal which arises from general conditions important to an individual's well-being and using readily a v a i l -
g. dejong 1 
able resources is l i k e l y to result in an interesting new schema  one which w i l l arise again and again. for the solution  we use an aspect of schank and abelson's theory of planning . in their view themes give rise to the highest level goals  goals which are not simply subgoals in the achievement of other goals . interpersonal and life themes are what we are interested i n . an example of the former is a husband offering  and therefore  at some level  wanting  to type a term paper for his over-worked student wife. people often work to satisfy the goals of their loved ones. the system should realize that this requires no further explanation on the part of the husband. examples of the l a t t e r are attempting to satisfy one's hunger  to gain money  or to relieve boredom. life themes give rise to goals that require no further j u s t i f i c a t i o n . our example  which demonstrates a new way to gain money  relates directly to a l i f e theme and therefore satisfies this c r i t e r i o n . 
　　　criterion 1 is self-explanatory. the idea is that the system should not bother constructing schemata that are much less e f f i c i e n t than similar already-known schemata. 
　　　the f i f t h c r i t e r i o n has been discussed elsewhere   1   . as this is a short paper describing on-going research it is not appropriate to repeat it here. suffice it to say that there is a taxonomy of explanatory acquisition techniques. the teohnique that is matched has implications for exactly how the generalization is performed. c. the generalisation process 
	assuming the input is 	completely 	understood 
 with data dependency links to inference rules j u s t i f y i n g the understanding  and the five tests for learning have a l l been met  we must now perform the actual generalization. the generalization process oonsists of replacing the objects and actions in the understood representation with abstract counterparts. these counterparts are the most abstract possible while s t i l l preserving the v a l i d i t y of the inference j u s t i f i c a t i o n network. 
　　　consider again the example of john blackmailing fred. one proposition that is a part of the understood representation is that fred decided to pay john $1. this action is j u s t i f i e d to the system by a number of other propositions. among these supporting propositions are some supplied by the schema decide  which we assume the system already possesses . these inferences from decide are: 1  the decider must be at least a higher animate  1  the decider must be oapable of a number of alternative possible actions  1  the decider must know what the alternatives are  and 1  the chosen alternative w i l l be among the most beneficial/least detrimental to the decider. 
　　　thus  these  and other  j u s t i f i c a t i o n s are tied to the representation of fred's decision through data dependenoy links. fred's deoision is believable to the system beoause fred  in fact  is a higher animate  he knows at least two alternatives - paying john or losing the $1 and being arrested  and 1  he probably sees losing $1 as less detrimental than losing $1 and going to j a i l . these j u s t i f i c a t i o n s are sup-

plied in the form of pointers to the above inferenoe rules during the understanding procedure. 
　　　the generalization prooess substitutes general entities for the specific objects and events that occurred in the story. the entities are the most general possible that s t i l l preserve the validity of the data dependency inference. 
　　　through these and other generalizations the system can construct a f i r s t version of a blacknail schema. the schema might not be perfect. there may be later stories that do not quite f i t and require further modification of the schema. however  it is a reasonably general schema that is l i k e l y to help a good deal in processing future similar stories. 
i i i . c o n c l u s i o n 
there are several concluding points 
1  unlike many learning systems  e.g.    1         explanatory schema acquisition does not depend on correlational evidence. it is capable of one t r i a l learning  but the learning is not based on analogical reasoning like  and . it is somewhat similar to soloway's view of learning 
. there is also some resemblance to the macrops notion in the strips system   1   . 
1  the approach is heavily knowledge-based. a great deal of background knowledge must be present for learning to take place. in this respect explanatory schema acquisition follows the current trend in ai learning and discovery systems perhaps traoeable to lenat . 
1  the learning mechanism is not  failure-driven  as is the mops approaoh      1       1     . in that view learning takes place in response to incorrect predictions by the system. in explanatory acquisition learning is usually stimulated by positive inputs which encounter no particular problems or prediction failures. 
1  the absolute representation power of the system is not enhanced by learning new schemata. this statement is only superficially surprising. indeed  fodor  shows that this must be true of a l l self-consistent learning systems. explanatory schema acquisition does  however  increase processing efficiency. since a l l real-world systems are resource limited  this learning technique does  in fact  increase the system's processing power.
