a. 	introduction 
     to date  the dominant area in robot sensing research has been v i s i o n . notable exceptions include the force feedback or active accommodation work done in connection with the task of peg i n s e r t i o n   e . g .   1   and   1     and the use of vision and force sensing in assembly   1       1       1      and  1  passive accommodation . other areas of sensor research include range finding techniques    1  proximity sensing and some l i m i t e d investigations into the use of t a c t i l e force sensor arrays in manipulation  see below . for a comprehensive review of the current state of robot sensor technology the reader is referred to

     an area receiving limited attention in the l i t e r a t u r e   but comprising an important area in and of i t s e l f is that of the use of t a c t i l e sensory data in the control of robot systems. research in t h i s area has been in progress  and for further discussions  the reader is referred to  and recent work by dixon  1. research in the use of t a c t i l e data by robot manipulators has been generally l i m i t e d to gross force sensing in the w r i s t   and in some cases the f i n g e r s   for two general reasons. f i r s t   u n t i l r e c e n t l y   there has been a lack of high resolution sensing arrays which could be u t i l i z e d in the end effectors of a manipulator. second  and probably more important  people are far less conscious of the role that the  sense of touch'' plays in everyday a c t i v i t y   as compared to v i s i o n . while vision may continue to

be the primary sense u t i l i z e d in robots  t a c t i l e sensing f i l l s an important r o l e   not only when vision is inapplicable due to inherent ambiguities  but in the very fine control of d e l i c a t e 
manipulation. 
     t a c t i l e sensors can be divided into three general categories depending upon the type of information they provide. contact sensors compose the f i r s t class and y i e l d information i n d i c a t i n g either the presence or absence of physical s t i m u l i . a robot hand with contact sensing on several sides was developed by goto  1 to handle blocks placed on a t a b l e . in l a t t e r work  garrison and wang   1   constructed a hand containing an array of contact sensors. recent sensor arrays have u t i l i z e d woven graphite fibers as the physical transducer  1. the laboratory for automation and systems analysis at cnrs in toulouse  france  has developed an   a r t i f i c i a l skin  t a c t i l e sensor suitable for gross object recognition  1. a high spatial resolution conductive rubber contact sensing array has been developed at the a r t i f i c i a l intelligence laboratory at m.i.t. and has been successfully used to i d e n t i f y a b o l t from i t s contact pattern  1. 
     the second category contains the sensors which provide information regarding the magnitude of the force at each sensing point. a hand constructed by h i l l and sword  1 employed analog force sensing arrays. several of the contact sensing arrays mentioned above can and are being extended to provide analog force images. depending upon the compliance of the material supporting such sensors  
the force information can be related to the amount of d e f l e c t i o n of the sensor  thus providing information describing the three dimensional shape 
of the object being sensed. 
1      the f i n a l class of t a c t i l e sensors provides t h i s information d i r e c t l y . this group consists of sensors which are designed to transduce the three dimensional shape of an object. page and pugh  1 presented a sensor which builds a contour map of the object being sensed as the sensor is lowered onto the object. takeda constructed a hand with arrays of free f l o a t i n g needles as sensors. the needles would conform to the shape of the surface being touched  thereby providing i d e n t i f i c a t i o n information  1. 
b. 	the tactile sensor 
　　this section describes the physical and electrical characteristics of the conductive elastomeric tactile sensor currently being investigated by the authors in the digital corporate research group. the sensor is designed to provide an analog image of the forces produced when an object comes in contact with the sensor. the columns are arranged in a square matrix with their center to center spacing equal to .1 inches  providing a resolution of 1 detectors per square inch of sensor surface. along the upper surface of the sensor  the force elements are connected by fine wire in such a way as to form 1 rows. the sensor rests on a printed circuit board which provides connection in the orthogonal direction. the matrix is scanned by an lsi-1 computer which collects the data and provides some i n i t i a l preprocessing. 
　　as indicated by larcombe  and hillis   sensing of a single pressure point is possible in an array as just described. however  complex force patterns are d i f f i c u l t to understand due to the electrical interconnection of the individual force detecting elements. this problem is alleviated in the present design by the insertion of a diode in series with each of the elements. 
　　the scanning process produces a raster of force values that we call a  force image . of cource any sampling sequence is possible since the sensor is a random access device. the values returned are proportional to the resistance across the force detector connected to the selected digital line. since the resistance is proportional to compression of the element  the value returned is an indication of the force being experienced at that detector. the diodes eliminate interference due to alternate current paths in the network. 
　　the second function of the computer is to provide some preprocessing of the raw sensor data. this includes the removal of the offsets of the individual detectors  scaling of the data  and the removal of nonlinearities. the change in resistance of the detectors versus the amount of force applied is nonlinear. the degree of nonlinearity and the range over which the detector is applicable is the subject of a series of ongoing tests. experiments are also being performed to determine the effects of ambient temperature changes and d r i f t of the resistance during prolonged application of force. all of these characteristics have yet to be understood but the i n i t i a l test results are quite favorable. 
c. 	sensor data 
　　this section presents some of the force image data produced by the sensor. the sensor was mounted on a circuit board and placed on a table. a stimulus was applied to the sensor by pressing the object to be sensed down onto the sensory surface. the computer was programmed to continually scan the sensor and store each image in a f i l e . the images were later transported to a vax 1*computer where they were displayed on a color graphics terminal ana a plotter.

　　the most common usage for such sensors is to record the static image produced by an object. figures 1 through 1 contain grey scale representations of four static force images produced by various stimuli. each grey scale display is composed of a square array of 1  forcels   force elements   one corresponding to each force detector in the sensor  where the brightness of the forcel is proportional to the force at the corresponding element. figure 1 is the image produced when a spherical object is pressed onto the sensor. note that there are three bad forcels in the image: the element in the upper left corner and the two near the center of the pattern of forces produced by the stimulus. figure 1 resulted when a long thin cylinder was used as the stimulus. the force image of a plate with a hole through it appears in figure 1 and figure 1 shows a  v  shaped object depressing the sensor.

             hemispherical object.

               grey scale force image produced by the jaws of a pair of p l i e r s . 
     another form of data can be collected with t h i s sensor and computer system. that i s   the sensor can be used to record the sequence of force images r e s u l t i n g when an object moves across the sensory surface. figure 1 contains four consecutive force images collected as a c y l i n d r i c a l object r o l l e d across the sensor from the upper l e f t corner. the motion of the object is c l e a r l y v i s i b l e and measureable r e l a t i v e to the sensor. thus  if the sensor had been mounted on a robot gripper  the motion of the stlmuls would be d i r e c t l y available to the computer system c o n t r o l l i n g the robot. notice again the bad f o r c e l s . 
     the grey scale representation is one possible form for the display of such data. recall that the forces produced are proportional to the d e f l e c t i o n of the sensor. it is then reasonable to plot the data as a surface where the height of the point corresponding to an individual force detector is proportional to the force at that l o c a t i o n . figures 1 through 1 correspond to the grey scale representations shown in figures 1 through 1. 
	d. 	use of the data 
     the t a c t i l e sensor provides the host computer with an array of numbers  or a  force image   representing the magnitudes of the forces being applied across the sensory surface. the question now becomes one of how the control structures of the robot system are to u t i l i z e t h i s information. one such use is to provide accurate information regarding the i d e n t i t y   p o s i t i o n   and o r i e n t a t i o n of the object being touched. 
     in p a r t i c u l a r   given the geometric description of the surface of an object  the exact location and o r i e n t a t i o n in space of the object can be derived from arrays of such lensors. the array of force values may be thought of as comprising a set of control points for a surface patch  1. this patch can be compared with the representation of the surface of the object  thus allowing determination of the location and o r i e n t a t i o n of the corresponding patch on the object. the accuracy in t h i s case is l i m i t e d by the possible placements of the surface patch on the object due to symmetry. when two or more fingers are u t i l i z e d   the force images represent very localized views of the complete object. each view provides the o r i e n t a t i o n of a subpatch on the object. further information is available from the known spatial relationships between the force sensing arrays at the ends of the f i n g e r s . in t h i s case the subpatches are constrained in t h e i r r e l a t i v e locations in space. one has very localized samplings of the surface contour d e t a i l by the force sensing arrays and global sampling of the contour by knowing the relationships between the finger t i p s . this information can be used to determine the position of the object  configuration of the grasp  e t c . 
     a l l of the work cited e a r l i e r and the approach outlined in the discussion above have one basic 
idea in common. that i s   the information sensed is s t a t i c . the sensors are employed to take a  snapshot  of the environment which is then processed to y i e l d the desired information. the concept of touch extends beyond t h i s to include the sensing and analyzing of the dynamic c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the t a c t i l e information. consider  for example  the case when one reaches behind a coffee cup and   f e e l s   for the handle. in many cases p a r t i a l matching in one sensory modality  e . g . v i s i o n   may e l i c i t actions which focus sensors in other modalities in the area containing the object in question. biological evidence of t h i s comes with both foveation   i n v i s i o n     and exploration with the glabrous skin in hapsis. this allows i n i t i a l hypotheses to be confirmed by obtaining additional sensory information. 
     just as s t a t i c image processing techniques could be applied to s t a t i c force images  moving image analysis techniques could be applied to dynamic force images. consider the increase in resolution or reduction in noise that can be obtained by comparison of sequential visual images. one would expect similar improvements with dynamic force sensed images. although no r e s u l t s are given for such processing  experiments are underway to evaluate i t s a p p l i c a b i l i t y .
