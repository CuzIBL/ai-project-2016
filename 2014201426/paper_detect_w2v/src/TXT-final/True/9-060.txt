     a method is proposed f o r p a r t i t i o n i n g input scenes i n t o regions in which s e l e c t e d p i c t u r e p r o p e r t i e s are regarded as u n i f o r m . in t h i s procedure  usual s t a t i s t i c a l methods o f i n specting average gray l e v e l s are not used  but the u n i f o r m i t y of complex p i c t u r e propert i e s such as shapes  sizes or arrangements of subpatterns in the p i c t u r e s is examined by a s t r u c t u r a l a n a l y s i s . the analyzing process is c o n t r o l l e d by a supervisor which gives the order of changing the depth of i n t e r e s t in each p i c t u r e p r o p e r t y   and successive p a r t i t i o n i n g of the p i c t u r e s is made toward an i n t e r p r e t a b l e goal p a r t i t i o n .

     in recent years  many i n t e r e s t i n g papers on automatic scene analysis systems have been 
published f o r the r e c o g n i t i o n o r i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of three dimensional o b j e c t s . most of t h e i r methods transform d i g i t i z e d p i c t u r e s i n t o l i n e drawings  which are then analyzed and matched to one of models of the o b j e c t s . the importance of the t r a n s f o r m a t i o n is widely known  because the success of the recognit i o n procedures h i g h l y depends on the c o r r e c t ness of the l i n e drawings. roberts is the f i r s t man who applied a l o c a l edge operator to f i n d p o i n t s where abrupt change in gray l e v e l s seems to occure. he then f i t t e d s t r a i g h t l i n e s to these p o i n t s   and e x t r a c t e d the l i n e drawings from the input p i c t u r e s . 1 
his technique has been improved to f i n d b e t t e r edge d e t e c t o r s and l i n e f i n d e r s . 
     brice and fenneman proposed another elegant method f o r the t r a n s f o r m a t i o n of gray scale p i c t u r e s i n t o l i n e drawings by breaking the d i g i t i z e d p i c t u r e s i n t o atomic regions o f u n i form gray s c a l e   which are j o i n e d i n t o regions by a p a i r of h e u r i s t i c s . 1 the procedure is successful to a class of input p i c t u r e s   and each region obtained by these h e u r i s t i c s c o i n cides w i t h t h a t human eyes perceive as one homogeneous r e g i o n . colors in the p i c t u r e s are also important f o r v i s u a l p e r c e p t i o n and one can u t i l i z e c o l o r i n f o r m a t i o n instead of b r i g h t n e s s t o f i n d u n i f o r m c o l o r r e g i o n s . 1 
     these approaches  however  assume t h a t each plane of the objects and background has almost u n i f o r m b r i g h t n e s s or c o l o r   and cons i d e r a b l e m o d i f i c a t i o n i s necessary i f one

　　observing a scene in which many o b j e c t s are covered by p a t t e r n s or t e x t u r e s   a human being can e a s i l y recognize each object if it has a d i f f e r e n t p a t t e r n or t e x t u r e on it from those of adjacent ones. in other words  hu-
man v i s u a l systems pay t h e i r a t t e n t i o n to some p i c t u r e p r o p e r t i e s   and f i n d a region such that these p r o p e r t i e s of the subregions or elements in it are considered to be almost u n i f o r m . these selected p i c t u r e p r o p e r t i e s and the allowable l i m i t s of t h e i r nonuniformi t i e s in a region are not same in a l l cases. suppose a human being sees a newspaper. if he has no i n t e r e s t in reading i t   he may r e gard it as a sheet of paper having almost same t e x t u r e . of course he can recognize each character or d i s c r i m i n a t e d i f f e r e n c e between each atomic region of the t e x t u r e   when his i n t e r e s t in reading is deep enough to decrease the t h r e s h o l d value f o r d i s c r i m i n a t i n g r e g i o n s . 
1 　　　in t h i s paper  a method is proposed f o r f i n d i n g regions in the complex scenes whi ch c o n t a i n many objects and backgrounds on which d i f f e r e n t t e x t u r e s or p a t t e r n s are observed. a simple example is shown in f i g . l 

which includes a cube and a plane covered by two different patterns. we intend to describe 
more complex scenes having much information in terms of regions in which some picture properties are regarded as uniform. statistical methods for finding the abrupt changes in the average gray levels seem to be inadequate for our purpose  because these approaches are not useful to distinguish differences between patterns of complex structures. thus a structural analysis on homogeneities of several picture properties such as shapes or sizes of atomic regions in the input picture  as well as their relations  is used to find the regions. 
picture properties 
     before descibing the procedures for examining the uniformity in the region  we must clarify what picture properties are used for the analysis. in this paper  the atomic region is defined as a connected set of picture elements having almost same gray level or color. a preprocessor of the system finds these atomic regions in the digitized picture from a tv camera  and sends to the homogeneity analyzer the information of these atomic regions characterized by their average gray levels and colors  as well as their boundaries written in chain coding. there are many atomic regions in an input picture  therefore an efficient representation of their characteristics is needed in order to save memory space and computing time. several picture descriptors of the atomic region are selected. they are shape  size  position  color and average gray level descriptors  although last two are not used in the partitioning process. area and perimeter of each atomic region are specified 
by the size descriptor  and the position descriptor gives the two dimensional cordinate at the center of gravity of the atomic region. 
     because of the limitaion in the resolution of the tv camera  accurate shape of the atomic region is not available  and the shape descriptor must be selected in such a way that it gives coarse information of the shape and it is not sensitive to sampling noises in the process of digitizing picture. a set of i j t h order moment m. . seems to sattisfy these conditions. a combination of 
m	 	m	 	m	 	m	 	m
1	a '	1l*	1 	and	1 is adopted as the 
shape descriptor  since a series of experiments shows that it is adequate for detecting shape differences of small size domains. 
     another type of picture properties used for the analysis is relation between two atomic regions or regions. for simplicity  only the density descriptors are used for representing the relation between atomic regions in a group. let define the distance between two atomic regions as the distance between their centers of gravity. an atomic region a in a given set s has a density descriptor d whose value is the minimum distance frorn1 a to other atomic regions in s. 
regions 
     examining the similarities of the picture properties by comparing the values of these descriptors  the system will classify the atomic regions into sets s1  s1 ...  sn 

which are candidates for the regions. the region r covered by m elements in the set s is defined as follows. let denote the maximum value of the density descriptors in s by ls . ft is a connected area covered by squares whose length of edge is ls and centers are located at centers of gravity of all members of s   fig.1  . sometimes there are plural regions whose elements belong to one set s. 
     the analyzer also examines a relation between regions. fig.1 shows a simple example in which there exist two classes of atomic regions. let r1  and r1 be regions covered by small dots and large dots.respectively.  since common area of fljf  /  of two regions has considerable size  it seems reasonable for the analyzer to regard these areas as 
＊three regions r1   * 1   r} o ffg and r1 o r1 instead of two. 
     therefore the system checks whether each region has any overlapped part or not  but neglect ones whose size is less than a certain threshold value. 
structural analysis 
structural analysis 
     fig.1 shows an overall diagram of the scene analyzer. output of a standard vidicon camera is transmitted to an analog to digital converter which produces one of 1  1 or 1 digitized pictures with 1 gray levels. a preprocessor searches in the digitized picture for the atomic regions. we consider that color information is more useful to our purpose  
however only gray level information is used in the experiments. in this paper  an as-
1 sumption is made that each atomic region has a clear outline. thus we put l i t t l e emphasis on the process of finding the atomic 
fig.1 overall diagram of the scene analyzer 
regions  and usual procedures are used for detecting the contours of the connected areas in which gray level of each point is lower than the threhold value decided by the gray level histogram. 1 fig.1 shows the result for the input scene of f i g . l which is digitized in a 1 array. 
     a l i s t of these atomic regions with their boundaries described in chain coding is sent to the homogeneity analyzer. the analyzer divides the same input scene in different ways depending on the depth of interest in particular picture property. since we intend to apply the descriptions of the scene in terms of regions to automatic recognition or identification of objects  successive p a r t i tion must be made in heuristic ways to find an interpretable goal p a r t i t i o n whose structure matches one of combined models of the objects. therefore the system is provided for a supervisor which receive the information from the analyzer  and then plans the sequence of partitioning which is sent back to 
the analyzer. 
homogeneity test 
     a detailed block diagram of the homogeenity analyzer is shown in fig.1. first of a l l   the picture descriptors are evaluated and their l i s t is constructed. secondly  histograms of values of the descriptors are computed and small fluctuations in them are suppressed by a f i l t e r which smoothes the fig.1 detected atomic regions in 1 digitized picture of f i g . l . 
small peaks standing close to each other. these frequency distributions are examined by the supervisor to select the most promising descriptor for classifying the atomic regions into groups. we consider that a descriptor is promising to i n i t i a l p a r t i t i o n ing if the atomic regions are definitely classified into a few groups by i t . choosing the descriptors whose histograms have deep valleys between prominent peaks  the supervisor sets thresholds at the bottoms of the valleys. since v a l i d i t y of classifying the members in the valleys by thresholding is ambiguous  the descriptor having the 
minimum number of such members is selected by the supervisor. fig.1 shows the histograms of the descriptors of the input scene of f i g . l   and the perimeter term of the size descriptor is selected for the f i r s t stage p a r t i t i o n i n g . 
     next the density descriptors of members in each group are evaluated. if some mem-
bers have the density descriptors whose values are larger than a predetermined threshold value  they are regarded as isolated atomic regions and are excluded from the groups. 	thus the f i r s t stage partitioning has groups s1 s1 ..............sn as candidates for regions. 	as mentioned in the previous section  the areas covered by these groups are decided  and then their connectivity and overlapping are examined to decide re-

gions. if a connected area of region candidates has less than five members  the analyzer does not regard it as a region and re-
gisters its members in a group of isolated atomic regions. 	next  a boundary test is 
done to check whether any atomic regions in the group of isolated elements are located 
between two regions ot surrounded by a region. they are joined to the region if only one region touches them. however they are l e f t in the isolated member's group if two regions touch them  because we cannot find any simple methods for finding which 
region is more adequate for merging them. fig.1 shows the results for cassifying into regions by the size descriptors. the regions r1 and r1 correspond to the cube and the plane  respectively. small size atomic 
regions at the boundary of the picture are 
not classified into region candidates of r 1 but the boundary test joins them to r1. 
     the regions described by their boundaries and elements are sent to the supervisor which f i t t s straight lines to the boundaries to 
	get a line drawing. 	if any part of the line 
drawing does not match the structure of the models  the supervisor considers the result of the p a r t i t i o n is not successful and further partitioning is done. there are three 
methods to change the p a r t i t i o n : 1  deeper p a r t i t i o n i n g   1} modified partitioning after 
changing threshold values  1  new p a r t i t i o n ing by another descriptor. in our experi-
ments only deeper partioning is programmed  then the iterative partitionings are termi-
nated when any matched part of the regions 
to the model structures is found or no further partitioning is possible. satisfactory results are obtained for simple input scenes  
however other type modifications are necessa-
ry for complex inputs. 
     regions r1 r 1  ... found by the f i r s t stage partitioning are processed independently to obtain deeper p a r t i t i o n r 1 r 1 
r1 r1 ..............the procedures are same as those of the f i r s t stage. fig.1 shows the

finer difference between members having a almost same feature  if the previous p a r t i tion is adequate. the results of p a r t i t i o n ing r1 into three regions r1  r1  r1 
which correspond to three planes of the cube  are shown in fig. 1. 	two small triangles 
fig.1 partitioned results by size descriptor 	and a square at the boundary of r1 in fig.1 
are classified into the isolated member's 
group and eliminated from the regions. the histograms of descriptors in r- have no deep valleys.  and further partitioning is not
