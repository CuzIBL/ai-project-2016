 
　　tale-spin  the laat major ai attempt at atory generation  approached the problem of making up atoriea primarily from the perspective of an impartial world simulator. author ia a program  under development  which generates atoriea as a creative reaaoner in purauit of her own narrative goals. it is thus intended to aimulate an author's mind aa ahe makes up a story  rather than the world as things happen in i t . the four major forces driving the atory generation process  according to the author model  are 
 1  author 	i n t e n t i o n a l i t y   
 1  conceptual reformulation  
 1  reminding  and 
 1  the opportunity enhancement metagoal. 
1. world simulation based story generation 
　　tale-spin  meehan  1  is a program which made up aesop-fable-like conceptual atoriea  which it then expressed in natural language. each atory tale-spin made up waa based on a model of the storyworld  including the characters in it and their goala  peraonalities  and interperaonal relatione. storiea were apun by working out consequences of the model. thus  central to tale-spin waa the idea of world simulation. 
　　the three levels tale-spin was most concerned with simulating were: 
1. character i n t e n t i o n a l i t y - e . g .   if joe bear was hungry  he would t r y to get something to eat 
1. social conatrainta - e . g .   if joe bear believed irving bird to be hia f r i e n d   he could aak an outright favor; if joe bear believed their r e l a t i o n to be a bit cooler  he would feel obliged to offer something in return  auch aa a worm  
1. phyaical cauaality - e . g .   if irving bird ate a worm  the worm would cease to e x i s t ; after  fooling around   
   aa oppoaed to sheldon klein's ayetem which only produced atory texts and which ia incapable  in p r i n c i p l e   of understanding the atoriea it  makes up   klein et e l .   1 . 
characters f e l t  wiped out  
   world simulation  however  f a i l s to r e f l e c t the proctaa that an author goes through in making up a atory - storyworlds are developed by authors aa needed  frequently as post hoc j u s t i f i c a t i o n for eventa that the author has already decided ahe 
wants as part of the story. as i l l u s t r a t i o n   let us consider the question of why  in the star wars aequel   the empire strikes back   princess leia and solo go to v i s i t landeau. 
　　if one asks a reader  or viewer  this question  the anawer w i l l be along the lines of   they needed a place to hide from imperial stormtroopers u n t i l they got the hyperdrive f i x e d   and landeau was an 
old buddy of solo's  and . . .     
　　were this story being made up by a world simulation approach  landeau would have to have been invented as part of the i n i t i a l specification of the story world  back before any of the atory action had been decided. the deciaions that solo liked landeau a lot and trusted him some but that landeau was dishonest  would also have to have been made before starting the action. landeau would then have remained dormant u n t i l it developed that leia and solo ran into hyperdrive problems while fleeing imperial stormtroopers. at this point  storyworld causal necceaaity would have to require solo to do some further planning and thence think of asking landeau for help. 
   setting up an i n i t i a l story world such that things work out in an interesting way i s   at the 
very least  t r i c k y business. 
1. author intent based story generation 
   a more plausible mechaniam for making up t h i s story  however  is one driven by author intent  in 
which landeau would not be invented u n t i l needed. his invention would be motivated by the need to get solo out of action for a while so that luke 
skywalker could get the g i r l   get the credit for some heroic behavior  and eventually rescue solo and repay his debt. 
　　the difference between a world simulation and an author-intentional model of the story generation proceaa hingea on the difference between character and author goala. while a character's purpose   l i k e a real person's  is to have things go well for himself and for those he carea about  the author's purpoae ia to make up a good atory. the author can think about the atory world  but ia not 
1 

part of i t ; she cannot be personally threatened by dangers in the story world  nor can she take advantage of opportunities that arise there. though the author w i l l frequently  intervene  to ensure that things work out well for a character or to ensure that he loses  she is never in the relation of goal cooperation or goal competition  as described in  wilensky  1   with the character  because she is functioning on a different level than the character whose fate she determines. to the author  the character is mere modelling clay l i k e the rest of the story world which serves as his environment. 
   the claim  then  is that making up a story is a deeply goal-based a c t i v i t y   the f i n a l story standing as the achievement of a complex web of author goals. the author's goals serve as a sort of scaffolding in constructing the story; they are no longer d i r e c t l y v i s i b l e in the f i n a l story  but are reflected in the storyworld situations and resolutions they gave rise t o . 
1. conceptual reformulation 
   author goals do not remain static as story generation progresses. in f a c t   a large part of the work of making up a story is the successive reformulation of author goals. story ideas  fragments  etc. also go through numerous conceptual d r a f t s   each reformulation supplying new perspectives which aid further r e t r i e v a l of related 
material and constraints from the author's memory. 
　　conceptual reformulation is an a c t i v i t y that happens on many different levels in the story generation process - e . g .   getting the author from an idea to a kernel episode  from a kernal episode to a sequence of episodes  from an characterization of someone to an episode i l l u s t r a t i n g that characterization  from a change in relation between two characters to a dialogue triggering or reflecting that change. 
   suppose  for instance  the author has developed the following kernal episode: 
　　shy person  protagonist  in need of employment gets job as salesman but is incapable of facing $door-to-door. failure seems imminent when protagonist comes up with  and t r i e s   sform-letter as substitute script towards same goal. succeeds with f l y i n g colors 
   after several passes of successive reformulation  the story sketch might now be: 
ep1: anecdote demonstrating shyness of protagonist 
ep1: episode demonstrating closeness of protagonist to mother  further development of protagonist's shyness; drama enhancer for ep1  
ep1: episode revealing continuing unemployment of protagonist  and his interview avoidance   
ep1: protagonist's mother f a l l s seriously  and expensively  i l l ; urgency of employment increases 
ep1: starts responding by mail to newspaper want ads  foreshadowing of f i n a l solution  
1 
ep1: series of job application f a i l u r e s   leading to decreasing discrimination in selection of ads to respond to 
ep1: success    - opportunity as commissioned door-to-door salesman 
ep1: details of conditions  through l e t t e r   : should show up at o f f i c e for one day of orientation  starting on road the next  commission system with minimum monthly quota 
ep1: f i r s t day at work: obnoxious 	friendliness 	of salesmen 
ep1: $door-to-door script presented  in story round among saleamen  in exceedingly 
	unfavorable 	l i g h t 
ep1: at home after f i r a t day at work; in shock over encounter; in further shock at thought of coming month 
ep1: more bad news about mother's health  increasing drama 
ep1: agonizing by protagonist about about mess he's i n   and recapitulation of i t   leads to idea of $form-letter 
ep1: writing and sending out l e t t e r s   applying old mass mailing system  from ep1  
ep1: f i r s t 	mixed 	results 	coming 	i n ; 	pessimistic interpretation 
ep1: orders pouring i n ; rave success 
ep1: epilogue: appreciation and money pouring in from company 
   there is insufficient space to l i s t a l l the reformulations made  but the following handful can serve as i l l u s t r a t i o n . the author goal to 
1. make 	the 	story 	plausible 	got reformulated into the author goal to 
a. j u s t i f y the protagonist getting into such an unlikely situation for a shy person 
b. j u s t i f y the protagonist coming up with the solution he did 
1. make the story dramatic got reformulated into the author goal to 
a. emphasize the aversiveness of the salesman situation 
b. reduce the obviousness of the letter campaign solution 
i l l u s t r a t e 	key 	facts 	got 	reformulated into the author goal to make up episodes i l l u s t r a t i n g and presenting 
a. the protagonist's shyness 
b. the protagonist's mother's illness 
bach of these reformulations  of course  w i l l undergo numerous further ones as the story develops further. 
1. author memory and story generation 
　　aa tale-1pim was basically simulating the world  rather than an author'a mind   memory issues  were restricted to matters of computer data structures and repreaentation of knowledge* author  however  reliea very heavily on a memory that is human-like in i t a organisation and contents. this memory needs to contain not only facta about the atoryworld thua far conatructed  but also prior knowledge of memorable epiaodea  characters  etc. in the author's l i f e . how a l l thia ia organised and acceaaed ia very c r i t i c a l to the story generation process. of specie 1 importance are memory search strategiea  kolodner  1  and reminding mechanisms  schank  in press . a  by-product  of conceptual reformulation  actually  thia may be why it ia so effective in the f i r s t place  ia greater opportunity for relevant remindings. 
　　reminding plays two important roles in the story generation process: 
1. aa a source of relevant external material - incidenta  characters  etc. from the author's l i f e - to be worked into the story  and 
1. as a way of keeping track of internal material  narrative goals  etc. allowing the author to become distracted  another important memory phenomenon  yet return to earlier ideas as they become relevant again. 
1. creative reasoning 
　　story generation ia predominantly a process of creative reasoning. aa auch  there are two eaaential characteristics of the process that any model of story generation ahould capture: the degree to which the proceaa ia deliberate and directed  and the degree to which the process is serendipitous. 
   although story generation is driven by the author's narrative goals  story generation ia not planful in the t r a d i t i o n a l   top-down  means-end analysis sense. rather  there are two metagosls: 
1. that of achieving the current narrative goal  and 
1. that of finding better narrative goals to pursue. 
	methan 	waa 	very 	concerned 	with 	r e s t r i c t i n g 
tale-spin's knowledge to the kinds of knowledge people have; thus  for inetance  he uaed a symbolic  rather than a more e f f i c i e n t numerical  repreaentation for storyworld geography. nonetheleaa  it was s u f f i c i e n t   for his purposes  to index  facts  in a very simplistic manner. 
the suthor  or sny creative thinker  has to be able 
to pursue the former  while recognising that it the l a t t e r that is sctually the more important. is    there are aeveral eaaential characteristics creative reasoning: of 1. s e n s i t i v i t y to unforeseen opportunities  when one hss the good fortune for them to srise 
1. willingness to be distracted from what one was doing  if something better cones up 
1. s process of successive reformulation  dramatically increaaing the probability that uaeful opportunities w i l l ariae 
1. having at a l l times a aenae of direction which aervea both 
a. to keep the author usefully occupied in progressing towarda her goals 
b. to provide new environments in which fortuitous opportunities sre 
l i k e l y to s r i s e . 
this last characteriatic  the opportunity enhancement metagoal  accounts for the dual directed-yet-serendipidous nature of creative thinking: why conceptual reformulation is so powerful a mechaniam  and how a phenomenon auch as being reminded can be constructively chsnneled in the crestive thought process comprising story generstion.
