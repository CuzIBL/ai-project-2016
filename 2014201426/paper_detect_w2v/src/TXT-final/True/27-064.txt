 
in this paper we consider constrained and rational default logics we provide two characterizations of constrained extensions one of them is used to derive complexity results for decision problems involving constrained extensions in particular  we show that the problem of membership of a formula in at least one  in all  constrained extension s  of a default theory is ef-complete  ilf-complete  we establish the relationship between constrained and rational default logics we prove that rational ex tensions determine constrained extensions and that for seminormal default theories there is a one-to-one correspondence between these objects we also show that the definition of a constrained extension can be extended to cover the case of default theories which may contain 
justification-free defaults 
1 	introduction 
default logic  introduced by reiter   is one of the most extensively studied nonmonotonic systems several recent research monographs offer a comprehensive presentation of theoretical and practical aspects of de fault logic  besnard  1  brewka  1b  marek and truszczynski  1  default logic was designed to handle reasoning from incomplete information it allows us to draw conclusions on the basis of  the lack of evidence to the contrary  this formalism assigns to a default theory a collection of theories called extensions they describe possible belief sets of an agent reasoning with this theory 
　all its desirable properties notwithstanding  there are situations where default logic of reiter produces countenntuitive results in particular  this logic docs not handle well incomplete information given in the form of disjunctive clauses  poole  1  brewka  1a  gelfond et al  1  mikitiuk and truszczynski  1  
to remedy this  several modifications of default logic were proposed disjunctive default logic  gelfond et al  1   cumulative default logic  brewka 1a   constrained default logic  schaub  1  and rational default logic  mikitiuk and truszczynski  1  the first system introduces a new disjunction operator to handle  effective  disjunction the latter three take into account  in one way or another  the requirement that defaults with mutually inconsistent justifications must not be used in 
the construction of the same extension not surprising } then  they are somewhat related 
　connections between cumulative default logic and constrained default logic are studied in  schaub  1  it is shown there that these two systems are  in a certain sense equivalent at the same time  they are quite differ ent from default logic of reiter both commit to assumptions and have such properties as semi-monotonicity and orthogonality1 in addition in each of these two logics every default theory has an extension in the logic of reiter all these properties hold for normal default theories but fail m the general case  in fact  for normal default theories  reiter's default logic is essentially equivalent to constrained and cumulative default logics  
　in this paper  we investigate connections between ra tional and constrained  and  consequently  also cumulative  default logics rational default logic similarly as the logic of reiter  lacks many of the properties of constrained default logic in particular  default theories may have no ritional extensions and rational default logic does not have the properties of semi monotomcitv and orthogonality the reason is that rational default logic  unhke constrained default logic does not commit to assumptions  t the same time connections between rational and const ained default logics are quite strong we show thrt every rational extension of a default theory determines a constrained extension moreover we show that rational and constrained default logics coincide for the class of seminormal default theories - a much wider class of theories than normal ones  for which all four versions of default logic mentioned here are equivalent 
	we also give a useful  proof-theoretic 	characteriza-
schaub  uses the term weak orthogonality 
	mikitiuk and truszczynski 	1 
tion of the operator   which was used in  schaub  1  to define the notion of a constrained extension conse quently  we get an equivalent definition of constrained extensions this result allows us to design an algorithm for computing constrained extensions and to establish the complexity of reasoning with constrained extensions since every default theory has a constrained extension  the problem of existence of a constrained extension is  clearly  in p we show that the problem to decide  given a formula   whether is in at least one constrained extension  in all constrained extensions  of a given de fault theory  is -complete  n -complete  in view of a recent result on the complexity of cumulative default logic  gottlob and mingyi  1  and our results on the complexity of ration al default logic  mikitiuk and truszczynski  1   it follows that all these modes of reasoning have the same computational complexity 
   finally  let us note that schaub did not allow justification-free defaults in his definition of constrained default log/c in this paper  we show how to extend ron strained default logic to raver theories which may contain justification-free defaults

a default is any expression of the form 
 1  
whert are prepositional formulas let d be a default of the form  1  the formula a is called the prerequisite of d  p d  in symbols the formulas  are called the justifications of d 
the set of justifications is denoted by j d  finally  the formula  is called the consequent of d and is denoted c d  for a collection d of defaults by p{d   j d  and c{d  we denote  respectively  the sets of all prerequi sites  justifications and consequents of the defaults in d 
a default of the form  resp   is called normal  seminormal  resp   
　a default theory is a pair  d w    where d is a set of defaults and w ib a set of propositional formulas a default theory  d w  is nonnal  semtnormal  resp   if all defaults in d are normal  sermnormal  resp   a default theor   d  w   is finite if both d and w are finite 
for a set d of defaults we define 
　given a set of ml  ence rules a  b   we mean the consequence operator of the formal proof s stem pc+ar consisting of propositional calculus and the rules in a 
　in  mikutiuk and truszczjnskj  1  we introduced the notions of an active set of defaults and a rational extension of a default theory

1 	conclusions 
in this paper we showed that constrained and rational default logic* are closely related while reiter s default logic and constrained default logic coincide on the class of normal default theories  rational and constrained default logics coincide on a much wider class of seminonnal default theories 
　we showed that basic problems of reasoning with constrained extensions are complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy  with the exception of the existence of an extension problem  which is trivially in p  we also proposed algorithms to compute constrained extensions 
   constrained default logic was originally introduced onlj for default theories without justification-free de faults in the paper  we proposed a modification of the original definition of schaub  which allows for defaultb to be justification-free under our definition  all major properties of constrained default logic remain true
