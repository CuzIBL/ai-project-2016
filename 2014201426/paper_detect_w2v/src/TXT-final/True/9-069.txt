 
       experimental techniques are demonstrated which generate segmented symbolic descriptions for complex objects with joints  such as a hammer or a glove. complete  descriptions with relationship of parts at joints and descriptions of joints are presented. these techniques are elements of a larger scheme for description mechanisms for hypotheses  and for visual memory 
and recognition.

1. 	introduction 
       we describe experiments with symbolic description of curved objects. tn previous work1 descriptions 
were generated for the pieces of objects  according to a volume representation of shape1. the pieces are an adequate description only of objecls with a single part  like a torus or a snake. we have generalized and 
improved techniques for descriptions of pieces. we have made complete descriptions which join the scattered pieces into a whole. these descriptions are the basis for recognition  and a few examples are discussed. 
       the motivations for studying representation of shape are: 	for visual systems of robots which use 
depth or image data; for the interactive programming of assembly robots for industrial tasks; for the computerization of industry-machining  parts description  systemstization of assembly operations; for display; and for its relevance to other areas of a.j. and biology. our concern is implementation of symbolic descriptions oi shape and space which are adequate for integrated robot systems. we do not think a single 
representation is adequate throughout a system  but we 
have attempted to analyze tasks in terms of computational primitives originating from topological and geometrical primitives  and design representation 
abilities accordingly. representative- tasks are manipulation  display  and recognition. manipulation requires mass and momenta of articulated parts  and ability to calculate overall moments in various positions and orientations. display requires description of surface properties and two dimensional proximity  to find overlapping surfaces tn the image. recognition requires visual memory for generation of hypotheses  prediction and verification facilities  geometric relations among parts  and a good choice of parts. 
1. 	representation and models 
       the representations-' depend upon segmentation of complex objects into parts. parts can themselves be

composed of subparts. the value of the part/whole segmentation depends on a useful representation for primitive parts. the basic topological operations of cutting and pasting are used in joining parts. the representation oi parts and joints amounts to the basis tor an intelligent guess about structure. special knowledge about joints  e.g. the anatomy of humans  is much more powerful. 
　　　primitive parts arc described by volume representations. the primitive parts are arm-like pieces which 
are described as  generalized local cones  by localizing and generalizing translational invarianco--. these local coties are the volumes swept out by translating an arbitrary cross section  maintaining it normal to 
the path along which it is translated  while the scale of the cross section is changed smoothly. more generally  we have locally snake-like and locally screwlike shapes. the basis of this representation is transformation ot local descriptions. the typical element is a snake-like piece described by an axis fwhich is a space curve  and arbitrary normal cross-
section valued functions . 
　　　we have chosen a high level representation to interface with heuristics rather than a low-level representation  which is directly calculable jrom data  such as the fourier transform. we feel that heuristics should be at as high a level as possible and wish to provide a language for their expression. 
　　　a representation must have computational equivalents. in the following  we demonstrate computational equivalents for the t reatment of generalized cross-section 
and axis determination. 
1' . data acquisition and description of hardware 
　　　we derive three-dimensional information about an object  by a laser triangulation ranging system. the details of the operation  construction and calibration of this apparatus are tully described by agin1  who built this system. we will include only those details necessary for our discussion here. 
　　　a sequence of parallel planes of light generated by a laser beam are cast on the scene viewed by a tv camera. an interference filter allows the camera to see only the laser light. each tv frame shows a space curve corresponding to one plane of light. depth discontinuities in space appear as discontinuities in image. a second sequence of scans orthogonal to the first is useful because the first sequence gives only 
crude information about boundaries parallel to the planes. the initial data consists of two intersecting sets of curves tn the tv image  fig. 1 . any point among these curves can be mapped to 1-d coorindar.es. 
boundary organization 
　　　a boundary for the object can be defined by joining the end points of the segments from the two sets 
of scans in a c e r t a i n coherent fashion. 	there are 
several reasons 	for constructing t h i s boundary. 	it 
helps l i n k the two sets of scans  and provides an ordering on the segments that is useful in axis f i n d i n g . it provides a sense of neighborhood that prevents the routines which extend pieces from crossing boundaries as discussed in a l a t e r s e c t i o n . knowledge of the boundary helps in keeping track of the areas already 
described by associating them w i t h corresponding parts of the boundary. there is also considerable psychologi c a l evidence to indicate that humans make extensive use of boundaries in their perception of visual scenes. 
     to construct the boundary  we need to order the end points of the segments l i n e a r l y . ordering the points by a nearest neighbor approach does not y i e l d the r i g h t boundaries. 
     the boundary should not cross a s o l i d part of the body  i . e . through any scan segments. consider successive scan segments s1 and s1  see f i g . 1 . where there 
is a cross scan segment on which interesects both s1 and s1  the two segments are connected. the boundary cannot cross the cross segment cn and must turn hack. the boundary extends from one end of s1 through e i t h e r the f i r s t cross scan c1  if it terminates between s1 
and s1  or to the end of 	s1. 	the process is continued 
in the same fashion. 	we obtain one or more closed 
boundaries o u t l i n i n g the object. the boundaries obtained for some objects are shown in figs. 1 and 1. 
     boundary l i n k i n g requires c a l c u l a t i n g the i n t e r sections of segments from the two crossed scans. we need calculate only a few of the possible intersections near the ends of segments. given a segment s1  we can calculate which cross scan angles contain segments 
which intersect s1  by c a l c u l a t i n g the angles of endpoints of s1 from the laser viewpoint  and obtaining cross scans in that range of angles . the i n t e r section of two segments is determined by making piece-
wise l i n e a r approximations to the two segments. a few minor errors and extra e f f o r t are caused by s l i g h t 
e r r o r s in the i n t e r s e c t i o n process and by c a l i b r a t i o n u n c e r t a i n t i e s which give small angle errors in choosing cross scans. 
     an a l t e r n a t i v e approach would be to use a large a r r a y   where each byte of the array corresponds to a p o s i t i o n in the image plane. for each point that belongs to some segment in one scan o r i e n t a t i o n mark the corresponding byte in the array by this segment number. 
     now  for each point that belongs to some segment  1   in the cross scan check whether the corresponding byte in the memory is marked. if so  then the segment s   intersects w i t h the marked segment in the memory at t h i s p o i n t . this method w i l l give us a l l i n t e r sections without searching. the obvious disadvantage is the requirement of a large memory. the time r e q u i r ed w i l l be p r o p o r t i o n a l to the boundary length. 
i1 . 	description of p r i m i t i v e s . axis determination 
     we wish to describe a complex object in terms of components which are simple to describe  and the r e l a t i o n s h i p s of these p a r t s . we thus need to segment a given object i n t o simpler p a r t s . we describe p r i m i t i v e s by an a x i s   which is an a r b i t r a r y space curve  and normal cross-sections along t h i s a x i s . our basic c r i t e r i a for accepting a piece as simple are that the d i r e c t i o n of the axis be continuous and that the cross-section function along the axis be continuous. we look for portions w i t h large changes in the crosss e c t i o n   and consider them as l i k e l y places for segmenting the o b j e c t . the segmentation process must 
be f l e x i b l e and able to generate a l t e r n a t e p r o p o s i t i o n s . a higher l e v e l routine could sometimes guide this process. 
preliminary 	segmentation 
     we derive a preliminary segmentation  based on the descriptions of scan segments. we look for a group of segments  that are adjacent and have continuously varying lengths. adjacency is determined by their proximity in the boundary l i s t . we use the length of a segment  to check for the c o n t i n u i t y of cross-sections. however other measures  such as moments of the curves describing the segments  could be used as descriptors of the crosss e c t i o n s . a number of segments so linked together is called a  group . note  that a given part of the object may be included in more than one group  corresponding to d i f f e r e n t d i r e c t i o n s of the scans. the groups are 
generated for the two sets of segments obtained e a r l i e r . however  some parts of the o b j e c t   are perhaps not w e l l described in these d i r e c t i o n s . we generate synthetic segments in other d i r e c t i o n s   by computing intersections of l i n e s of a c e r t a i n o r i e n t a t i o n w i t h the boundary. these new segments are grouped in a s i m i l a r fashion. preliminary segmentation is i n t i m a t e l y connected w i t h d e s c r i p t i o n of pieces and should be guided from higher levels . 
     the i n i t i a l groups are trea ted only as s t a r t i n g places. in the process of d e s c r i p t i o n   we may extend a group or break up a group. a l s o   groups may be suggested a f t e r we have removed some parts that have been described w e l l . 
piece 	description 
     the piece we wish to describe is given by a group of segments  and the corresponding boundary. we wish to find an a x i s   cross-section d e s c r i p t i o n for t h i s piece. the constraints for the d e s c r i p t i o n are the f o l l o w i n g : 
     1 . the cross-sections must be normal to the local axis . 
     1. the axis must pass through corresponding points of the cross-sections. in the 1-d v e r s i o n   the corresponding points are taken to be mid-way between the end points on the boundary. 
     an i n i t i a l guess is obtained by taking the midpoints of the segments in the preliminary group. we then construct cross-sections normal to the axis at these points and compute t h e i r intersections with the boundary. a new axis is defined by the mid-points of these i n t e r s e c t i o n s . if the distance of the new axis 
points from the old axis points is not s u f f i c i e n t l y s m a l l   we i t e r a t e this process u n t i l it converges. cross-sections may be in e i t h e r 1-d or 1-d coordinates. 
     this process usually converges f o r pieces that are part of w e l l defined c y l i n d e r s . parts of the object where convergence f a i l s must be described by an a l t e r nate group or a f t e r i n t e r f e r i n g pieces have been explained and removed. 
     an a l t e r n a t i v e to i t e r a t i o n is to f i n d a best cone that f i t s the given boundary segments. 	the cone is a generalized cone  with a r b i t r a r y axis and crosss e c t i o n f u n c t i o n . 	when looking at a small part of the piece  we constrain the axis to be a s t r a i g h t l i n e or a parabola. 	the cross-section function is l i m i t e d to be l i n e a r . 	a best f i t in the least squares sense  is found w i t h these c o n s t r a i n t s   g i v i n g us the axis and 
be found without i t e r a t i o n . 	generalized 	cross-sections cross-sections d i r e c t l y . the s o l u t i o n is p a r t i c u l a r l y simple for the case of a s t r a i g h t l i n e a x i s   and may extensions of a piece 
     once an a x i s   cross-section description of a part is found  we see whether t h i s description extends in a continuous manner over a larger part of the body. we extrapolate the axis at e i t h e r end by a small distance. a normal cross-section to the axis is constructed at t h i s p o i n t and i t s i n t e r s e c t i o n s with the boundary are 
computed  a test is made to see whether this crosssection s a t i s f i e s the constraints noted above  by computing i t s mid-point and comparing the distance of the mid-point from the extrapolated a x i s . if the 
distance is s u f f i c i e n t l y s m a l l   we accept the new crosssection and take i t s mid-point as the new point along the axis- and attempt to extend f u r t h e r . if not  then we make a modified guess at the extrapolated a x i s   by including the newly found p o i n t . we recompute the normal cross-section and repeat the above t e s t . this 
allows us to trace the a x i s for a smoothly curving o b j e c t . we have not found it necessary to i t e r a t e in t h i s phase of extension. the c r i t e r i a for terminating the extension process are: 
     1. when no i n t e r s e c t i o n can be found w i t h the neighboring boundary. this usually occurs because of 
a sharp change in the slope of the boundary  and agrees w i t h our i n t u i t i v e sense of a proper segmentati o n p o i n t   or at the end of an o b j e c t . 
     1. it the length  radius  of the new cross-section is very d i f f e r e n t from the lengths of previous crosssections . 
     when the extension process terminates  a check is made to see if a termination for the piece has been reached. we check whether the unexplained piece of boundary between the two segments on the sides of the piece is l a r g e l y contained in a small extension of the piece near the terminating end. in 1-d processing  normal terminations would be detected in a very natural 
way. special tests can be made to check for spherical or oblique terminations. for examples of piece descriptions see figs. 1. 1 and 1. 
     summary descriptors for the piece such as the length of i t s a x i s   the r a t i o of t h i s length to the average width of the cross-sections  and curve f i t descriptions of the axis d i r e c t i o n and cross-section function are determined. these include descriptors such as s t r a i g h t or parabolic for the axis and constant  l i n e a r e t c   for the cross-section f u n c t i o n . 
     this method of d e r i v i n g piece descriptions is s i m i l a r to that described by agin. the important differences are in our use of the boundary for finding new cross-sections  r e q u i r i n g s i g n i f i c a n t l y less 
computation than his scheme  which involves computing i n t e r s e c t i o n s w i t h many segments. also  the process 
of extension is more s t r u c t u r e d   as it follows the boundary  and spurious extensions in d i s t a n t parts of the bodies are not made. agin's procedures d i d not use the boundary  and when attempting to extend would 
sometimes make extensions crossing the boundary  e . g . some extensions would extend across two fingers in a glove. we are able to test for terminations. also 
we make no assumptions about the shape of the crosssections  agin assumes c i r c u l a r c r o s s - s e c t i o n s   . 
     extensions are found for a l l groups found by i n i t i a l segmentation. thus many parte of the body w i l l be included in more than one d e s c r i p t i o n . this is not a disadvantage  but a c r u c i a l advantage; it allows us to compare a l t e r n a t i v e s and choose on the basis of some g l o b a l context. 
     we have not made use of the shape of the crosssections. we see only a small part of them. we have l i t t l e information on the cross-sections  p a r t i c u l a r l y for small objects  due to ranging e r r o r s . this makes their d e t a i l e d description d i f f i c u l t . however  we can 
make crude judgements  e . g . that the palm of a glove is not c i r c u l a r . the c o n t i n u i t y of the pieces can be 
checked by applying t r a n s l a t i o n a l invariance c r i t e r i o n to these cross-sections  e i t h e r d i r e c t l y on a p o i n t by 
point basis or by comparing t h e i r d e s c r i p t o r s . these descriptors may be some moments of the cross-section 1 or expansions in an orthogonal s e r i e s . we can use the c o n t i n u i t y of cross-sections in preliminary segmentation as w e l l as v e r i f i c a t i o n of piece extensions. 
     other i n t e r e s t i n g descriptions are the d i r e c t i o n s of minimum and maximum curvature. minimum curvature d i r e c t i o n is the d i r e c t i o n of axis for a c i r c u l a r 
snake. 	however  they have no d i r e c t r e l a t i o n to the 
axes d i r e c t i o n s for many shapes. also  these d i r e c t i o n s are sensitive to noise in the data and hence i l l - d e f i n e d . 
1. 	linking of pieces 
     local description of pieces generates redundant piece d e s c r i p t i o n s . consider  for example  a rectangle. we may generate one d e s c r i p t i o n of an axis along the length  w i t h terminations at both ends. we may also 
generate other descriptions near the corners  describing the piece as part of a cone. 
     each overlapping pair of pieces is compared. parts of piecel that are not covered by piece;-' are computed. the areas of these parts and the distances of t h e i r constituent points from the common edge are computed. if the area of the uncovered part is r e l a t i v e l y small compared to the area of the piece i n v o l v e d   and a l l points are close to the common boundary  then piecel is assumed to be t o t a l l y contained in piece 1. a l l 
pieces that are completely contained in some piece are removed from further consideration. as example: two pieces were found describing the handle of the hammer in f i g . 1. these overlap each other completely and 
only one 	is r e t a i n e d . 
connectivity 	of joints 
     we cut off those parts of the body that have been described by the pieces. we merely follow the boundary and eliminate the segments belonging to any piece. we thus get a boundary for the remaining part of the body of the o b j e c t . the remaining parts may be d i s j o i n t . in this case  we have more than one j o i n t . we w i l l c a l l the remaining parts as j o i n t pieces. with each j o i n t piece  is associated the order o♀ pieces that 
were joined to i t . examples of these are shown in figs. 1   1   and 1. 
other j o i n t descriptors 
we wish to characterize these joints f u r t h e r . when a large j o i n t piece is l e f t   	it may be sent to the a x i s - f i n d i n g routines and perhaps a useful d e s c r i p t -
ion 	obtained 	for 	it. 
     tests are made to examine whether two pieces are c o l l i n e a r   i . e . could they be continuous extensions of each other. this requires that t h e i r respective axes be nearly p a r a l l e l at the near ends  cross-sections be continuous  and they have a small continuous segment of the boundary connecting them. a l t e r n a t i v e l y their respective areas must be close in 1-d. that i s   we check for e i t h e r boundary proximity or distance p r o x i m i t y . it may be noted that distance proximity does not always imply boundary p r o x i m i t y . 
　　　if the j o i n t is largely covered by an extension of the pieces  then we c a l l it a p o i n t - t y p e . such is the case in the example of the hammer. it may be f u r t h e r described by the angle r e l a t i o n s h i p s of i t s members. for the hammer two pieces are nearly c o l l i n e a r and the t h i r d piece is nearly normal to these two. thus it is described as a t - j o i n t . 
     the example of the glove  shows a d i f f e r e n t s t r u c t u r e . the area described by j o i n i n g the ends of the four fingers is very s m a l l . also the amount ot un-
explained boundary between them coriblst of several very short segments. this we describe as a fork. we check for p l a n a r l t y of the area these fingers j o i n t o . we c a l l t h i s a planar fork j o i n t . 
     other descriptions include: the number of limbs at a j o i n t   t h e i r p r o p o r t i o n s   d e t e c t i o n of h o r i z o n t a l 
or v e r t i c a l members  i d e n t i c a l components  designation 
of the dominant pieces by t h e i r s i z e   and axes of b i l a t e r a l symmetry if any. not a l l of these d e s c r i p t ions are made i n i t i a l l y . some are reevaluated in the course of a match. 
1. 
     the descriptions are converted to a symbolic data s t r u c t u r e   using the f a c i l i t i e s of 	leap1. 	leap allows associations and r e t r i e v a l s of the 	form a t t r i b u t e  r  object = v a l u e . 
     we w i l l describe the symbolic s t r u c t u r e derived for the hammer. 

     axisl is a d e s c r i p t o r for a l i s t of a x i s - p o i n t s   tangents to the axis at these points and t h e i r curvef i t d e s c r i p t i o n . xsect1 is a descriptor for a l i s t of 
cross-sections and a c u r v e - f i t d e s c r i p t i o n of the cross-section f u n c t i o n . 
1- 
     recognition consists of matching the symbolic descriptions for the current scene  w i t h some d e s c r i p t ions stored in memory. whether we match against models i n p u t by hand or against previous d e s c r i p t i o n s   the 
problems are the same. we seek a best match such that the current d e s c r i p t i o n is most l i k e l y to be a d e s c r i p t ion of the matched model. we cannot expect to f i n d an exact match of two descriptions since the objects may be viewed from d i f f e r e n t angles  and w i l l have d i f f e r e n t degrees of s e l f - o c c l u s i o n . our d e s c r i p t i v e mechanisms allow a number of a l t e r n a t e d e s c r i p t i o n s to be made for the same scene. we may expect some pieces at some joints to be missing and some extra j o i n t s created. we also allow for a r t i c u l a t i o n of the 
pieces of 	an o b j e c t . 
     the matching problem can be cast in graph-theoretic terms. descriptions may be viewed as graphs with 
pieces and j o i n t s as nodes. the r e l a t i o n s of these pieces and j o i n t s are the arcs of the graph. we also 
have properties associated w i t h these nodes  describing 
the i n d i v i d u a l nodes. we wish to find a matching of two such graphs. the graphs are not expected to be i d e n t i c a l and we wish to evaluate the transformation 
required to map one graph i n t o the other. barrow1 e t . a l . discuss some approaches to a p a r t i a l graph matching problem of t h i s type. one of these methods t r i e s to find a maximal s e l f - c o n s i s t e n t set of assignments from 
one graph s t r u c t u r e to the other. however  regarding the problem as a graph matching problem ignores important semantics. 
     our matching scheme f i r s t attempts to find a set of best matchings of j o i n t s s a t i s f y i n g piece connecti v i t y r e l a t i o n s . 	the number of joints in a t y p i c a l 
scene is rather small  1 or 1   a l l o w i n g f o r a f a i r l y complete search f o r j o i n t assignments. moreover  the j o i n t s can be ordered in a heirarchy by the size of t h e i r dominant pieces. we need only match the j o i n t s 
at the same l e v e l . 	as example; 	consider a humanoid 
figure w i t h j o i n t s a t 
a  the hips 	  j o i n i n g the legs to the body   
b  the neck and shoulders   j o i n i n g the neck and the arms to the body  and 
c  the two j o i n t s a t t a c h i n g the two hands to the two arms. 
     here the neck j o i n t 	is d i r e c t l y connected to the h i p j o i n t through the body and also to the two hand j o i n t s through the two arms. 	the other j o i n t s have no d i r e c t connections w i t h one another. 	consider t r y i n g to match t h i s description w i t h another one l i k e 	i t . we wish 	to consider matching any j o i n t s 	in 	one d e s c r i p t ion w i t h any other in the second. 	however  	it is clear that if we match the neck j o i n t against 	the neck j o i n t in the other d e s c r i p t i o n   	the c o n n e c t i v i t y r e l a t i o n s of the 	two d e s c r i p t i o n s w i l l be most s i m i l a r . 	there is s t i l l ambiguity about which hand 	j o i n t should match a given hand j o i n t in the other d e s c r i p t i o n . 	in other examples we may have more such ambiguities. 	nonethel e s s   	the number of a l t e r n a t i v e s to be evaluated more f u l l y is d r a s t i c a l l y reduced. 	for t h i s example we 
could also have ordered the j o i n t s in a heirarchy by the size of t h e i r constituent pieces. thus the neck 
and the hip j o i n t s would be of a d i f f e r e n t l e v e l then the hand j o i n t s . we only need to consider the matches 
between two j o i n t s of the same l e v e l   	further reducing 
the size of the search space. 
     we evaluate the t o t a l q u a l i t y of a match by comparing the q u a l i t y of matches of joints and t h e i r pieces in the above assignments. the piece matches are evaluated by the s i m i l a r i t y of t h e i r descriptors  such as r e l a t i v e s i z e s   . we sometimes need to evaluate a l t e r n a t e descriptions of a scene. the model w i t h the best match is computed  and if a s u f f i c i e n t l y good 
match is found  a recognition is claimed. 
     our r e c o g n i t i o n e f f o r t is at a preliminary stage. soon  we hope to be able to recognize objects of the complexity of a toy horse and d o l l as d i s t i n c t from one another and also to recognize the same object from d i f f e r e n t o r i e n t a t i o n s and d i f f e r e n t a r t i c u l a t i o n s of i t s limbs. 

     we would l i k e to express our thanks to g.j. agin for the use of his laser ranging programs and p i c t u r e f i l e s .
