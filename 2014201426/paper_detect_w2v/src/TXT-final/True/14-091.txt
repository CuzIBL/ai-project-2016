program description 
in the l a s t ijcai at tokyo  we presented an approach to knowledge organization and problem solving for diagnostic tasks  and described a prototype system called mdx based on that approach | 1   . several aspects of system design and performance were discussed in  1   and the central theoretical ideas underlying the approach are presented  and further extensions elaborated  in 
 1 . 
there are two key aspects to the methodology : 
 1  the diagnostic knowledge is decomposed into a 
c o l l e c t i o n of hierarchically organized conceptual s p e c i a l i s t s : the scope of the specialists varies from more general to more particular as the hierarchy is traversed from top to bottom.  1  the problem solving proceeds in a top-down manner; the specialists in the hierarchy establish or reject their relevance to the case at hand  and those who have established their relevance pass the control to their successors  u n t i l a l l relevant specialists have added their explanation of abnormal data which the knowledge in their scope can explain. 
　　the mdx system  which is wholly diagnostic in i t s knowledge  communicates with two a u x i l i a r y systems  patrec and radex. patrec is a data base

assistant in the sense it acquires the patient data  organizes them  and answers the queries of mdx concerning the patient data. in a l l these a c t i v i t i e s patrec uses various types of i n f e r e n t i a l knowledge embedded in an underlying conceptual model of the domain of medical data. radex is a radiology consultant to mdx  and it suggests or confirms diagnostic p o s s i b i l i t i e s by reasoning based on i t s knowledge of imaging procedures and relevant anatomy. see  and  for further d e t a i l s about these subsystems. 
　　the current domain of mdx is a syndrome called cholestasis  which covers a large number of specific l i v e r diseases. the p i l o t system was r e s t r i c t e d to extra-hepatic diseases only; however  in the l a s t several months  a large number of intrahepatic diseases have been added. the system is continually tested on a number of cases both from journals and hospital records. mdx is w r i t t e n in lisp  and is quite large : it runs in 1k words 
of dec-1 memory  in addition to the memory 
requirements of the lisp system i t s e l f .
