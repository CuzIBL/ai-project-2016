       the purpose of t h i s communication is to examine one p a r t i c u l a r aspect of discourse s t r u c t u r e   namely  a discourse construct c a l l e d center of a sentence in discourse and i t s r e l a t i o n to the l a r ger issue of c o n t r o l of i n f e r e n c e . f i r s t we w i l l describe very b r i e f l y the n o t i o n of center s  of a

　　　　in a n a t u r a l language sentence in discourse   i n sharp contrast to sentences of a formal l a n guage  one or more e n t i t i e s  arguments of the main predicate  are singled out. we c a l l these the c e n t e r s * . centered e n t i t l e s may be s y n t a c t i c a l l y 
marked but t h i s need not be the case. 
　　　　let si be the current utterance  sentence  and l e t d i - 1 be the preceding discourse  at times only the preceding sentence s i - 1   . we assume that as the discourse is u n f o l d i n g a discourse  model  is 
being created. by  model   f o r the purpose of our present d i s c u s s i o n   we mean simply a data s t r u c t u r e in terms of a set of e n t i t i e s and r e l a t i o n s among them. we are not claiming here that t h i s is a l l there is to a discourse  model   however  f o r our 
immediate purpose t h i s r e p r e s e n t a t i o n would be adequate. in a d d i t i o n to c o n s t r u c t i n g the discourse model  we w i l l assume t h a t we keep t r a c k of those e n t i t i e s which are centered so f a r . our main goal is that in terms of the discourse model together 
w i t h the associated set of c e n t e r s   and the cent e r  s  of the current sentence  we should be able to give some account of the appropriateness  or i n -
appropriateness  of the current sentence si in the discourse context d i - 1 . the n o t i o n of center is relevant to the determination of how the current utterance is i n t e g r a t e d in the discourse  model  constructed so f a r and how the succeeding discourse is to be i n t e g r a t e d in the preceding discourse of 
which the current utterance is now a p a r t . 
　　　　for each utterance  sentence   s i   in d i s course  we w i l l associate two c e n t e r s   c b   s i   : the backward looking center  and c f   s i   : the forward looking c e n t e r   s   * * . c b s i   determines how s i is 
going to be incorporated in the preceding discourse di-1 and thus incrementally augment the current discourse model. c f   s i   determines how s i w i l l get l i n k e d up to the succeeding discourse. we w i l l assume that c b  s i   is always a s i n g l e t o n   i . e . each sentence has only one backward looking center; however  c f   s t   could be a s e t . f u r t h e r   it is 
 this n o t i o n is r e l a t e d to the ai notion of   l o c a l   focus   1   and the notions of topic and focus in l i n g u i s t i c s   but it is not i d e n t i c a l to any of these. 
　we are not concerned here about the determinat i o n of centers. syntactic s t r u c t u r e   s t r e s s   and 
discourse context are some of the determining f a c t o r s . 	for our present purpose it is enough to 
assume that a sentence in discourse has centers.

not necessary that cb si  and cf s i   are disjoint. in an obvious way we can define c f  d i - 1   which would be the set of a l l forward looking centers associated with the preceding discourse di-1.  we have defined cf d i - 1   as a set without any further structure on i t . this is clearly not adequate. some structure on this set is necessary to account for the relative ease  or d i f f i c u l t y   of accessing elements of this set. see examples in section 1. stack organization by itself is not adequate. we w i l l not discuss this issue here due to restriction on allowed space for the paper.  
　　　we w i l l now define  appropriateness  of si in the discourse context di-1. si is  appropriate  in the discourse context d i - 1 if cb si  e c f   d i - 1     i.e. the backward looking center is identical to one of the forward looking centers  or cb si  is a proword for some element in cf di-i   or c s   is functionally dependent on some element of cf di-1 . cf dj.  the set of forward looking centers for di cannot be represented by just the union of cf di-1  and cf si .  see the remark at the end of the previous paragraph.  we do not drop centers 
but allow for some of them to be temporarily placed in the background. 
       the intuitive notion of appropriateness is that if the condition is satisfied the resultant discourse di = di-1 si w i l l be judged to be more coherent  better  well-formed   less awkward than the case when the condition is not satisfied. thus it is not the case that if the condition is not satisfied  s i cannot follow d i - 1 but rather if it does  the resultant discourse di = d i - 1 si w i l l be more d i f f i c u l t to comprehend i . e .   there would be more processing involved in integrating si into the discourse model constructed so far  more as compared to the case when the condition is f u l f i l l e d   . our mathematical treatment so far has attempted to characterize this increased processing in terms of some complexity measures associated with certain inference schemes. 
john is the focus; hence it is cf s i  . b i l l is the cb si  which corresponds to the topic. note that b i l l is not in cf si . in this respect  1  above is different from  1 . the i t - c l e f t construction has the effect of temporarily putting b i l l in the background thereby making it d i f f i c u l t to access b i l l from the set of previously centered ent i t l e s   i . e .   b i l l can be made the center in the cb si-1  * door is not in cf s i    however  it is functionally dependent on house   i . e . the door of the house   hence  la lb  is appropriate. such dependencies could be nested. it is important to note that whenever we have such functional dependencies  we have an effect which is similar to that in i t - c l e f t sentences  i.e.  in 1b si+1: the 
door was locked  cb si+1  = door; house in cf  si  is temporarily put in the background  i . e .   it can 
be brought into the succeeding discourse only by explicit reintroduction. hence  1b1d  is more awkward than  1a'1b'1c'1d' .  the contrast can be made sharper by allowing for further nested functional dependencies.  
john walked up to the house. 
the door was locked. 
but the handle was broken. it  = the house  looked unoccupied for a long time.

	1. 	complexity of inferencing 
　　　we w i l l now briefly describe our formal investigations in complexity of inferencing with respect to the notion of centering. centering contributes to the d i f f i c u l t y of inferencing   i . e . of incorporating si into the discourse model constructed up to di-1   in various ways: 1  violation of centering constraints  1  size of the forward looking centers of di-1 the larger this set the more d i f f i c u l t y in incorporating si 1  the total number of e n t i ties centered in the discourse. in a formal 
model of inference incorporating the notion of center  each of these aspects of discourses relevant to their ease of comprehension may be naturally translated into measures of complexity on the deductions which can be formalized in the 

1 

model. thus each of these measures would impose a complexity ordering on the formal deductions of the model. an inference   i . e . p a i r of premises and conclusion  which could be derived in the model might then be assigned as i t s i n t r i n s i c complexity along one of these measures the minimum complexity of the deductions which derive that i n f e r e n c e . by combining the d i f f e r e n t measures we might a r r i v e at a u s e f u l p a r t i a l ordering of the complexity of i n ferences. it would be p a r t i c u l a r l y i n t e r e s t i n g to show that the inferences which f e l l below a given l e v e l of complexity in such an ordering are s i m -
p l e r than those f a l l i n g above that l e v e l in a computational sense. thus a f i r s t question to consider would be: are the c o l l e c t i o n s of inferences which f a l l below a given l e v e l of complexity along each of the measures considered above decidable s e t s . if so  are the decision procedures for the c o l l e c t i o n s at higher l e v e l s more complex  comput a t i o n a l l y   than the decision procedures f o r lower l e v e l s . 
       in order to i n v e s t i g a t e these questions in any d e t a i l we must choose a formal model of inference and a means of i n c o r p o r a t i n g the n o t i o n of center i n t o that model. in the studies we have completed thus f a r   the model of inference we have chosen is the system of n a t u r a l deduction as formulated by prawitz and our means of i n t r o d u c i n g the notion of center has been to r e q u i r e the centering of parameters which are used as the proper parameters of q u a n t i f i e r i n t r o d u c t i o n and e l i m i n a t i o n r u l e s . by using p r a w i t z ' s n o r m a l i z a t i o n theorem  we have been able to answer the d e c i d a b i l i t y question broached above for the t h i r d measure of complexity i n d i c a t e d above  that in terms of t o t a l number of centered e n t i t i e s   . in p a r t i c u l a r   if  tt is a deduction in prawitz*s system c' l e t c tt  * the number of d i s t i n c t parameters which occur in formulas in tt. let tn ＊ { a | a is a parameter free formula of cf and 1tt  tt is a deduction of a from the empty set of assumptions and c   t t   = n } . 
p r o p o s i t i o n ; 1  for every n  t n is p r i m i t i v e r e c u r s i v e . 
	1  for every n  	t n + 1 	- tn 	= 	1 
       at present we are studying other formal models of inference in order to determine whether a more n a t u r a l i n t r o d u c t i o n of the n o t i o n of center can be achieved than in the case of n a t u r a l deduction. i n p a r t i c u l a r   i t seems that c e n t e r i n g   i f i t plays a genuine r o l e in i n f e r e n t i a l complexity at a l l   ought to be r e l e v a n t to the complexity of i n f e r e n ces in the p r o p o s i t i o n a l as w e l l as in the f u l l predicate c a l c u l u s . our n a t u r a l deduction model does not e x h i b i t t h i s f e a t u r e . indeed  i t i s easy to see that a l l the purely p r o p o s i t i o n a l i n ferences comprehended in the model described above occur in t 1 . hence  our model does not d i s c r i m i nate at a l l among p r o p o s i t i o n a l inferences of d i f f e r i n g complexity. we are c u r r e n t l y studying ways in which the p r o p o s i t i o n a l complexity of i n ferences might be accommodated w i t h i n our model  
a study which seems e s s e n t i a l if the centering phenomenon is to have bearing on the computational complexity of i n f e r e n c l n g procedures.

       in a d d i t i o n   it may be that measures of comp l e x i t y based on the n o t i o n of centering provide a nice s t r u c t u r e only on a proper s u b c o l l e c t i o n of a l l v a l i d inferences i n the p r o p o s i t i o n a l o r p r e d i c a t e c a l c u l u s . this seems p a r t i c u l a r l y plausible in view of the f a c t t h a t such measures were der i v e d from phenomena which a r i s e in n a t u r a l d i s course and the consideration that not a l l v a l i d inferences may be derivable by deductions which c o n s t i t u t e n a t u r a l discourses. the question whether there are proper fragments of the p r e d i cate c a l c u l u s to which the complexity measures considered here more n a t u r a l l y apply is c u r r e n t l y under study.
