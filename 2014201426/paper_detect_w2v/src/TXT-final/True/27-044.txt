 
a consistent text contains rich resources of in formation such as collocation patterns that can be used to resolve ambiguities within its sentences for example attachment ambigui ties in a sentence can be resolved by selecting a candidate attachment that matches attach ments found in other sentences in the same dis course thus  discourse can be regarded as a valuable knowledge resource for sentence anal ysis in this paper  we examine some features of discourse as a knowledge resource and propose a framework for natural language processing that provides a simple algorithm for using information extracted from discourse together with information stored in knowledge bases the experimental results of using our framework to disambiguate sentences in technical documents offer good prospects for improving the at curacy of a broad coverage natural language processing system that handles various texts without constructing knowledge bases for each text in advance some noteworthy fea tures of discourse information are also deduced from the results of our experiments 
1 	introduction 
in natural language processing knowledge resources are indispensable for disambiguating input sentences and a large quantity of such resources is necessary to improve the accuracy of sentence analysis however  constructing knowledge resources from hand-coded data requires enormous amounts of time and human resources and thus leads to a knowledge acquisition bottleneck much research has been devoted to developing methods for resolving ambiguities by using large quantities of knowledge resources that can be acquired semi-automatically from on the texts  brown et al 1 gale et al 1 hindle and rooth  1 jensen and binot  1 na gao  1 utsuro et al 1  uramoto 1l  yet in the day to-day operation of a practical natural language processing system such as a machine translation sys tern it is inevitable that a new text will contain various ambiguities that cannot be resolved with the knowledge 
1 	natural language 
contained in the system moreover a knowledge resource tends to be less effec tive for a text in a new domain 
　on the other hand a consistent text itself contains rich resources of information that can be used to re solve ambiguities within its sentences as shown by gale et al  gale et al 1  and nasukawa  nasukawa  1   polysemous words within the same discourse tend to have the same word sense with a probability of over 1% and the accuracy of word sense disambiguation can be improved b  applying discourse constraints in such a manner that each polysemous word in a discourse takes the same word sense rinoshita et al  rinoshita et al 1  and nasukawa  nasukawa 1  have reported that co-occurrence between words extracted from a text improves the accuracy with which attachment ambiguities in the text are resolved furthermore information extrac ted from discourse by means of a simple algorithm makes it easier to select the correct antecedent of a pro noun from among candidate noun phrases as shown by 
nasukawa  nasukawa  1  
　in this paper  we study the potential usefulness of in formation extracted from discourse in contrast to information stored in knowledgebases  and develop a method based on a simple algorithm that resolves ambiguities in sentences by using information extracted from discourse together with information stored in knowledge bases 
　in the next section we examine a couple of features of discourse information that allow more accurate sentence analysis than is possible with information stored in knowledge bases then  in the third section  we propose a framework of natural language processing that extracts information from a discourse and disambiguates each sentence in the discourse by using the discourse in formation together with information stored in knowledge bases finally  in the fourth section we give the results of experiments on the use of our framework to resolve structural ambiguities 
1 	information extracted from discourse 
in this section we examine two features in discourse that are applicable to sentence disambiguation and compare the information extracted from discourse with the infor mation stored in knowledge bases  in terms of its effec 
tiveness for sentence disambiguation 

1 	discourse constraint and discourse preference 
the first feature we discuss in this section is the  discourse constraint  that polysemous words within a dis course have the same word sense according to gale et al  gale et a/  1  and nasukawa  nasukawa  1  there is a high probability  1% according to gale et al   that polvsemous. words within the same discourse actually carry the same word sense if this discourse constraint is assumed to hold a result of word sense disambiguation applied in one sentence can be shared with all the morphologic all} identical words within the dis course 
　since a valid word sense disambiguation cannot alwavs be made for every word appearing in a text this procedure of sharing the results of word sense disambiguation improves the total accuracy of word-sense disambigua tion for example if a polysemous word appears alone in a title  a heading  or a list item there is no way to disambiguate its word sense except bv referring to infor mation in other sentences 
　the second feature is  discourse preference namelv a tendency for each word to modify or be modified by similar words within a discourse during our analysis of computer manuals  we noticed that the same collocation patterns appeared frequently for example a collocation pattern in which the noun cursor occurred as the suit 
ject of the verb move appeared more than the limes on one page of a computer manual by assuming discourse preference  we obtain another chit on how improve the accuracy of sentence analysis for example consider the following sentences extracted from a computer manual 
 1  type your user name on the user line 
 1  you probably typed it on the line cor rectly but 
sentence  1  actually comes immediately after the sentence  1  in the manual in sentence  1  the modifiee of the prepositional phrase on the user line can be either type or your user name but in sentence  1  on th  line uniquely modifies typed  therefore  by applying the discourse preference that the noun line tends to modify the verb type with the preposition on we can resolve the structural ambiguity of sentence  1  furthermore the candidates for the antecedent of the pronoun it in sentence  1  are your user name and the user line m sentence  1   since both of them satisfy syntactic con straints to select the actual antecedent we can apply discourse preference and thus your user name is pre ferred as an object of the verb type since a collocation pattern in which your user name is the object of the verb typp appears in sentence  1  
1 comparison with information stored in knowledge bases 
in this paper we assume that 
  a general natural language processing system holds one or more knowledge bases that contain informa tion for sentence disambiguation 
  data are initially stored in the knowledge bases and updated through day-to-day operations 
  multiple knowledge bases ma  be provided  to im-prove the accuracy of disambiguation by suppying appropriate information for various domains 
　with the aim of relieving the knowledge acquisition bottleneck we consider an example based approach to sentence disambiguation in which disambiguation is based on information extracted from on line texts for example  a sentence analyzer called sena  uramoto 1l  analyzes a sentence and extracts word to word relationships that basically consist of both a modi fier word and a modifiee word along with a marker of the relation between them  such as preposition case marker and so on  and prefers an attachment candidate that matches word-to word relationships in its knowledge base  in this case an example-base  word toword relationships can be extrac ted from on line texts seni automatically with a little human intervention to eliminate ambiguities in the data  nagao 1 uramoto 1lj within the framework of the examplebased approach it is easy to correct a specific disambiguation error l   adding hand coded word toword relationships and an additional set of hand coded wordto-word relationships may easily improve  the accuracy with which sentences in a specific text can be disam bignaled however a knowledge base that contains only word to word relationships has a disadvantage in its cov eragc  uramoto 1  since the vocabulary as well as the usage of specific words vanes from text to text depending on the writer and the topic improving the cov e rage of word to-word relationships in a practical domain is an important issue in the area of example based s s terns however lt may reduce the particularity of some word to weird relationships sue h as those extracted from an idiomatic expression in which the modifier modifiee relationship may not be general 
　on the other hand information extracted from a dis course contains some ideal features that can be applied to each sentence in the discourse a sentence to be disambiguated and the discourse share the same wnter and the same topic thus information extracted from a dis course is more reliable for disimbiguating a sentence in side the discourse than information in a knowledge base however the discourse cannot be the only resource for sentence disambiguation because 
  not all ambiguities can be covered bv information extracted from 1 the discourse 
  information extrac ted from the discourse mav itself contain ambiguities 
t correct information may not always be extracted from the discourse because of ellipses and analysis failures and tot various other reasons 
examples of these reasons are provided in section 1 along with the results of experime nts on computer man uals to improve the accuracy of sentence disambigua tion we propose to use information extracted from discourse together with information stored in knowledge bases the next section describes the framework of our method

1 	framework for using discourse information 
in this paper we focus on structural ambiguities rather than ail} of the other ambiguities in sentences such as word sense ambiguities since information e tra.c ted from discourse can resolve structural ambiguities with out being supplemented bv other information and the effects of discourse information r in be evaluated separatelv from those of infoniiatioii stored m knowledge bases hesolution of other ambiguities such as selection of a word sense for a polvsemous word  requires liifonnation initially stored in knowledge bases and discourse information is applied in such a manner that mformatiou extracted from knowledge bases is circulated within the discourse in this section therefore we bneflj de stnhc a framework for using information extracted from discourse to disambiguate a sentence hj focusing on its structural ambiguities 
1 	extraction of discourse information 
the first step of our framework is to extrae t information from a discourse while the second step is to resolve the ambiguities in each sentence of the discourse 
　in the first step each sentence in the whole text given as a discourse is processed bv a smitactu parwr and the position of each instance of everv lemma and its modifi.ee modifier relationships with other content words in the parser output are stored as discourse mforiiia tion in accumulation of discourse information prefer ence scores are given for each definite modifier modifier relationship  such as the modification of type t   on the line in sentence  1  and lower scores are gnen for eath ambiguous inodifice-modifier relationship such as the possible modification of type b  on iht user line- in seutence  1  
　table 1 shows an example of such information e  traded from the text of a computer manual consisting 
of sentences such as 
a server shares resource* with other workstations on the lan 
in this table  scores of 1 for each definite modihee modifier relationship and 1 for each ambiguous inoditieemodiher relationship art assigned thus the sentence above yielded preference scores of 1for sm ermodifying share as a subject  1 for workstation posslb.lv modifying share with the preposition with and so on 
1 	structural disambiguation 
to resolve structural ambiguities  the discourse mforiiia tion is referred to for each modifiee c andidau if the same modifiee modifier relationship that is the same collocation pattern  is found in the discourse information  the score of the collocation is extracted and added to the candidate s preference value in order to improve the coverage of the discourse information  an on hue svnonvm dictionary  collins 1  is consulted so that a collocation pattern can be checked with a svnonjm in one side of the collocation  either the modifiee or the modifier  the  score after being multiplied bv a weighting value is then added to its preference value of the 
1 	natural language 
candidate for example to select the verb see as the modifiet of the propositional phrase  for information  in the sentence 
set where to look for additional task  infor matton in  up and running  for innformation on which books to use 
a collocation pattern in which for instruction modifies see extracted from a later sentence in the same discourse  1 sentences after the sentence above 
     for instructions see  up and running is referred to since instruction is defined ls a svnonvm of information in the on line synonym dictionary  collins  1  
　in addition to the dictionary information coordinate structures in discourse information are referred to  and the coordinated words are also treated as synonyms in examining collocation pat terns for example in the sen-
tence 
in the mvs environment tht product runs un der tso/e cics and ims 
tso/e cics and ims art coordmated and thus treated as synoyms in the same discourse 
　information on word to-word relationships stored in knowledge bases also provides preference stores  in addi tion to those given by the discourse information and a store is added to the preference value of cat h candidate modifier after evaluation of the preference value for each candidate modifice  the candidate with the highest preference is selected 
1 	results and discussion 
after implementing our framework on an englishto-japanese machine translation system calletl shalt1  takeda et al  1  we processed a large number of technical documents such as patents technical letters and in particular computer manuals the results were encouraging and we found some interesting phenomena that should be taken into account when information ex traded from discourse is used along with information stored in knowledge bases 
1 	coverage 
the coverage of information used for structural disam bignation is shown in figure 1 the figure reflects the results of disambiguating all the sententces in a computer manual consisting of 1 consecutiv e sentences by chang ing the size of the discourse from 1 to 1 sentences except for the result of referring to the whole 1 sentences as a discourse all the results indicate the averages of the results obtained by referring to eat h of several sample areas as a discourse for example  to obtain data for the case in which the size of a discourse is 1 sentences  we examined 1 areas each consisting of 1 sentences  such as the 1st sentence to the 1th  the 1st to the 1th  and the 1st to the 1th 
　in this experiment  we disambiguated the modifiees of structurally ambiguous phrases such as prepositional phrases  present and past participle clauses  relative
