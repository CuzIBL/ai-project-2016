 data structure  a kind of grapn   we w i l l refer to tnese tnree-way amuiguous symbols as identifiers. we might use tne i d e n t i f i e r 1 for tne node representing tne numoer variously w r i t t e n as  1    dxxi    five nundred twenty-one   etc. in an implementation of a semantic network  we mignt be able to convert the i d e n t i f i e r s  fl  and 1b/ t o integer data types and compute the fact that 1 is numerically greater than 1  out information derived in such a manner is not being derived from the semantic network and is based on knowledge not represented in tne semantic network. 
　sucn knowledge can be represented in a semantic network oy representing the concept of greater-than as a node  storing some greater-tnan facts e x p l i c i t l y   and storing rules for recursively deriving i m p l i c i t greater-than facts from e x p l i c i t ones using formalisms such as those described in shapiro  1. 
syntactic networks 
　a syntactic network nas nodes representing sucn tnings as lexemes  clauses  and syntactic classes and arcs representing such relations as linear order in the surface s t r i n g   membership in a constituent phrase  and dependency of a constituent on i t s governor. an example of a synt a c t i c network is tne cnart of kay  1. 
　we mignt determine that 1 is greater tnan 1 by noting that the numeral b1 lias more d i g i t s tnan tne numeral 1. that tnis is a syntactic tecnnique may be noted by realizing that it does not work for oxxi vs. xxvi. a syntactic network could ue used to represent a numeral as a kind of clause consisting of a linear string of i t s d i g i t s . 
interface 
　ail inter-network arc could be introduced between a semantic node and tne nignest level syntactic node representing the expression of tne concept in some natural language. tne l.l/  arc of snapiro  1 serves sucn a purpose.
