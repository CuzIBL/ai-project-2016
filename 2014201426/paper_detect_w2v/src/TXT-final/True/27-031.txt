ion of the discourse participants' focus of attention  it serves as a record of those entities that are salient at any point in the discourse intentional structure is comprised of discourse segment purposes and their interrelationships  particularly that of dominance a discourse segment purpose  or dsp is a gricean-like  intention that leads to the initiation of a discourse segment one dsp is dominated by another if the satisfaction of the first provides part of the satisfaction of the second 
　intentional structure plays a central role in discourse processing  an agent's comprehension of the utterances in a discourse relies on the recognition of this structure  grosz and sidner 1  grosz and sidner  proposed sharedplans to provide a basis for recognizing intentional structure they argued that discourses are fundamentally collaborative  and hence that a model of shared plans provides a more appropriate basis for discourse processing than a model of single-agent plans however  the connection between sharedplans and intentional structure was never specified

we have developed a model of discourse processing that provides that connection  lochbaum  1  figure 1 illustrates the role of sharedplans in modeling intentional structure each segment of a discourse has an associated sharedplan the purpose of the segment is taken to be intention that  int th  grosz and kraus  1   the discourse participants form that plan this intention is held by the agent who initiates the segment in what follows  we will refer to that participant as the initiating conversational participant or icp  the other participant is the ocp  grosz and sidner  1  dominance relationships between dsps are modeled using subsidiary relationships between sharedplans one plan is subsidiary

　　the term discourse segment is a generalization of the term subdialogue whereas the term discourse segment applies to all types of discourse  the term subdialogue is reserved for segments that occur within dialogues

to another if the completion of life first plan contributes to the completion of the second subsidiary relationships are discussed in more detail in section 1 
　the utterances of a discourse are understood in terms of their contribution to the sharedplans associated with the segments of the discourse those segments that have been completed at the time of processing an utterance have a full sharedplan  fsp  associated with them  e g   segment  1  in figure 1   while those that have not have a partial sharedplan  psp   e g   segments  1  and  1  in figure 1  
　for each utterance of a discourse  an agent must determine whether the utterance begins a new segment of the discourse contributes to the current segment  or completes it  grosz and sidner  1  for an utterance to begin a new segment  it must indicate the initiation of a subsidiary plan this case is described in further detail below for an utterance to contribute to the current segment  it must advance the partial sharedplan associated with the segment towards completion that is  it must establish one of the beliefs or intentions required for the discourse participants to have a full sharedplan  but missing from their current partial sharedplan for an utterance to complete the current segment  it must indicate that the purpose of that segment has been satisfied for that to be the case  the sharedplan associated with the segment must be an fsp rather than a psp that is  all of the beliefs and intentions required of an fsp  as indicated in figure 1  must have been established over the course of the segment 
　a detailed description of the implemented algorithms used in modeling each of these cases can be found elsewhere  lochbaum  1  here  we focus on the use of knowledge preconditions in accounting for the initiation of information seeking subdialogues we use the dialogue in figure 1 as an example and assume the role of the expert  participant  e   in analyzing the discourse 1 the dialogue in figure 1 was extracted from a larger dis-

reasoning 
　one plan is subsidiary to another if the completion of the first plan contributes to the completion of the second the most basic example of this relationship occurs within the fsp definition itself as indicated in figure 1  a full plan for an act a includes full plans for each subact in a s recipe as. components  requirements  1c  and  1b   the plans for the subacts thus contribute to the plan for a and are therefore subsidiary to it 
　subsidiary relationships may also arise in response to the other requirements of the fsp definition for example  as discussed in section 1 the bcba operator used to model requirement  1b  specifies that to be able to perform an act a  an agent must  1  have a recipe for a  has recipe    1  be able to identify the parameters of a  has sat descr  and  1  have satisfied the constraints associated with performing a the first of these requirements provides an explanation for the first subdialogue in figure 1 
the purpose of this subdialogue is represented as 
   
and can be glossed as  the apprentice intends that the agents collaborate on his obtaining a recipe for the act of removing the flywheel of the air compressor   to ac count for the apprentice s initiation of this subdialogue the expert must determine the relationship of dsp1 to the purpose of the agents' preceding discourse namely dsp1 in this case  the expert can reason that the apprentice wants to engage in the subdialogue to obtain a recipe for the act of removing the flywheel so that he will be able to perform that act as part of the agents sharedplan to remove the pump the plan in dsp1 is

　　we have omitted the time parameters for simplicity of exposition 1 we describe a method for recognizing dsps of this form elsewhere  lochbaum  1

thus subsidiary to that in dsp1 by virtue of a knowledge precondition requirement of the latter plan 
　figure 1 illustrates this analysis each box in the figure corresponds to a discourse segment and contains the sharedplan used to model the segment's purpose the sharedplans are labeled so as to be co-indexed with the dsps discussed above the arrows indicate subsidiary relationships between sharedplans  as explained by the text that adjoins them when plan pj is subsidiary to plan p1  dspj is dominated by dsp  
　the information represented within each sharedplan in figure 1 is separated into two parts those beliefs and intentions that have been established at the time of the analysis are shown above the dotted line  while those that remain to be established  but that are used in determining subsidiary relationships  are shown below the line the index in square brackets to the right of each constituent indicates the fsp requirement from which 
the constituent arose 
　as indicated in figure 1  the initiation of the second subdialogue in figure 1 is explained similarly this time however  it is the need to identify parameters of acts  requirement  1  above  that leads to the initiation of the subdialogue in addition  the parameter in question is a parameter of an act in a subsidiary individual plan of the apprentice's 
1 	discussion 
in this paper  we have shown that information-seeking subdialogues may be explained on the basis of knowledge precondition requirements our account of such subdialogues fits within a general framework for discourse processing in which the purpose of a subdialogue 1 modeled using a sharedplan and is related to the purposes of other subdialogues based on the requirements of the fsp definition elsewhere  lochbaum  1   we show that correction and subtask subdialogues  among others  may also be accounted for in this manner 
　in contrast  alternative plan-based accounts of dialogue understanding introduce multiple types of plans to account for the utterances in a discourse for example  litman and allen   propose the use of two types of plans to model clarification and correction subdialogues discourse plans and domain plans domain plans represent knowledge about a task  while discourse plans represent conversational relationships between ut terances and plans litman and allen provide operators 
for the following discourse plans 
  introduce-plan introduce a new plan for die-cussion 
  continue-plan execute the next action in a plan 
  track-plan talk about the execution of an ac-tion 
  modify-plan introduce a new plan by modify-ing a previous one 
  correct-plan correct a plan 
  identify-parameter identify a parameter of an action in a plan 
1 	naturai language 
　under our approach  the recognition of discourse plans is unnecessary the fact that a speaker is using an utterance to  for example  introduce a plan  or track a plan  or identify a parameter  need not be explicitly recognized for the purposes of utterance interpretation furthermore  we would argue that such facts are not intended to be recognized  cf grice   rather  they 
simply fall out of recognizing the relationship of an utterance to the current discourse structure  1 e   the currently active sharedplans for example  introduceplan corresponds to initiating a new discourse segment  continue- or track-plan to contributing to the current segment  and identify-parameter to initiating a new segment to satisfy a has sat descr knowledge precondition requirement although the initiation of a new sharedplan corresponds to the initiation of a new discourse segment under our approach  it is the sharedplan that must be recognized and not a discourse plan that refers to that sharedplan 
　lambert and carberry  have extended litman and allen s approach by introducing a third type of plan problem-solving plans  such as build-plan and instantiate-vars  are used to model the process by which agents construct domain plans under our approach  the need to explicitly recognize problemsolving plans is also avoided the fact that an agent is building a plan or instantiating a variable is a byproduct of understanding an utterance by relating it to the current discourse structure build-plan corresponds to initiating a new discourse segment to satisfy a has recipe knowledge precondition requirement while instantiate-vars corresponds to initiating one to satisfy a has eat descr requirement unlike lambert and carberry's approach  however  and litman and allen's as well  our approach actually recognizes this structure the other approaches are essentially utteranceto-utterance based and thus do not recognize discourse segments as separate units 
　ramshaw  has added a different third type of plan  exploration plans  to litman and allen's two types exploration plans are intended to model the process by which agents explore courses of actions although we have not yet incorporated such reasoning into our model  we hypothesize that the exploration of plans can be modeled  without the introduction of a new plan type  by reasoning about an agent's potential intentions and the process by which they become full-fledged intentions  grosz and kraus  1  bratman et al  1  
　these alternative approaches share an important property that distinguishes them from our approach they take a data-structure view of plans  rather than a mental phenomenon view  pollack  1  whereas data-structure plans are essentially  recipes-for-action   mental phenomenon plans are a  structured collection of beliefs and intentions   pollack  1  pg 1  1 datastructure plans thus describe what an agent is doing with an utterance  but not why the agent is doing it for example  although the constraints of litman and allen's identify-parameter discourse plan force the plan to be related to another plan that involves the parameter to be identified  identify-parameter does not explain why this information is desired  it does not capture that agents need to know parameters to be able to perform acts involving them it thus fails to model the essential knowledge precondition nature of identifying a parameter although it is possible to impose a mental phenomenon interpretation on top of a data-structure plan  doing so does not result in a mental phenomenon plan  pollack  1  saying that gl intends to identify a parameter fails to address why gl intends to do so 
　the need to explain an utterance is not unique to interpretation moore and paris  have shown that a similar need exists in generation in particular  they have argued that rst-based text plans must he augmented with intentional structure otherwise  a system has no record of why it said what it did and is thus unable to respond effectively if a hearer does not understand or accept its utterances

in this paper  we have presented an axiomatization of knowledge preconditions for the sharedplan model of collaborative activity  grosz and kraus  1  we have also shown how the requirements of knowledge preconditions can be used to account for information-seeking subdialogues in discourse our account of this phenomenon fits within a general framework for discourse processing in which sharedplans and relationships among them are used to model the intentional component of grosz and sidner's  l1  theory of discourse structure unlike the alternative approaches  our approach recognizes and makes use of discourse structure in addition  it does 
not require the introduction of new plan types
