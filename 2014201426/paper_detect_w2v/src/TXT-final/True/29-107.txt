1 preliminary experiments 
a prototype system has been implemented in matlab which extracts the four most significant dramatic changes in a time-varying signal using the multiscale edge detector wavelet described in mallat and zhong  and scale space theory  witkin  1 . this system has been tested on ten sets of monthly temperature data and the forty features automatically extracted were compared to handwritten descriptions of the same datasets. 1 features chosen by the expert were also extracted automatically. 
1 future work 
future work is planned in three broad areas: 
¡¡i language analysis - analysing real texts to confirm the types of phenomena described and how they are realised. 
¡¡1  inferencing theory - determining appropriate techniques to infer descriptions at appropriate scales of detail for different datasets and comparing these chosen techniques with existing methods such as statistical modelling. 
¡¡1 system development - implementing the techniques and integrating with real language output.
