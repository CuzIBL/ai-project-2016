introduction 
     the general goal of processes operating on visual data in the visions system is the construction of a symbolic representation of the objects  and of the relations among those objects  from images of a given natural outdoor scene. recent experiments have been designed to determine the effectiveness of the use of world knowledge in the interpretation task and to explore representations of this knowledge   1   . a portion of the knowledge used in the system consists of descriptions of specific objects  e.g. house  tree  grass  etc.  and the representation of three-dimensional spatial relationships among those objects   1   . this paper discusses one way in which such geometric knowledge can be used to control image processing. the use of geometric knowledge to guide image processing has been used with some success by   1       1     and   1   . 
　　　in the experiments described here  a three-dimensional scene model which represents the relative location and size of objects is projected to the two-dimensional image to form a plan. this plan can be used to restrict image analysis to certain portions of the image and to trigger the application of procedures for the recognition of specific objects during image interpretation. the results w i l l be illustrated using the house scene shown in figure 1.

region segmentation into non-disjoint subsets of regions  each containing the projection of an object from the scene. the data used is an i n i t i a l segmentation of the image into regions of similar color and texture   1   . an image region does not necessarily correspond to a single object  nor is it the case that a given object will unfailingly project to a single region. scene knowledge can be used to partially overcome these d i f f i c u l t i e s through the formation of a plan which predicts the location of the image projection of actual scene objects. the subimage produced by a matching process which uses this plan can then be further processed to better extract the image location of the object. one possibility is resegmentation  which can be performed with greater accuracy using the local image context . specific knowledge of the surface features of the object can also be used to constrain the subimage even further. 
　　　if a l l the objects in a scene were of known size  shape  and at a known location and orientation  and if the scene were viewed with a known camera from a known camera position and orientation  then the scene model would be easily projected to the image using the standard techniques of computer graphics: rigid object transformation  perspective projection  and hidden surface removal   1   . in general  however  the scene model must capture uncertainties as to object location and permit projection methods that are tolerant to errors in expectations of camera position and orientation. consequently  several less constraining assumptions were made.

scene and object model 
　　　the three-dimensional geometry of an object in a scene can be characterized by: l o c a t i o n   o r i e n t a t i o n   scale   s i z e     and shape. of these  shape is obviously the most complex. easing the constraint on shape by generalization to a sphere permits a rough description of l o c a t i o n   location uncertainty  and size. the location of an object  expressed in the coordinate system of the scene model  is approximated by the center of a   l o c a t i o n sphere.  the radius of t h i s sphere expresses uncertainty as to location of the object center. the object size is also represented by a sphere  centered at the object l o c a t i o n . the radius of t h i s  size sphere  is related to the size of the object. because these spheres are embedded in a scene coordinate system  the addition of a camera model permits the transformation of the scene model  by t r a n s l a t i o n and rotation  to a specific viewpoint and the projection of that model to the 
image. 
projection of scene model to image 
　　　there are two problems in the projection of t h i s three-dimensional model to the image: the projection of the location sphere and the projection of the size sphere. the projection of the location sphere is straightforward. using a perspective transformation  from a camera model  the center and radius of the sphere are projected to the image as a c i r c l e . figure 1 i l l u s t r a t e s the way in which t h i s three-dimensional object model can be projected onto any image  using a camera model  to form an image-specific plan for that object. 
       the projection of the size sphere is handled in a s l i g h t l y d i f f e r e n t manner. due to uncertainty of the exact l o c a t i o n   just the radius of the size model is projected to the image. the projected radius is added to the plan as a  size f i l t e r ;   no region greater than that size is expected as a projection of that object. in the experiments shown here t h i s size radius was added to the location radius to form a composite plan  shown as the outer c i r c l e in figure 1. the other two c i r c l e s shown are: the projection of the location sphere  the smaller of the two inner c i r c l e s   and the projection of the size sphere  the next larger c i r c l e   a r b i t r a r i l y positioned at the center of the projection of the location sphere. note t h a t   although these i l l u s t r a t i o n s show t i g h t l y constrained locations  small location spheres   it is possible to represent small objects and/or larger uncertainties in l o c a t i o n . 
　　　once the model has been projected to the image  the resulting plan can be used in a matching process. regions in the image can be matched against the projection c i r c l e s to form a subimage. a l l regions that are contained within the composite c i r c l e are taken to be candidates for inclusion in the subimage. further  a l l regions for which the r a t i o of region area within the c i r c l e to the t o t a l region area is above an object-model-specific threshold are accepted as candidates for i n c l u s i o n . these candidates are then f i l t e r e d by s i z e   and any region which is too large is r e j e c t e d .  such rejected candidates could be s p l i t by resegmentation; t h i s was not done here.  the union of the remaining candidates forms the sub image.
