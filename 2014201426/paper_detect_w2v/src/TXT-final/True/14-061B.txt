 
　　a general scheme to aid in the selection of therapies is described a topological sorting procedure within a general production rule representation is introduced the procedure is used to choose among competing therapies on the basis of precedence rules this approach has a degree of naturalness that lends itself to automatic explanation of the choices made a system has been implemented using this approach to develop an expert system for planning therapies for patients diagnosed as having ocular herpes simplex an abstracted example of the system s output on an actual case is given* 
i introduction 
　　several knowledge-based programs h1ve been written that go beyond diagnosis and proceed to recommend treatments the mycin program   l   used a production rule scheme to arrive at a diagnosis however it contained special routines and a separate class of rules for the selection of potential therapies the lack of a general procedure severely limits attempts at automatic explanation of therapy the casnet  program linked treatments to the assumed progression of the disease diagnosed however a clear explanation of the reasoning behind the choice of therapy was lacking early work on the digitalis therapy advisor  gave that program some capability for explanation of the chosen therapy it accomplished this by translating a trace of the code used more recent work on that subject  attempted to provide explanations based on knowledge of a consulting program generated from an automatic programmer an extensive domain model of facts about the application was required the capability to achieve good performance in general has not yet been demonstrated by an automatic programming approach 
　　most other expert consultation systems attempted to explain their choice of treatment in terms of a trace of the reasoning process -tailored to the application these approaches do not seem to be easily transferable to other domains this paper describes a procedure that integrates well with a production rule scheme and has been found natural for the selection of treatments and the explanation of that selection

　　the sort procedure is integrated into a rule-based system that performs the diagnosis and therapy selection the example that will be used here was abstracted from an actual case the system made the following diagnosis 
diagnosis 
the evidence strongly suggests patient severely allergic to tnfluorthymidine lesion resistant to idoxundme corneal ulcer  and active infectious herpetic corneal infection 
since the patient was diagnosed to be severely allergic to vidarabme and resistant to idoxundme the order of preference of the available drugs can be calculated vidarabme   tr if luorthymidi ne   idoxundme 
before the treatment recommendation can be made  choices must be made concerning such matters as the route of administration dosage  and length of treatment here other precedence sort rules were used in conjunction with production rules to arrive at the complete treatment recommendation 
treatment recommendation 
the evidence strongly suggests you should administer vidarabme ointment five times daily reexamine in 1 to 1 days 
iii explanation 
　　a major benefit of the sort is the ability to readily explain the reasoning behind a choice of therapy here tnfluorthymidine was chosen because the patient was allergic to vidarabme and the disease was resistant to idoxundme by associating explanatory strings with each sort key the following explanation of the choice is automatically output 

alternative 	treatment  
the evidence moderately suggests that you should administer tnfluorthymidine drops every two hours during the day reexamine in 1 to 1 days 
iv advantages and limitations 
　　the sort precedence rules can be easily and succinctly described for the above example  the desired sort is described in the model by 1 short lines this replaced an equivalent twenty one expert production rules each of which is composed of multiple disjuncts a binary decision tree to accomplish this same task would consist of several thousand nodes 
　　the sort procedure requires a few assumptions of the disease model the ordering of importance of the sort keys must be strict for instance  in this case resistance is a more important factor than allergy no interdependencies between or combinations of the keys is considered for the application chosen in this study  these assumptions have not presented any difficulties as part of the development of a general system for therapy planning  this approach is being examined for applicability in more complex domains 
v concluding remarks 
　　this paper presents an approach to therapy selection which lends itself to explanation the precedence scheme can be easily and succinctly represented and provides a qualitative approach to therapy selection that has been found natural for an application to the domain of ocular herpes simplex the approach has been integrated into a 
　　planning system although a particular domain has provided impetus for the development of the approach presented  the method is general and is currently being tested in another domain  the treatment of rheumatic diseases
