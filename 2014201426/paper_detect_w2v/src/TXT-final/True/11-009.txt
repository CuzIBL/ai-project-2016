system implementation 	then it suggests a hypothesis that small loops 
i t near the t r e e would be f r u i t s   and the procedural knowledge on the shape of the f r u i t t e s t s these 
the 	loops. 	the rock and besi are i n t e r p r e t e d as an 

unknown object because shape has not any knowledge on the rock. the interpretation of the frame is stored in frame model. 
     since the difference between two successive frames is very small  frame model suggests the location and property of each segment of the objects in the coming frame. 	thus  we can reduce the com-
puting time for analyzing the new frame by 1. scene analyzer also examines the correspondence of each part of the unknown object with that of the preceding frame  and it discriminates an unknown moving object from a s t i l l one  the rock . when the frame of fig.1 b  is analyzed  the cues for suggesting that the moving object would be besi is recovered  and shape identifies a l l parts of besi  fig.1 c  . 
motion analysis 
     motion analyzer compares the locations of the actor and the objects in successive frames  and judges which one is really moving. since the relative movement of a s t i l l object is caused by a camera movement  motion analyzer tests whether 
most objects in a picture move in a similar way. if so  the displacement is considered as the camera movement  and the origin of the coordinates is shifted so as to compensate the movement. 
¡¡¡¡next  motion analyzer parses the film into scene groups; each group has successive frames in 
which the actor moves in a similar way. the actor's movement is described in dynamic scene model  fig.1 . the film is segmented into a groups  and scene group 1 is described as  m besi right   besi moves rightwards. changes of the relations between the actor and the objects are also examined; for example  motion analyzer finds a f r u i t   an apple  is moving in scene group 1  so that it examines i t s relation to besi  and adds  tc besi apple  besi touches the apple to the model. also it examines the validity of the relation in the past frames  and updates the model. 
deduction of actions 
     now let us consider how people infers concepts of actions from a descrption besi moves rightwards. we probably deduce besi walks rightwards after reasoning the following items.  l moving one is a human being.  1 he moves to a horizontal direction implies he walks or runs.  1 if his legs move fast then the motion is run  else walk.  1 right is a horizontal direction.  1 besi is equivalent to a human being.  1 the reason why one moves to a direction is to transfer itself. 
     a p r i o r i knowledge about the mini-world such as  1  and  1  is stored in a semantic network property. action concept stores the knowledge about each action: a  static conditions are predicates which must be true for assuring the specific action is performed; 1  for the above example   b  dynamic conditions are described in the procedural knowledge for logical reasoning from state transitions:  1   1  for walk.  c deduced knowledge is one assured by the actual performance of the action;  1  for the above example. 
     the deduction subsystem utilizes these concepts to deduce actions from dynamic scene model. the subsystem finds an action matched to a motion pattern  and then it tests other conditions for the action. for example  the success in matching  m besi right  to a description  m x y  in an action move makes the subsystem test the other conditions  x is animate  x comes near to y. 
since the both conditions are satisfied   move besi tree  is deduced. the description also matches to a condition for walk  and  walk besi tree  is deduced by examining other conditions for walk. after similar deductions  the film is described as    walk besi tree    jump besi apple   
  jump besi apple  hold besi apple    hold besi apple   . finally  the system searches for actions unifying a series of actions  and it deduces    catch besi apple   . fig.1  examples of dialogue of qa-system  shows how the system understands the f i l m .
