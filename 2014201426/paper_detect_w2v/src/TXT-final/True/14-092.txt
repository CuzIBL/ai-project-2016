 	the dlmonstration 

       the purpose of this demonstration is to prove that the implementation on a micro computer of a complete version of an a . i . language  prolog in our case  is a to day r e a l i t y . 
       we present the apple ii ve rsion of a complete  portable  prolog system   l   . the system is implemerited in candide. a language spi ecially designed to write the prolog interpreter  this language produces code for a v i r t u a l machine mi cromegas. it 1 r. important to notice that such a system could not be implemented on a micro comput er without using a floppy-disk v i r t u a l memory. we have demonstrated in a previous paper that t h l s approach yields reasonable performance with good r e l i a b i l i t y . 
characteristics of thl implementation 
　　　　the system is implemented on an apple i i   with : 1k of rnomnry two 1 kb floppy disks and the language card 1 kb  and ucso pascal  
for a price of about $1. 
       the micromegas emulator has been embedded into the ucsd pascal system and consists in 1 pages of pascal code   i n i t i a l i s a t i o n s and 1  plus 1 pages of 1 machine language code  performing the instructions of the micromegas machine . the prolog interpreter occupies 1kb of micromegas code. the v i r t u a l memory system is implemented on the two floppy disks and the main memory paging area occupies 1 pages  of 1sb bytes . 
       a complete version of the system was operational on may-1. despite of some slownass it re-
mains very usable  thanks to i t s improved interac t l v i t y . first experiments with the system show that having prolog available on a micro computer is very stimulating. a lot of programs have been 
written with this new version. in particular  already existing prolog programs have been translated such as a natural language communication system. 
　　　　this version allows to develop prolog program in nice conditions  with two floppies  you can have up to 1 pages prolog programs . it is also very suitable for teaching. 
       the capabilities of the system are i l l u s t r a ted by a collection of small prolog programs developed in our laboratory  p a r t i c u l a r l y a natural language data base query system. we w i l l try to run every prolog program suggested by the participants  at the conference. 
       during the demonstration  we w i l l be pleased to discuss the transportation of the system to other machines  large or micro  with interested poeple. 
　　　　a f u l l y documented version of the apple ii prolog system w i l l be delivered next september. a micromegas implementation manual w i l l be also available and. on january 1  a fortran or pascal micromegas'emulator w i l l allow to run the system on  almost  a l l computers. 
 last stops towards on ultimate prolog  in the same proceedings .
