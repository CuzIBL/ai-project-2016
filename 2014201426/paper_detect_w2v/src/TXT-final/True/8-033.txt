an a r t i f i c i a l belief system capable of conducting on-line dialogues with humans has been constructed. it accepts information  answers questions and establishes a credibility for the information it acquires and for its human informants. beginning 
with beliefs of high credibility from a highly believed source  the system is being subjected to the experience of dialogues with other humans. 
introduction 
　　　imagine an extraterrestrial entity sent to earth to collect information from human beings. it has no senses  as we know them  and it cannot move about. its only means of communication is through written language. thus the information it acquires w i l l be dependent upon what it is told by human beings in written dialogues. after it has participated in dialogues with a number of 
humans  what would it believe  
　　　we have realized this imagined situation by creating an a r t i f i c i a l belief system  abs}  in the form of a computer program. our goal was to study certain properties of credibility functions in a synthesized a r t i f i c i a l system whose structure and starting conditions were entirely under our control. before describing the artifact and its behavior  perhaps something should be sa i.d abuut the research strategy involved and its relevance to a r t i f i c i a l intelligence. 
　　　one synthesizes an imaginary system to . . simplity a computer problem and to bring variability under control. in the case of credibility processes in humans we are dealing with complex intelligent behavior d i f f i c u l t to control and manipulate. hence  one would like to work with a simpler system showing some of the essential properties of a human belief system. 
　　　given that one creates such a system to achieve exactness  simplicity and conciseness  how is the artifact to be manipulated or set in conceptual motion  a r t i f i c i a l intelligence provides a way of reversing the traditional technique of experimentation with humans. instead of placing a person under the a r t i f i c i a l conditions of a laboratory experiment  we can subject an a r t i f j e i a l system to the naturally-occurring conditions of 
human linguistic communication. our purpose is to study the processes of credibility functions in a synthesized artifact designed to perform the intelligent task of arriving at states of belief 
or disbelief about what it is told by persons in dialogues. 
　　　some parallels between these processes in an a r t i f i c i a l belief system and in human credibility development w i l l be apparent in later sections. however we are not here attempting to simulate a human belief system. such el torts are described elsewhere. 1 
　　　we shall begin with a general description of the artifact abs}  the subscript 'one1 indicates this is the f i r s t version of a class of anticipated models. 
starting conditions 
　　　abs1 is a computer program  written in mlisp  which runs in an interactive mode on the pdp-1/lo time-sharing system of the stanford a r t i f i c i a l intelligence project. mlisp is a l i s t processing language which translates algol-like m-cxpressions into the s-expressions of lisp 1..1.1 
　　　the program instructions of abs1 consist of rules of handling input strings and for generating output replies. when a human informant communicates with abs1 from a terminal  he types whatever he wishes using any vocabulary names he chooses. in order to avoid many of the complexities of natural language expressions  the syntax is restricted to certain forms. 
　　　the f i r s t form is termed a statement. its pattern is subject-field  verb-field  modifierf i e l d . the subject and modifier fields can contain any number of words of any type except linking verbs. the verb field is limited to third person singular forms in three tenses of linking verbs  be  seem  appear  feel  become . the verb can be optionally preceded by an auxiliary  can  could  must  ought  would  should  shall  will  and followed by a modal operator  certainly  probably  possibly  plus a determiner  a  an  the   the negation 'not' is also permitted. modal operators allow persons to express degrees and directional strength of relations about a probablistic world. a statement ends with a period. here are some examples of statements: 
 1  john is a man. 
 1  john is certainly not an intellectual. 
-1- 1  my brother john was a truck driver. 
 1  young peter w i l l probably not be e problem in school. 
 1  disease seems to be a cause of death. 
　　　two interrogative forms are permitted: 	subject-verb-modifier or verb-subject-modifier  	f o l lowed by a question mark. 	these are examples of questions. 
 1  is john an intellectual  
 1  john is not an intellectual  
　　　a fourth syntactical form allows expectancy or implication rules in the format x  verbfield   modifier-field  implies x  verb-field   modifier-field  followed by a period. for example: 
 1  x 	is a man implies 	x 	is certainly a person. 
 1  x is an italian implies x is probably a catholic. 
 1  x is a white southerner implies x is possibly a racist. 
 1  x 	is a $ b i l l 1 implies 	x 	is a wasp. 
the term 'implies' here does not refer to logical implication. 	these rules correspond to the expec-
tancies of psychological implication in which  given that one situation is the case  a human expects a second situation to be the case. 
　　　rules contain two sorts of variables. the variable 'x' stands for 'anything'. a variable beginning with a dollar-sign followed by the 
informants name and a number is termed a constrained variable. it is defined by an informant as he chooses. thus the conjunctive definition of $bill1 might be: 
$ b i l l 1 is a white man. 
$bill1 is an anglo saxon. 
$bill1j- is a protestant. 
for a person to be substituted into the variable $bill1  facts about him would have to f i t the requirements stated. constrained variables can be nested. disjunctive definitions are handled by a function any    whose argument determines the number of facts required to meet the requirements of the constrained variable. constrained variables allow implicational rules to be of arbitrary complexity while at the top level they remain a single expression consisting of two expressions linked by the term 'implies'. 
　　　when input in any of these four forms is typed i n   the program undertakes a number of operations. at the very start abs1 consists only of program rules with no data. a l l eventual data derive from subsequent written communication with humans. when abs1 begins its dialogue with a person  it requires his name  and recognizes it if he 
has been conversed with previously. if so  it simply prints out 'go ahead'. if not  it prints out instructions regarding its allowable formats. we shall describe what happens to each type of input during the conversational phase termed 'talktime'. 
statements and rules 
　　　a statement is characterized by its format and by a period as its terminal symbol. upon entry a statement is put on the statement l i s t of the current informant engaging in the dialogue. a reply is then output to the informant which indicates that the input has been received and that abs1 awaits the next input. thus in handling statements during talktime  abs1 simply absorbs them in a sponge-like fashion  stores them in its data base and indicates that it is ready for more information. it prehends what it is told in the form of statements and considers them to be facts of observation. 
　　　a rule is characterized by its format in which two expressions containing variables are connected by the term 'implies'. on entry a rule is put on the rule l i s t of the informant. the reply 'rule o.k.' is output and abs-j  awaits further input. 
questions 
　　　when an informant enters an expression in the form of a question  abs1 stores it on the informant's question l i s t and then seeks to answer the question. suppose the question was: 
	q l  	' i s walla ce a racist ' 
abs1 f i r s t searches the questioner's statement l i s t of expressions looking for two sorts of statements   a  a direct identity or negation statement or  b  a similar statement which could answer the question. a direct identity statement would be: s l  'wallace is a r a c i s t . ' 
a direct negation statement would be: 
	s 1  	'wallace is not a r a c i s t . ' 
　　　similar statements  in which the verb-field content of the input question and the statement found are considered similar  would be: 
	s 1  	'wallace was probably a racist.' 
	s 1  	'wallace seems to be a racist.' 
	s 1  	'wallace is possibly a r a c i s t . ' 
-1-or any of these statements containing the negation 'not 1 . 
　　　if s l  is found on the informant's statement l i s t abs1  outputs the reply: 
	r l  	'yes  wallace is a racist  according 

where the blank is f i l l e d in by the informant's name. if s 1  is found the reply i s : 
	r 1  	'no  wallace is not a racist  according 

　　　if both statements  i.e.  a contradiction  existed on the informant's statement l i s t   the f i r s t one found is used for a reply. the state-
ment l i s t is organized with the most recent expressions at the top and abs1 considers the most recent of two contradictory statements to be the more representative of the informant's current state. such a principle also holds for similar statements. that is  if a similar statement such as s 1  is found f i r s t the reply would be: 
	r 1  	'no. but wallace seems to be a racist 

even though a direct identity or negation might exist deeper down in the statement l i s t . thus abs   allows more recent statements to count more heavily in answering questions. 
　　　another type of expression on the statement l i s t can qualify as a reply to  this is a statement such as 
s 1  'wallace is probably a racist.  previous conclusion '. 
which was not input by the informant but which absj concluded to be a fact from an earlier conversation with this particular informant. 	how such a conclusion is generated w i l l become clear by considering what happens when statements such as s l -s 1  are not found. 
　　　the search up to this point has been concerned with statements  i.e.  facts. if direct or similar facts are lacking  abs1 turns to the use of rules and attempts to infer a factual conclusion which could answer the question. in replying to q l  the relevant implication rules would be ones containing the term 'racist' such as: 
l   l   x is a wasp southerner implies x is probably a racist 
or 
1  x is a racist implies x is certainly a bigot. 
if l   l   in which the term 'racist' appears on the right-side of the rule  is found on the informant's rule l i s t   a search is made among the facts to see if the left-side of the rule can be satisfied with 'wallace' being the value of the subject variable x . if the fact 
	s 1  	wallace is a wasp southerner 
is found  then the fact 'wallace is a racist' is generated and stored on the statement l i s t of the informant as a conclusion made by abs1  while conversing with the informant. the reply to q l  
would then be: 
r 1  'yes  wallace is probably a racist because x is a wasp southerner implies x is probably a racist  according to --  and wallace is a wasp southerner 

　　　using an implicational rule from l e f t to right is in the direction of finding strong confirmatory evidence. 	another inference process moves from right to l e f t in a direction of what is considered to be weaker supportive evidence. 	if the rule l 1  
were found along with the fact: 
	s 1  	'wallace is certainly a bigot.' 
then a weaker conclusion would be generated and the reply would be 
r 1  'wallace is possibly a racist because x is a racist implies x is certainly a bigot  according to --  and wallace is certainly a bigot  according to - -     ' 
　　　a number of rules can be combined through backward chaining to establish a conclusion. 	the number of rules used depends on a parameter which can be set to yield an inference process of any desired depth. 	for example  suppose the rules were: 
1  x is a red-neck implies x is a lower middle class southerner. l i|-  x 	is a lower middle class southerner 
implies 	x 	is a hater of negroes. 1  x 	is a hater of negroes implies 	x 	is a racist if the input question was: 
	q 1  	'is maddox a racist'  
the rule l 1  would be found and then an attempt made to find the fact 'maddox is a hater of negroes'. if this search f a i l s   abs1 backs up to rule l 1  and a search made for a factual match of the l e f t side of the rule. if that f a i l s   abs1 backs up to rule 1   if the fact 'maddox is a red neck' is found then the conclusion that 'maddox is a racist' 
would be established. the conclusion is output as a reply to q 1  along with the chain of reasoning and facts used to reach this conclusion. 
-1-　　　it is important to notice that while the inference processes of abs   is 'logical' in the sense of using valid reasoning with various degrees fo strength  the semantic or conceptual nature of the expectancy rules may determine a conclusion which mig it seem peculiar to the pure logician. for instance if the rule acquired from an informant stated: 
l 1  	x 	is a racist implies 	x 	is a wasp southerner 
and if the fact were found that 'smith is a racist' then the conclusion 'smith is a wasp southerner' 
would he reached. however  if it is ian smith of rhodesia who is a racist  the conclusion would be in error  
　　　abs1 has no control over what people t e l l i t . if it acquires expectancy rules like 1  then it uses them in i t s reasoning. while its inference process is formally valid  it can come to empiri c a l l y incorrect conclusions because of the conceptual content of its facts and rules. such a situation has obvious implications for human reasoning. 
　　　thus far we have described the processes abs1 undertakes in replying to a question from an informant using only that informant's facts and rules. after abs-. has conversed with several 
persons  it contains l i s t s for each of them in its data base. when asked a question  abs1 f i r s t searches the l i s t s of the current informant. if a reply cannot be found or generated  a search is made of the l i s t s of each informant. facts from one informant can be combined with rules of another to yield a conclusion. if informants have input contradictory expressions  both are used in the reply. an input fact is considered stronger than one inferred from rules and  as mentioned  a more recently received fact is considered more representative than an earlier fact from an informant. 
questiontime 
during the conversational phase of talktime  
abs1  intakes statements and rules and replies to 
questions. when an informant has finished what he wants to say  he types the word 'done' which initiates a phase in which he in turn is asked some questions. 
　　　abs-  searches the statement l i s t of the informant looking for statements in which the subjectaffirmative reply is received  abs   stores the rule: 
'x is a baseball player implies x is a man' with any received modal operator. 
if the reply from the informant is 'no'  a second question involving a negation is asked. in this case it would be: does being a baseball player imply not being a man ' if an affirmative is received  the negation containing rule is saved. if the reply is 'no'  the rule is discarded. the asymmetry between affirmation and denial stems from the obvious but little-honored ambiguity of 'no' in human communication. when a human denies some expression it is d i f f i c u l t to know whether he is referring to a negation or the complement of a set. 
　　　since the data base l i s t s are temporally ordered s lo  might be found before s 1   hence the converse questions would have been asked f i r s t . both questions ore asked in order to pick up any possible relations between the two modifier fields. 
　　　the number of questions asked an informantcan be quite large and humans tend to find answering tedious. hence one can stop the rule questions at any time by typing 'quit'. on receiving tne latter symbol  abs1 attempts to engage the informant in a 
process of categorizing his concepts. there are six domains of interest or semantic categories abs1 is interested in - politics  religion  student dissent  race  persons and other  the latter meaning not belonging to one of the f i r s t five. subject and modifier fields arc searched for concepts  excluding variables  determiners  modals and prepositions  not already categorized in a domain. when one is found it is typed out and the informant is asked to assign the concept to one or more 
domains with which he judges it most concerned. also the informant is given an opportunity to recategorize a concept he previously categorized. as with questions the informant can bring an end to this mode of interaction by typing 'quit'. abs1 then enters a phase of processing called 'thinktime' in which it attempts to conclude new facts from what it has 
fields 1re identical but the modifier-fields d i f f e r . 
when such a pair is found  e.g.: 
thinktime 
	s 1  	'sam is a baseball player.'      s 1  'sam is a man.' the question is formed: 
 does being a baseball player imply being a man ' 
a check is made to see if the question has been asked before or whether the rule it refers to is already present. if not  the question is output to the informant who can reply with 'yes'  'certainly*  'probably'  'possibly' or 'no'. if an 　　　in the section on questions we described how abs1 can form a conclusion in response to a question from an informant. combining facts and rules from 
one or more informants  it undertakes chains of 
inference in order to reach a conclusion which 
satisfies the input question. during thinktime a similar process is carried out using a l l possible facts and rules. this is done after each conversation with each informant since new information 
can permit new conclusions to be reached. 
　　　hoping for c l a r i t y of exposition we have thus far described the operations of abs1 without referring -1-been told and to establish a credibility for not only the facts and rules it has received but also for the informant as a believable source of information. 
t o i t s c h i e f c h a r a c t e r i s t i c   namely  t h a t t h i s i s a b e l i e f system. a b e l i e f system  whether n a t u r a l l y o c c u r r i n g  as i n humans  o r a r t i f i c i a l   assigns c r e d i b i l i t y t o the p r o p o s i t i o n s i t holds and to sources of i n f o r m a t i o n . our main purpose in c o n s t r u c t i n g t h i s a r t i f a c t was to study these c r e d i b i l i t y processes in an a r t i f i c i a l system 
which i n t e r a c t e d w i t h humans. 
       in abs1  c r e d i b i l i t y is a weighted a d d i t i v e f u n c t i o n of foundation and consistency. the foundation of a p r o p o s i t i o n  p  is the weighted average o f the c r e d i b i l i t i e s o f b e l i e f s  bi  i n the system which imply the p r o p o s i t i o n  p  or 
i t s 	n e g a t i o n . 

the number of b e l i e f s considered is determined by a depth parameter which determines the amount of evidence in a r r i v i n g at the foundation f o r a b e l i e f . consistency is the converse of f o u n d a t i o n : 

the formula for c r e d i b i l i t y i s : 

where alpha is a weight relating the degree of importance between the c r e d i b i l i t y of a source and a particular b e l i e f   w is a weight represent i n g a degree of importance which foundation and consistency have in relation to one another. i n i t i a l l y alpha was set to the value 1 and w to 1. thus  for ab♀ i  the foundation for a b e l i e f is four times more important than the consistency. using various values for these para-
meters we can carry out ideal experiments in which only one variable at a time is manipulated and exact replication can be achieved. 
       in the formula for c r e d i b i l i t y pcred stands for a preliminary c r e d i b i l i t y . it is clear that f o r the a r t i f a c t to get off the gound it must have some i n i t i a l c r e d i b i l i t y assignments. to start it off we allowed abs   to assign a high c r e d i b i l i t y to the informant kmc and to everything he told it without examining this body of data for i t s degree of foundation or consistency. this situation is analogous to that of a human child 
who early in l i f e believes everything a parent t e l l s him. for sociogenetic transmission of information to occur it is necessary that a child be a credulous system  w i l l i n g to accept as true that which he recieves as testimony from authorities such as parents. in time a c h i l d may come to question these authorities when he receives contradictory information from peers  other authorities and from his own personal experience with the world. 
       to study the process of change in abs1 we began with kmc as a highly credible source and with his input in a l l domains of interest being accepted as strongly credible. each new informant is i n i t i a l l y given a global c r e d i b i l i t y and a domain c r e d i b i l i t y of 1  the bipolar scale of credi-
b i l i t y used is as follows: 

since these numbers r e a l l y represent rank orders they are rounded o f f at the end of numerical comp u t a t i o n s t o y i e l d the nearest value. i t i s t o be noted t h a t there is a greater distance between strong-medium than between medium-weak. a c r e d i -
b i l i t y value in the n e u t r a l range means the p r o p o s i t i o n is held t e m p o r a r i l y as a candidate f o r b e l i e f . a f t e r abs1 proceeds through the phase c a l l e d thinktime  there w i l l e x i s t n o c r e d i b i l i t i e s in the n e u t r a l range. abs1 s t r i v e s to p o l a r i z e i t s b e l i e f s and thus tends to avoid states of n e u t r a l i t y o r doubt. 
　　　during thinktime  abs1 attempts to e s t a b l i s h the c r e d i b i l i t y of the statements of informant 
w i t h whom it has most r e c e n t l y conversed. it f i r s t assigns a p r e l i m i n a r y c r e d i b i l i t y of each of the new statements based on the general c r e d i b i l i t y o f t h i s informant i n the semantic categories or domains to which the statement belongs. this 
becomes the pcred of e q   1   . 	it then looks at a l l 
relevant statements and rules which already have c r e d i b i l i t i e s to compute the foundation as in eq l  and consistency as in eq 1 . f i n a l l y it assigns a c r e d i b i l i t y to a statement according to e q   1   . 
       as has been described  d u r i n g talktime abs1 uses an inference process of combining statements and rules to r e p l y to questions whose answers cannot be found as already present statements. during thinktime  abs1 uses t h i s inference process to generate new statements. a l l possible conclusions are drawn using both a l e f t to r i g h t and r i g h t to l e f t inference process on the r u l e s . the statements concluded are assigned to the atom ' s e l f ' 
which is a member of the persons l i s t . thus ' s e l f ' is t r e a t e d as an informant l i k e any other and ' s e l f ' can converse w i t h abs1. the statements generated 
by ' s e l f ' in the inference process of thinktime are assigned c r e d i b i l i t i e s and ' s e l f i n t u r n receives global as w e l l as domain c r e d i b i l i t i e s . this type of selfhood has amusing consequences  such as f i n d i n g ' s e l f ' to be i n c r e d i b l e in some domains or .judging the statement ' s e l f is not a machine' to be c r e d i b l e . 
       the f i n a l procedures of t h i s phase involve a r e e v a l u a t i o n of the c r e d i b i l i t i e s of the most recent informant as a source and of ' s e l f ' . since informants tend to repeat themselves over time  the frequency of a statement or a r u l e is here used 

-1-

to compute the credibility of an informant in each of the domains of interest which in turn allows a new global credibility to be assigned to the informant. the same process is carried out on ' s e l f . abs1  does not then t r y to recompute credibilities of statements and rules from other informants. the potential circularities here are evident and must be avoided. 
discussion 
　　　we have described in detail an a r t i f i c i a l belief system  abs1  in the form of a computer program which attempts to perform the intelligent task of estimating the c r e d i b i l i t y of human sources of information. there are many uses for such a program. at the moment we are using it to study the problem of change in a belief system. given starting beliefs of high credibility from a highly credible i n i t i a l source  abs1 is being exposed to dialogues with other human sources who may agree or disagree with the i n i t i a l source. does abs1 change as a result of this experience and what is the change a function of  we shall answer these questions in a future report. 
summary 
　　　an a r t i f i c i a l belief system  abs1  capable of conducting dialogues with humans has been constructed. it intakes whatever information it receives  answers questions and establishes the c r e d i b i l i t y of the information as well as its human source. it is currently being used to study the 
problem of change and resistance to change in a 
belief system.
