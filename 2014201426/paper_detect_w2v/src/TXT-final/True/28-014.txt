in this paper we considered generalized rule-based updates in the framework of prioritized logic programs. we should mention that marek and truszcznski's rule-based update is embeddedable into our framework. for example  if our update rules only contain classical negations  
our formulation is reduced to przymusinski and turner's described in  przymusinski and turner  1 . 
¡¡finally  we have noticed that the issue of logic programs with preferences has also been explored recently by some other researchers  eg.  brewka  1  . in fact  we can further extend our prioritized logic programs by associating with dynamic preference so that our prioritized logic programs can be used as a more general tool in broad areas of knowledge representation and reasoning. a detailed comparison between our plps and others' work and other applications of plps in reasoning about change is beyond the scope of this paper and was represented in our full version manuscript  zhang and foo  1 .
