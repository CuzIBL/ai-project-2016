for this data. generation follows comprehension because generation cannot occur until comprehension learning adds words to the dictionary. length 
 of utterance inoreases because the number of words available to express a oonoept inoreases during comprension learning. knowledge of language meaning precedes knowledge of language syntax beoause syntax is indexed under word meanings and hence cannot be learned before the word meaning. misunderstanding of utterances whose correct interpretation is not the semantically most probable occurs beoause children use their knowledge or probable meanings to augment gape in their understanding. finally  misunderstanding of utterances whose syntax suggests an interpretation different from  the semantically most likely interpretation occurs beoause knowledge of syntax is learned after knowledge of meaning. this error is made when enough knowledge of aeaning has been acquired to produce an interpretation  but not enough syntax has been learned to produoe a correot interpretation. 
     there are certainly aany other factors in child language acquisition which have not been considered here  but this paper offers support for the seaantically-indexed syntax hypothesis and the comprehension-driven generation hypothesis as components of a complete model of child language acquisition. further research must address questions posed by the data of more advanced child language acquisition  which could support other methods of indexing syntactic knowledge and other possible 
relationships between comprehension and generation.
