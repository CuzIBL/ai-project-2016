1. introduction 
       in our generator  the semantic representations which constitute the inputs are based on the pragmatic knowledge with pertains to a given specific domain  in the style proposed by schank and his colleagues  schank 1 . the l i n g u i s t i c task domain investigated is that of t e r r o r i s t crimes as reported in newspapers. because the output of the generator is intended to be in the s t y l e of a newspaper  our generator is designed to produce well constructed t e x t s   not the kind of texts produced while speaking. our implemented program produces texts both in french and english. 
       first we w i l l examine how to choose a term to express a result   i . e .   a new state which arises because of one  or several  prior acts  schank and riesbeck 1 . this w i l l stand as an i l l u s t r a t i o n of how to express a single concept. then we w i l l explore how to combine clauses to express the concepts involved in the semantic representation of a complete story. this raises the issue of segmenting a conceptual representation into sentences. next we w i l l present our generator which is based on patterns of discourse structure r e f l e c t i n g the whole representation. 
1. choice of a term to express a concept 
　　　to generate a result  one might start by generating independently the new state and i t s cause  
and then connecting them by an e x p l i c i t causal f o r mulation  such as a clause introduced by because. with t h i s method  a representation where the result is dead and the act is an explosion would be generated as 
the icm president died yeateaday in paris because anaachiata exploded a bomb in his house. 
　　　however  t h i s text is far less satisfactory than one using the verb to bill and dropping because 
a word w r i t t e n in c a p i t a l l e t t e r s is a mnemonic name for a semantic or pragmatic notion. 
the icm paeaident was killed yeateaday in paris by anaachiatt who exploded a bomb in his houae. 
　　　a verb such as to k i l l is p a r t i c u l a r l y approp r i a t e for expressing the result dead because it means roughly cause to die . many verbs or verbal groups in french  as in english  have causal semant i c s similar to that of to k i l l in the sense that t h e i r subject causes a new state to occur for t h e i r object. this is the case for various verbs such as to penturb  to diacourage  to cut  to cook  to pack and compounds such as to give a hangover  to put 
i n t o verse  etc. adopting the p r i n c i p l e that it is better to express oneself as compactly as possible  the f i r s t attempt to generate a result must be to look for a verbal expression with the appropriate 
causal semantics. let us examine which factors must be taken into account to choose such an expression. 
　　　the context in which the result occurs may be s i g n i f i c a n t . as an i l l u s t r a t i o n   consider the case 
of the result wounded. this result can be expressed for example by to wound or by to injuae. the choice between these two verbs depends upon the context  as shown in the following pair of sentences : 
john shot and 	 wounded injured mary 
a lightning bolt  *wounded + injured  mary 
the former one involving a crime  the l a t t e r one an accident. 
　　　the specific action which causes the result may also be relevant in determining which term best expresses the result. for example  in order to choose verbs such as to strangle 
a young woman woa strangle thia wo fining by a mentally-hi peaaon. 
the generation process must be aware of the specific act which caused the death of the young woman. 
　　　furthermore  the generation process must consider whether the actor is specified or not. as an i l l u s t r a t i o n   suppose t h a t   when the actor is spec i f i e d   the generator produces : 
anaachiata killed the. icm paeaident ... 
for result = dead on a target which is not famous 
 anarchists assassinated pope max 1 ... for result = dead on a target which is famous 
anaachiata blew up a police atation ... vea anarchistes ont fait exploser un commissariat de police ... 
for result = demolished and act = explosion 
*however  t h i s analysis remains controversial in the current l i t e r a t u r e . 

　　　now  consider the same cases but for stories in which the actor is not s p e c i f i e d . one solution may be to keep the same verbal expression as when the actor is s p e c i f i e d   but to use it in another 
'a 
　　the formation of a passive form depends f i r s t upon the form of the verbal group involved and i t s syntactic construction. for example  in french  the passive requires  roughly  a simple verb constructed with a direct o b j e c t * . the form and the construction of a verbal group cannot  of course  be predicted from a languaqe-free representation. furthermore  even if a verbal expression f i t s the syntactic cond i t i o n s required for the passive  the formation of the passive depends not only upon the specific verbal group involved but also upon i t s complements. the following p a i r s   taken from  gross 1   illustrate t h i s point : 

　　　the work done at the ladl by gross and his c o l leagues** has shown that there is no syntactic 
 transformation  that can be applied b l i n d l y   i . e .   without looking at which p a r t i c u l a r verb and complements are used. as a consequence  the generation process cannot employ a mechanical procedure such as : when the actor is not s p e c i f i e d   choose the same verbal expression as if the actor were specif i e d   and construct it in a passive form without an agent. nor is there any way to predict whether a verb can take only a human subject. therefore  the generation process must take into account whether the actor is specified or not in choosing a term to express a result. 
　　　the person or object involved in the result may also determine the choice of a term to express 
*as a consequence  a compound such as cannot be passivised. when the actor is not specif i e d / the verb exploser can be used : 

**see  among others   gross 1    boons et a l . 1    giry-schneider 1    negroni-peyre 1   danlos 1    meunier 1    salkoff 1 . 
	l. danlos 	1 
the result. recall that the result dead in a t e r r o r i s t crime context is usually expressed by to aaba&&♀natz if it concerns a famous t a r g e t . furthermore  the term for expressing a result may also depend on the number of targets involved. as an i l l u s t r a t i o n   consider the case of a t e r r o r i s t crime i n v o l ving two famous targets. if the results of the act for the two targets are i d e n t i c a l   one may generate the result for each target as if it were alone  and then coordinate the phrases obtained : 
but  for the case of one target dead and the other one wounded  t h i s method would y i e l d 
which is only appropriate for a story involving two d i f f e r e n t assassination attempts  for example  in two d i f f e r e n t places in paris. therefore  another formulation must be used  such as : 
       in conclusion  the factors relevant for choosing a term to express a result  i . e .   a state which concerns an object because of an act done by an actor  are the p a r t i c u l a r state  object  act and actor involved  in addition to the context in which t h i s result occurs. this s i t u a t i o n is not peculiar to the choice of a term to express a result. it seems l i k e l y t h a t   for each kind of concept  a l l the semantic roles concerned with that concept may be factors in choosing the best term to express i t . 
1. segmentation into sentences 
　　　we have seen that the choice of a term to express a result  and more generally any concept  requires us to look at numerous aspects of the semantic representation. this is also true for the problem of segmentation into sentences. 
　　　one factor a f f e c t i n g the generation of a person-terrorism story is the feature a r b i t r a r y / n o n a r b i t r a r y t a r g e t . a non-arbitrary target is a person s p e c i f i c a l l y aimed a t   while an a r b i t r a r y one has not been i n d i v i d u a l l y chosen but represents a type of target   e . g . b r i t i s h s o l d i e r s   policemen or right wing a c t i v i s t s   . when the target is not a r b i t r a r y   it seems appropriate to produce a text such as : 

where a sentence expressing the result is simply followed by a sentence expressing the act. however  in cases where the victims are a r b i t r a r y   it seems 
more appropriate to use a form such as : 
in which the sentence expressing the result occurs in the gerund form a f t e r the act sentence. but t h i s kind of segmentation for the a r b i t r a r y target case does not always produce satisfactory t e x t s . for example  if the act takes place in an ambush  the sentences produced by t h i s method seem clumsy : 

1 	l danlos 

the following kind of text reads better   

       furthermore  special procedures must he used when there are very few d e t a i l s about the act. for example  if the only information given about the act is the fact that it took place in an ambush or that it was a shooting  the generation must then be something l i k e : 

where the act is combined with the result in s u i t a ble formulations. 
1. our generation process 
　　　even the few examples mentioned here show that both phrase selection and sentence seqmentation are affected by many semantic factors 	present in the representation. in generating causal sequences  we claim that the generation process cannot be a procedure made up of the three followino steps : 
i. generate the act 
i i . generate the result 
i i i . combine the phrases obtained. 
       such a procedure would suppose that the generat i o n process can be based on local decisions  an assumption supported by  mcdonald 1  among others. but we have just shown that each of these operations requires many d i f f e r e n t tests about information scattered throughout the representation. thus the generation process cannot be based on a simple combinat i o n of purely local decisions about how to generate sub-parts of a semantic representation. it requires that the semantic representation be considered as a whole. therefore our generator is based on associations between the semantic representations for spec i f i c classes of situations and templates of sentences expressing what occurs in those s i t u a t i o n s . for example  the representation of a story in which t h e re is a non-arbitrary and non-famous target k i l l e d in an explosion  is associated with the template : 
target  passive  time geo 
 explosive location. 
while stories for which there is no information about the act except that it is a shooting are associated with templates such as : 
target  passive 
these templates indicate the e n t i r e segmentation i n to sentences of large representation structures with the terms needed to express the main concepts i n c l u ded. they r e f l e c t a discourse structure appropriate for the domain of t e r r o r i s t crimes as reported in 
newspapers. this accords with the assumption  supported by  mckeown 1  for example  that people have preconceived ideas about the means with which a part i c u l a r story can be expressed as well as about the ways in which these means can be integrated to form a  written  t e x t . from these templates  the generat o r produces english text in a f a i r l y s t r a i g h t f o r ward fashion  danlos 1 . 
our generation process does not operate by use of generation rules of a general nature. of course  our claim is not that there exist no general p r i n ciples of generation. for example  it is certain that one must not say something which has already been said or which is easily inferable from the previous phrases. put  f i r s t   the application of such abstract p r i n c i p l e s varies from one case to another under conditions which elude a l l formalization in the present state of knowledge. secondly  the generation of connected text must rely upon discourse structures. such structures are domain and task dependent. for example  there is no common point between the discourse structures used by mckeown 1 and ours. let us add that our discourse structures would not be s a t i s f a c t o r y   if they were to be used in a journal specialized in bomb explosions. f i n a l l y   a generation system must take into account the constraints presented by the words and t h e i r uses. these constraints cannot be predicted from a language-free representation. as an i l l u s t r a t i o n   compare : 

the clumsiness of  1  comes from a pragmatic f a c t   namely the difference of importance attached to an assassination and a spanking. it is possible to propose a qeneral p r i n c i p l e which forbids the coordination of concepts which d i f f e r too much in importance. such a p r i n c i p l e would enable us to avoid generating awkward sentences such as   1   . but the clumsiness of  1  - being interpreted as a single crime with two targets - comes from the uses of the words to assassinate and to wound. thus here the awkwardness cannot be predicted from a languagefree representation. the generator must be given the patterns of sentences where these verbs occur  and the situations that correspond to the patterns. 
　　　any generation from a conceptual representation must rely on associations between representations and  templates  of sentences. such templates  whatever the form with which they arc presented  are clearly necessary  if only to indicate the construct i o n of a verb  i . e .   to relate the semantic roles  actor  target  e t c .   to the complements of the verbs  subject  direct o b j e c t   i n d i r e c t object with i t s p r e p o s i t i o n   . however  our use of templates g i -
ves far more information than those which are used only for the purpose of indicating the r e l a t i o n between the semantic roles and the syntactic complements  cf. goldman 1  for example . this is j u s t i f i e d by the fact that the generation process of a connected text cannot be reduced to a simple combination of phrases expressing sub-parts of the representation.
