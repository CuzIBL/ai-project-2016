 
　　　we describe a theory of natural language understanding within which we identify two separate components  a language centered1 one and a context centered one. xn1 rdrme* component uses a knowledge dase consisting of pairings of phrases with the concepts associated with them to determine the meaning of utterances. the l a t t e r component c l a r i f i e s the meaning found by the f i r s t one and makes it more specific by attempting to reconcile it with the context of the utterance. 
	we have 	constructed 	a 	program 	called 	phran 
 phrasal analyzer  which performs the task of the language centered component. 
1 	introduction 
　　　a recent tendency among some researchers in natural language processing has been towards a uniform  single stage process of understanding text. in such an understanding process  a l l the knowledge the system has is available for use at any time  and any existing routine may be run at any point. one version of this view has been called  by schank et al  1  and lebowitz  1    the integrated parser . 
　　at the root of this approach is the realization that previous attempts to process natural language in separate stages - f i r s t finding a syntactic arse and then using semantic information to etermine the meaning of an utterance - were in error. much research has been done in recent years demonstrating that semantic information is and should be used continually when processing text  and that it is wrong to assume that a separate syntactic parsing stage exists. but in arguing against the syntax-semantics distinction in processing  these natural language researchers have denied the existence of any discernible levels  or stages  in the process of understanding language and have 
argued that it is t o t a l l y uniform. 
　　　we claim that in fact there are two distinct levels of processing in the language understanding process: 

these two components together perform the task of understanding the language of the utterance. after these processes have done their job the f u l l range of knowledge we have available to us may be applied to the result. this f i n a l application of knowledge w i l l enable us to make inferences  etc.  in order to comprehend the input. 
  research sponsored by the office of naval research we w i l l describe our model briefly here  and w i l l then go over the separate components in more d e t a i l . a system called phran  phrasal analyzer  based on our view of the language centered component has been implemented  and w i l l be extensively described in most of the paper. an outline of some of the ideas behind context centered processing w i l l be given in section 1. 
1 	brief outline 
　　　according to our model  in understanding a text the language centered component reads the text  recognizes the words and phrasal patterns in i t   and produces conceptual fragments representing the meaning of the patterns plus other contextual information it may determine from its knowledge of the language. these fragments are accumulated in a buffer which is considered the context of the utterance. the context centered component looka at the conceptual fragments as they are introduced to this buffer and uses some world knowledge to introduce to it yet other related conceptualizations. it matches the appropriate fragments to slots that were l e f t empty by the language centered process  and it clarifies the meaning of some fragments in the manner described in section 1.  thereby forming more complete conceptualizations in the buffer. these conceptual fragments are then used to represent the complete meaning of the text the system is reading. context is also used by the language centered process when needed to resolve ambiguities. 
　　　in our model of language understanding  the language centered component has knowledge about the meaning of words  but in addition  much of the knowledge is about larger forms of utterances. this knowledge is stored in the form of pattern-concept pairs  where the pattern is a phrasal construct oi varying specificity  and the concept is a notation that represents the meaning of the phrase. together  this pair associates various forms of utterances with their meaning  and possibly with other aspects of the context in which they may appear. 
　　　the understanding process matches incoming utterances against known patterns and uses the concepts associated with the matched patterns to represent the meaning of the text. 
　　　phran  phrasal analyzer  is a system we have developed that models the language centered component of natural language understanding. it reoas english text and produces structures that represent i t s meaning  so that a context centered component may act upon them. as it reads an utterance  phran searches i t s knowledge base of pattern-concept pairs for patterns that best interpret the text. the concept portion of these pairs is then used to produce the meaning representation for the utterance. 
	phran is able to handle phrasal language 	units 
-- which are found with great frequency in ordinary speech and common natural language text - in the same manner that it handles the rest of the text. since control and representation are kept separate  it is quite simple to add new information to the system. all one needs to do to extend phran is add new pattern-concept pairs to the data-base. mike

       many n a t u r a l language processing systems assume that the meaning of utterances can be computed as a f u n c t i o n o f t h e i r c o n s t i t u e n t s   w i t h the c o n s t i t u e n t s assumed to be words. thus a l l the knowledge about the semantics of the language is s t o r e d   at the word l e v e l  birnbaum and s e l f r i d g e .

       for t h i s reason the language centered process needs to know more about the language than the meaning of words.

　　phran is a system which models the processing done by the language centered component w h i l e understanding english t e x t . phran i n t e g r a t e s both e n e r a t i v e and non-productive language a b i l i t i e s   t has knowledge about i n d i v i d u a l words combined w i t h knowledge about longer utterances of the english language. 
	here are some examples of sentences 	f o r 	which 
phran is able to produce conceptual fragments r e p r e s e n t i n g t h e i r meaning. these fragments should then be passed on to the b u f f e r upon which a system modeling the context centered process should act to r e c o n c i l e them w i t h the context and produce more complete c o n c e p t u a l i z a t i o n s . since no such system e x i s t s as y e t   phran has been extended to do some of i t s processing. the understanding of the f o l l o w i n g is done  t h e r e f o r e   e n t i r e l y by phran.

       phran is centered around a knowledge base of phrasal p a t t e r n s . these range from l i t e r a l s t r i n g s such as  by hook or by crook and in a j i f f y   through p a t t e r n s such as   v i c e   t i t l e     and   parent  in law   to most general phrases such as

  l o c a t i o n     . 
       associated w i t h each phrasal p a t t e r n is a conceptual template-. a conceptual template is a piece of meaning r e p r e s e n t a t i o n w i t h p o s s i b l e 
       references to pieces of the associated phrasal p a t t e r n . for example  the conceptual template associated w i t h the p a t t e r n  parent  in law denotes the  parent  of the spouse of the person i n v o l v e d ; and w i t h the phrasal p a t t e r n   person   go  to   l o c a t i o n     is associated a template denoting the movement of  person  from the place s/he was to   l o c a t i o n   . 
1 . 1 	how phran works 
1 	o v e r a l l 	algorithm 
　　phran is made up of three p a r t s - a database of p a t t e r n - c o n c e p t p a i r s   a set of comprehension r o u t i n e s   and a r o u t i n e which suggests a p p r o p r i a t e p a t t e r n - c o n c e p t p a i r s . phran takes as i n p u t english t e x t   and a s i t reads i t from l e f t t o r i g h t   i t compares the i n p u t against p a t t e r n s from the database. whenever a matching p a t t e r n is found  phran i n t e r p r e t s t h a t p a r t of the sentence t h a t matched the p a t t e r n as d e s c r i b i n g the concept associated w i t h the p a t t e r n in the pattern-concept a i r   and passes the r e s u l t i n g c o n c e p t u a l i z a t i o n s on o the b u f f e r where f u r t h e r processing w i l l be 
performed by the context centered l e v e l . 
1 . 1 . 1 	overview of processing -
　　when phran analyzes a sentence  it reads the words one at a t i m e   from l e f t to r i g h t . the p a t t e r n suggesting r o u t i n e determines if any new p a t t e r n s should be t r i e d   and phran checks a l l the new p a t t e r n s to see if they agree w i t h t h a t part of the sentence already analyzed  d i s c a r d i n g those that d o n ' t . a word's meaning is determined simply by i t s matching a p a t t e r n c o n s i s t i n g of t h a t l i t e r a l word. at t h i s p o i n t a term is formed w i t h the p r o p e r t i e s s p e c i f i e d in the conceptual template associated w i t h the word  and t h i s term is added to the b u f f e r phran uses. phran checks if the term it j u s t added to the l i s t completes or extends p a t t e r n s t h a t had already been p a r t i a l l y matched by the previous terms. if a a t t e r n is completely matched  the terms matching hat p a t t e r n are removed from phran's b u f f e r and a 
       new term  s p e c i f i e d by the concept p a r t of the a t t e r n - c o n c e p t p a i r   is formed and replaces the erms the p a t t e r n matched in i t s b u f f e r . in a d d i t i o n   an a p p r o p r i a t e conceptual fragment is passed on to tne b u f f e r on which the context centered process operates  f o r f u r t h e r processing. 
       when phran f i n i s h e s processing one word it reads the n e x t   i t e r a t i n g the procedure j u s t d e s c r i b e d   p e r i o d i c a l l y passing conceptual fragments to the context centered l e v e l of processing. 
1 . 1 . 1 	overview of phran patterns -
       a pattern-concept p a i r c o n s i s t s of a s p e c i f i c a t i o n of the phrasal u n i t   an associated concept  and some a d d i t i o n a l i n f o r m a t i o n about how the two are r e l a t e d . when phran i n s t a n t i a t e s a concept in i t s b u f f e r   it creates an item c a l l e d a 
       term t h a t includes the concept as w e l l as some a d d i t i o n a l i n f o r m a t i o n . 
       a p a t t e r n is a sequence of c o n d i t i o n s t h a t must hold t r u e f o r a sequence of terms. a p a t t e r n may s p e c i f y o p t i o n a l terms too  the place where these may appear.   and what e f f e c t   i f any  t h e i r appearance w i l l have on the p r o p e r t i e s of the term 
formed if the pattern is matched. for example  consider the following informal description of one of the patterns suggested by the mention of the verb 'to take' in certain contexts. 
{ pattern to recognise     f i r s t term: represents a person  
 second term: is an active form of take  
 third term: represents a physical object  optional part: 
 fourth term: the word from  
                     f i f t h term: represents a person  j term to form -
 ptrans  actor  first term    object  third term   
 from   f i f t h term if present. otherwise consult context    to  first term      
　　　notice that the fourth and f i f t h terms are marked as optional. if they are not present in the text  phran w i l l not f i l l the from slot  and the context centered process w i l l use the context to find the right slot f i l l e r . 
1.1 	simple example -
　　　the following is a highly simplified example of how 	phran 	processes the sentence 	john dropped out of high school : 
　　　first the word  john  is read.  john  matches the pattern consisting of the l i t e r a l john   and the concept associated with this pattern causes a term to he formed that represents a noun phrase and a particular male person named john. no other patterns are suggested. this term is added to 
 phran-buf1  the l i s t of terms phran keeps and in which it does i t s processing. so at this point 
*phran-buf* is 	  
   j1hn1 - person  npj   
　　　 dropped  is read next. it matches the l i t e r a l  dropped   and an appropriate term is formed. the pattern suggesting routine instructs phran to consider the basic pattern associated with the verb 'to drop'  which i s : . r -.   
	{   person   drop   object   	  . . .   } 
　　　its i n i t i a l condition is found to be 	satisfied by 	the 	f i r s t 	term 	in *phran-buf* - this fact is stored under that term so that succeeding ones 	w i l l be 	checked 	to see if this partial match continues. the term that was formed after reading 	dropped 	is now added to the l i s t . 	*phban-buf* 	is now   
   j1hn1 - person  np     drop - verb    
　　　phran now checks to see if the 	pattern 	stored under 	the f i r s t term matches the term just added to #phran-buf* too  and indeed it does. 	this new 	fact is now stored under the last term. 
　　　next the word  out  is read. the pattern suggestion mechanism is alerted by the occurrence of the verb drop followed by the word out   and it instructs phran to consider the pattern.  -
	t   person   drop   out   of   school   	  . . . j   
   the l i s t in *phran-buf* is checked against this attern to see if it matches i t s f i r s t two terms  t does  and this fact is stored under the second term. a term associated with out' is now added to 
*phran-buf*: 	. 
   j1hn1 - person  npj    drop - verb     out    
　　　the two patterns that have matched up to drop are checked to see if the new term extends them. this is true only for the second pattern  and this fact is stored under the next term. the pattern l person   drop   object j is discarded. 
　　　now the word  of  is read. 	a 	term 	is 	formed and 	added to 	*phran-buf*. 	the pattern that matched up to out is extended by of so this fact 	is 	stored under the fourth term. 
　　the word  high  is read and a term is formed and added to *phran-buf*. now the pattern that atched up to of is compared against high. it oesn t satisfy the next condition. phran reads 
1 
 school . and the pattern suggestion routine presents phran with two patterns: 
1 . |    high   school      representation denoting a 
school for 1th through 1th graders  j 
1. i   adjective   noun     representation denoting  noun modified by adjectivej | 
　　　both patterns are satisfied by the previous term and this fact is stored under i t . the new term is added to *phran-buf*  now: 
   j1hn1 - person  np   r dr1p - verb     outl  
 of     high - adj     school - school  noun    
　　　the two patterns are compared against the last term  and both are matched. the last two terms are removed from #phran-buf*  and the patterns under of are checked to determine which or the two possible meanings we have should be chosen. patterns are suggested such that the more specific ones appear f i r s t   so that the more specific interpretation w i l l be chosen if a l l patterns match equally well and if there is no possibility of further patterns being suggested tnat w i l l clarify matters. that is the case here since we have reached the end of the sentence. 
　　　a term is formed and added to #phran-buf#  which now contains 
   j1hn1 - person  npl .  drop - verb     out l  
 ofj    high-sch1 - school  npj   
　　　the pattern under of is checked against the last term in *phran-buf . phran finds a complete match  so a l l the matched terms are removed and replaced by the concept associated with this pattern. 
　　　 phran-buf* now contains this concept as the final result: 
     sschooling  student j1hn1   school high-sch1  nx . 
 termination premature       
1 pattern-concept pairs in some more detail 1.1 the pattern -
　　　the pattern portion of a pattern-concept pair consists of a sequence of predicates. these may take one of several forms: 
1. a word; which w i l l match only a term representing this exact word. 
1. a class name  in parentheses ; w i l l match any term representing a member of this class  e. g. * foqdr or   physical-object   . 
1. a pair  the f i r s t element of which is a property name and the second is a value; w i l l match any term having the required value of the . . property  e. g. 
  part-of-speech verb   . 
　　　in addition  we may negate a condition or specify that a conjunction or disjunction of several must hold. 
　　　the following is one of the patterns which may be suggested by the occurrence of the verb give in an utterance: v   . . . . v . 
  person   root give   person   physob   
1.1 	optional parts -
　　　to indicate the presence of optional terms  a l i s t of pattern concept-pairs is inserted into the pattern at the appropriate place. these pairs have as their f i r s t element a suo-pattern that w i l l match the optional terms. the second part describes how the new term to be formed if the main pattern is found should be modified to reflect the existence of 

the optional sub-pattern. 
　　　the concept corresponding to the optional part of a pattern is treated in a form slightly different from the way we treat regular concept parts of pattern-concept pairs. as usual  it consists of pairs of expressions. the f i r s t of each pair w i l l 1e placed as is at the end of the properties of the term to be formed  and the second w i l l be evaluated f i r s t and then placed on that l i s t . 
     for example  another pattern suggested when 'give is seen is the following: 
  person   rootgive   physob  
 to  opt-val & cd-form      
　　　the terms of this pattern describe a person  the verb give  and then some physical object. the last term describes the optional terms  consisting of the word to followed by a person description. associated with this pattern is a concept part that specifies what to do with the optional part if it is there. here it specifies that the second term in the optional pattern should f i l l in the to slot in the conceptualization associated with the whole pattern. 
1.1 	the concept -
　　　when a pattern is matched. phran removes the terms that match it from *phran-buf* and replaces them with a new term  as defined by the second part of the pattern-concept pair. for example  here is a pattern-concept pair that may be suggested when the verb eat is encountered: 
	   person   root eat      food   	. . 
 food  opt-val 1 cd-form      
	 p-o-s 'sentence 	  	. 	. 	nx 
cd-form ' ingest  actor  actor   object  f1d   
actor  value 1 cd-form  
food '  find*  food     
　　　.the concept portion of this pair describes a 
　　　term covering an entire sentence  and whose meaning is the action of ingesting some food  schank  1 . the next two descriptors specify how to f i l l in variable parts of tnis action. the expression  value n prop  specifies the 'prop' property of the n'th term in the matched sequence of the pattern  not counting optional terms . opt-val does the same thing with regards to a matched optional 1ub-pattern. thus the concept description above specifies that the actor of the action is to be the term matching the f i r s t condition. the object eaten 
w i l l be the term corresponding to the optional pattern if it is founa  or else it w i l l be determined by the context centered process from context. 
1 	pattern manipulation in more detail 
1.1 	reading a word -
　　　when a word is read phran compares the patterns offered by the pattern suggesting routine with the l i s t *phran-buf* in the manner described in the example in section 1.1. it discards those patterns that conflict with the information already in i t . then phran tries to determine which meaning of the word to choose  using the active patterns  those that have matched up to the point where phran has read;. it checks if there is a particular meaning that w i l l match the next slot in some pattern or  if no such definition exists  if there is a meaning that might be the beginning of a sequence of terms whose meaning  as determined via a pattern-concept pair  w i l l satisfy the next slot in one of the active patterns. if this is the case  that meaning of the word is chosen. if not enough information is available to f a c i l i t a t e a decision  a l l meanings are recorded with the hope that a pattern suggested at a later point w i l l make a 
　　　choice possible then. 
1 
　　　in principle  of course  the context centered level should be able to help in such situations  using the context. 
　　　a new term is formed and is both passed the buffer of the context centered level and recorded in  phran-buf*. if it satisfies the next condition in one of the active patterns  the appropriate pattern is moved to the pattern-list of the new term. if the next condition in the pattern indicates that the term specified is optional  then phran checks for these optional terms  and if it is convinced that they are not present  it checks to see if the new term satisfies the condition following the optional ones in the pattern. 
1.1 	a pattern is matched 	-
　　　when a pattern has been matched completely  phran continues checking a l l the other patterns on the pattern-list. when it has finished  phran w i l l take the longest pattern that was matched and w i l l consider the concept of i t s pattern-concept pair to be the meaning of the sequence. if there are several patterns of the same length that were matched phran w i l l group a l l their meanings together. 
　　　new patterns are suggested and a disambiguation process follows  exactly as in the case of a new word being read  with the resulting meaning s  being passed to the context centered process. 
　　　for example  the words  the big apple   when recognized  w i l l have two possible meanings; one being a large f r u i t   the other being new york city. phran w i l l check the patterns active at that time to determine if one of tnese two meanings satisfies the next condition in one of the patterns and if so  that meaning w i l l be chosen. otherwise  both meanings w i l l be entertained u n t i l future information confirms one of them. 
1.1 	possible extension of a pattern -
　　　it sometimes happens that we have two patterns where the smaller one ends before the longer one. 
for example  consider 	%   	v 	n 
   person   root sit   event  out   
                    person   root sit     when phran reads the sentence  jane sat the  game out . in this case  upon analyzing the word sit . phran realizes that the second pattern has matched completely  but it is also aware of the fact that there exists a pattern which has matched up to the same point ana which also may be present in the text. since phran is intended to matcn the longest pattern possible  it w i l l not treat the shorter pattern as matched yet. phran w i l l continue reading and analyzing the text u n t i l either the longer pattern is found to be present  in which case it w i l l be used to find the meaning of the sentence  or u n t i l the longer pattern f a i l s and phran concludes that it is not present. in the l a t t e r case phran w i l l back up 1ha consider the shorter pattern matched. 
1 	indexing and pattern suggestion 
　　　retrieving the phrasal pattern matching a particular utterance from phran's knowledge base is an important problem that we have not yet solved to our complete satisfaction. we find some consolation in the fact that the problem of indexing a large data base is a necessary and familiar problem for a l l knowledge based systems. 
　　　in the current version we index the pattern-concept pairs of the database in a tree. as words are read  the pattern suggesting mechanism travels down this tree  choosing branches according to the meanings of the words. it suggests to phran the patterns found at the nodes at which it has arrived. this l i s t of nodes is remembered  and when the next word is read the routine continues to branch from them  in addition to starting from the root. in practice  the number of nodes in the l i s t is small. 

　　　for example  whenever a noun-phrase is followed by an active form of some verb  the node the suggesting routine arrives at in the tree instructs phkan to consider the simple declarative forms of the verb. the phrasal pattern that w i l l recognize the expression 'by and large  is found at the node reached only after seeing those three words consecutively. in this manner this pattern w i l l be suggested only when necessary. 
　　　the main problem with this scheme is that it does not lend i t s e l f well to allowing contextual cues to influence the choice of patterns phran should try. 
1 	context centered processing and reconciliation 
1 the context  and reconciling conceptual fragments with it 
　　　consider 	the 	well 	known 	example 	of disambiguation: 
 1  the old man's glasses were f i l l e d with sherry. 
when 	most 	people 	read 	this 	sentence  	the 	word 
 glasses  is interpreted as meaning  eye-glasses   as opposed to  drinking glasses . this decision is basea on the fact that the mention of  the old man  activates some knowledge concerning older people and their normal physical appearance. 
　　　the d i f f i c u l t y people have with this sentence supports the claim that in understanding text people form a context  which includes the concepts appearing up to the point where they've read and related knowledge. upon processing future 
utterances and producing additional conceptual fragments  the understander attempts to reconcile these fragments - whether they describe objects or higher level concepts - with the context  we call this process reconciliation. 
　　　the existence of a context w i l l also help the understanding system in the processing of the following sentence: 
 1  mary cut the salami. 
here  reconciling the general notion of cutting with this particular context w i l l enable the system to realize that  among other things  the cutting was done with a knife  it was done in a direction perpendicular to the length of the salami  or at a slight angle to i t   and that the salami was probably peeled too. 
　　　on the other hand  when we hear mention of cutting in the context of a meal  the reconciliation process enables the system to realize that the instrument used was a knife  and that with the help of a fork the person doing the cutting separated bite sized pieces from the food and proceeded to ingest them. 
　　　in comparing the limited number of inferences that can oe made from a generalized concept of cutting to what can be understood from the rully specified one the system arrives at after reconciling it with the context  we see the u t i l i t y of this process to the natural language understander. 
1 	the context centered process 
　　　in view of the previous discussion we have decided to include in our model of natural language understanding another component  the context centered component. this component  atteinjpts ♀1  reconcile conceptual fragments wnich are introduced to the buffer with what is already known about the context of the utterance. 
　　　no program has yet been written implementing this component of our model. however  we can at this point state in general terms what it is expected to do: 
	1. 	add recognized concepts to the context. 
recall related concepts from memory and add them to context  making use of other routines . 
1. whenever adding a concept to context  check if context requires a particular interpretation of i t .  thus resolving some ambiguities that the language centered level is unable to resolve by i t s e l f .   
1. determine references  based 	on 	the 	known context . 
　　　in performing its task the context centered process makes use of the context of the utterance as previously recognized. in determining references  for instance  it w i l l not be able to resolve a reference if the thing refered to has not been previously introduced to the context. 
　　　unlike the knowledge base used by the language centered process  much of the knowledge used at this stage is not relevant only to understanding ideas communicated to us. we apply here  among other thing1  the same knowledge we might use in orofer to understand someone's observed actions  or to plan our own. for example  the knowledge about cutting salami used to understand the sentence dealt with earlier may be helpful when we decide to serve some to friends  or when we are trying to figure out what someone is doing when we see them benaing over a salami with a sharp knife in their hand. thus  the context centered component may call on other routines to supply it with further related conceptualizations - which w i l l contribute to the context of the utterances. 
　　　one should keep in mind that the two procenses described in this paper are constantly influencing each other. obviously  the language centered component supplies the context centered component witn fragments to work on; but there is interaction in the other direction too. as we have seen  fragments recognized by the language centered process may be used as constituents in further processing by i t . the context centered level  however  may add information to the fragment found by the previous level  and in this manner modify the meaning of any fragments of which this one is a part. in addition  tne information concerning the context  which is collected during context centered rocessing  is used  when necessary  to determine he appropriate meaning of a word or phrase the 
language centered component has found. 
1 	example 
　　　in order clarify some of the ideas described in the previous section  let us simulate the processing of the following story: 
it was duck hunting season. 
mary went hunting. 
she aimed at a bird and pulled the trigger. she got the bird. 
　　　when the f i r s t sentence is processed by the language centered level  an appropriate conceptual fragment is produced  namely one representing the fact that the time of year described was that during 
which one could hunt ducks. when the context centered process sees that duck hunting is mentioned  it consults memory about ducks and about hunting them. it adds to the context  in addition to the fragment representing the f i r s t statement  conceptualizations representing: prototypical knowledge about ducks  knowledge about hunting  and in particular  
f
uns and how they are used  e. g. representations or aiming and shooting j  
and perhaps others  the precise conceptualizations introduced to context w i l l be a function of how 
memory is organized: cf. mops in schank. 1 . among the conceptualizations added there w i l l be one of the form  shunt  hunter  y   object duck    with some indication that it has not yet been seen in the text. this fragment w i l l be of use later.
