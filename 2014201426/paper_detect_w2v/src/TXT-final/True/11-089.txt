　　　this panel deals with the r e l a t i o n ships between a r t i f i c i a l intelligence and pattern recognition. it addresses such issues as: how do the f i e l d s d i f f e r   how should they relate to one another  in p a r t i c u l a r   does ai have anything to learn from pr  
　　　pattern recognition  c l a s s i c a l l y   i n volves the extraction of features and t h e i r subsequent analysis in feature space using s t a t i s t i c a l tools or clustering h e u r i s t i c s . there is certainly an i n t e r esting class of problems that can be approached in t h i s way  but for the problems of central interest in a . i .   the feature space idea seems inappropriate  leaving feature extraction as an area of useful overlap between the f i e l d s . 
　　　an alternative pattern recognition paradigm is that of syntactic analysis  in which patterns are hierarchically decomposed into subparts  and recognition of an unknown pattern is basically a parsing process  where the pattern is f i r s t segmented into primitive parts  and combinations of these parts are matched against the rules of a  pattern grammar . this approach is somewhat more powerful  since it deals with structural descriptions rather than with unstructured feature vectors. however  from an ai standpoint  syntactic analysis is of limited usefulness if it makes no provision for using semantic knowledge about the patterns being analyzed. 
　　　on the other hand  there is something very appealing in the classical ideas of pattern recognition. the search for gene r a l i t y has become unpopular l a t e l y in a i . this is not because generality is undesirable  but because it is so incredibly d i f f i c u l t to achieve. the ideas of pattern recognition provide uniform a l gorithms of great generality which require only changes in numerical values for t h e i r application to a new problem. it is worth considering how the paradigms of pattern recognition are relevant to achieving gene r a l i t y in areas such as image analysis. 
　　　it should also be pointed out that even in ai systems for tasks such as scene analysis  some use of pattern recognition methodologies is almost unavoidable. such systems need to segment images into p a r t s   j u s t as in syntactic pattern recognition; to measure geometrical and textural properties of the parts  and to identify or classify the parts on the basis of these properties just as in s t a t i s t i c a l pattern recognition. advances in segmentation  feature extraction  and c l a s s i f i c a t i o n techniques are being made by both schools; they have more in common than is sometimes realized. 
　　　ai is centrally concerned with theoretical issues  but it has used a variety of practical tasks  e . g .   in image and speech understanding  as test beds for studying machine perception. pattern recognition has also dealt extensively with these same tasks  but t r a d i t i o n a l l y   has studied d i f f e r e n t classes of inputs  taken from areas such as document reading  remote sensing  and medicine  rather than i n d u s t r i a l automat i o n . there are significant differences among these classes of scenes  but there are also many common problems. the overlap in applications is growing  and should lead to greater communication between the f i e l d s .
