 
     the word expert parser is a computer program that analyzes fragments of natural language text in order to extract their meaning in context. the construction of the program has led to the development of a l i n g u i s t i c theory based on notions orthogonal to those t r a d i t i o n a l l y found at the heart of such theories. word expert parsing explains the understanding of textual fragments containing highly idiosyncratic elements  such as idioms  collocations  cliches  and colligations  as well as lexical sequences that contain interesting structural phenomena. the theory perceives the individual word of language as the organizing unit for l i n g u i s t i c knowledge  and views understanding as consisting of lexical interactions among procedural word experts. this paper describes four classes of lexical interaction required to explain the understanding of sentences in context  idiosyncratic interaction  linguistic interaction  discourse interaction  and logical interaction. 
the paper purposely avoids programming details in order to focus on word expert parsing as l i n g u i s t i c theory. 
1. 	introduction 
     the word expert parser  uep  is a computer program that analyzes fragments of natural language text in order to extract their meaning in context. the system has been developed with particular attention paid to the wide variety of different meaning roles of words when appearing in combination with other words. the theoretical position advanced by uep about the nature of individual words is that words have no meaning per se  but rather  that fragments of lexical items mean something through t h e i r interrelationships. furthermore  the character of lexical relations runs the gamut from the simple direct knowledge that some word sequence represents some remembered concept  to the more analytical knowledge that particular kinds of lexical sequences often represent certain classes of conceptual notions. 
  the i n i t i a l research motivating the ideas described in this report was supported by grant nsg-1 from the national aeronautics and space administration to the university of maryland. during the writing of t h i s paper  the author was supported by a fulbright lectureship in a r t i f i c i a l intelligence at the university de paris  and computer f a c i l i t i e s were provided by the institut de recherche et coordination acoustlqua/musique. the support of nasa  the fulbright-hays program  and ircam are g r a t e f u l l y acknowledged.

     the evolution of this perspective started with the observation that the understanding of a particular fragment of text depends fundamentally on the disambiguation of the individual words composing i t . knowing the contextual meanings of the words is tantamount to understanding the meaning of the overall fragment. another way of saying the same thing  rieger  1  is that language interpretation can be ultimately viewed as a process of word sense discrimination. 
unfortunately  this perspective does not eliminate the classic problems of deciding the nature of a d i s t i n c t word sense  the difference between d i f f e r e n t usages  word senses  and idioms  and so f o r t h . the solution to these problems comes in realizing that the process of understanding the meaning of words in context does not require reference to those notions at a l l . the design of a 
parsing procedure based on determining the meaning roles of individual words in context has led to the drthogonal l i n g u i s t i c notions that are the subject of t h i s paper. 
     the organization of uep is founded on the b e l i e f that the grouping together of words to form meaningful sequences is an active process which succeeds only because of highly idiosyncratic application of lexical knowledge. that is  we fragment text and understand the meaning of the pieces because we know how the particular words involved interact with each other. 
     sometimes sequences of two or more words interact together to such an extent that they seem to behave as a single lexical item. linguists have labelled such sequences idioms. the notion to which this d e f i n i t i o n gives rise  however  causes several problems for l i n g u i s t i c theory. first of 
a l l   rarely does such a sequence hold together so t i g h t l y that it can be t r u l y treated theoretically as a single lexical item. secondly  rarely does such a sequence have a unique meaning. more often than not  the meaning of an idiomatic expression must be determined by disambiguation. the sequence must be analyzed in context and be treated by comprehension processes as being either  a  a cohesive whole with idiosyncratic meaning  or  b  a sequence having meaning through less specific language knowledge. there is no a priori way of knowing the meaning of the sequence to be the one or the other. 
     the notion of idiom f a l l s at one end of a 
     spectrum  an idealized end that i claim does not exist. lexical seauences can be more or less idiomatic  in the sense that the process interactions constituting the understanding of them includes greater or fewer idiosyncratic interactions. the uep way of looking at the most idiomatic sequences is that the special 
1 

interactions among the participating words take p r i o r i t y over any other potential interactions involving those words. the disambiguation of idiomatic expressions  i.e.  the understanding of the sequences as either idioms or non-idioms  to use the popular d i s t i n c t i o n     generally requires other process interactions besides the s t r i c t l y word-specific ones. the understanding of an idiom thus d i f f e r s insignificantly  from the perspective of uep theory  from comprehension of any other kind  according to whatever c l a s s i f i c a t i o n scheme  of lexical sequence. 
     the notion that a l l fragments of language are more or less idiomatic  while radical in some l i n g u i s t i c quarters  has been previously suggested. in his introductory textbook  aspects of language  dwight bolinger asks  whether everything we say may be in some degree idiomatic - that is  whether there are a f f i n i t i e s among words that continue to reflect the attachments the words had when we learned them  within larger groups   bolinger  1j. after working within what he calls  the prevailing reductionism   bolinger began to suggest a positive answer to his pedagogical question  choosing to take  an idiomatic rather than an analytical view   bolinger  1  of language. the contribution of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence in general  and of word expert parsing in particular  is to develop theory from this informal view. the notion of process  and of process interaction  allows us to begin to do just that. 
1. 	the uord expert parser 
     the uep computer system maintains l i n g u i s t i c knowledge across a community of word-based structures called word experts  which represent the process of determining the contextual meaning and role of the individual words. a word expert must not be thought of as a representation for the various meanings  roles  and contributions of a word in context  but rather as a declarative representation  a network  of the process  which we shall call disambiguation  of determining these things. certainly  it is the meaning contributions of individual lexical items that we wish to determine. word experts are both data and process; they can be augmented  examined  and manipulated as data  yet parsing takes place through their interpretation as program by an expert evaluator  similar to the eval of lisp. 
     the d i s t r i b u t e d parsing scheme of uep works as follows. the uep reader examines a word of text and retrieves i t s word expert from memory. the word expert starts executing  trying to determine the meaning role of i t s word in context  i . e .   interacting with other word experts and with higher-order system processes to acquire the appropriate contextual knowledge to make the correct inferences. finally  a l l the word experts for a particular fragment of text come to mutual agreement on the meaning of the fragment  and the local distributed process terminates. local  in the sense that as long as there remains input text  the overall parsing process continues  while the disambiguation of individual lexical sequences making up the larger text completes. 
     interaction  between individuals in the world  or between distributed processes in a computer program  requires both  a  giving information and  b  receiving information. in uep  the experts exchange two kinds of information  called concept structures and control signals. concept structures represent human concepts  such as  a book    going fishing    the box of candy 1 gave joanie for valentine's day in 1    some blue physical object   and the l i k e . control signals represent processing clues  such as  expect a word that can begin a lexical sequence that can describe concept structure x    send me the concept structure representing the agent of concept structure y or a signal saying you cannot    wait a second and you w i l l be sent a concept structure that w i l l help you   and similar things. the representation and use of concepts and signals are described f u l l y in  small  1 . 
1  	lexical interactions 
     i use the term lexical interaction to denote the sending and receiving of control signals and concept structures by word experts in uep  this includes interactions between individual experts  
as well as those between a word expert and another kind of model process  e.g.  a mechanism inferring the goals of a dialogue participant . this paper discusses lexical interactions by presenting four classes of required interaction  and then arguing for the necessity and giving examples of each. the categorization is by the kind of knowledge exchanged in the communication  and includes the following. 
	idiosyncratic 	interaction 
	linguistic 	interaction 
discourse interaction logical interaction 
     the least general class of lexical interactions are considered idiosyncratic since they are word-specific and arise through simple recall memory. this type of interaction permits the understanding of idiomatic fragments. general knowledge about the syntax and semantics of some natural language gives rise to linguistic interactions  and are of course crucial to the understanding of lexical sequences not previously seen. sometimes words interact with processes that monitor the development of an entire text  or parts thereof   or the goals of participants in discussion. these discourse interactions are often necessary for the meaningful cohesion of lexical fragments. lastly  but certainly not least important are the logical interactions between words and the most general cognitive processes. perceptions about the world  beliefs  inference-making s k i l l s   rote memory  and so forth  
are basic to language understanding. 
     the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n of word fragments into categories such as  idiom    collocation     c o l l i g a t i o n      noun phrase    complement   and the l i k e   does not make sense in uep theory. rather  individual words are viewed as having certain kinds and sequences of interactions with their neighbors to form meaningful pieces of text. fragments often described as  idioms  are those that are understood p r i n c i p a l l y through idiosyncratic lexical interactions. a non-idiomatic structure  diagnosed as a  noun phrase   is one that involves mostly l i n g u i s t i c interactions to understand. a so-called  noun-noun pair  can be thought of as a lexical sequence comprehended with the help of logical interactions  with recourse to common sense memory 
and s k i l l s . 
1 	idiosyncratic interaction 
     since the emphasis of the uep research e f f o r t is to construct a computer program to understand natural language  we are not q u a l i f i e d to make claims about just how much of human parsing involves idiosyncratic lexical interaction. suffice it to say that no theory of language analysis can do without such a notion  and that we have come across many examples  both in our own work and in the l i n g u i s t i c l i t e r a t u r e   where it applies. furthermore  our conception of idiosyncratic interaction  in conjunction with the other interaction types   provides explanatory adequacy for many l i n g u i s t i c phenomena  observed in diverse camps. 
idioms 
     the comprehension of idioms requires both idiosyncratic lexical interactions and context-probing disambiguation   i . e .   interactions between lexical processes and higher-order memory processes . as an example  examine the following sentence  analyzed easily by the prototype wep system described in  small  1 . 
 1   the fellow throws in the towel.  
linguistic description of this sentence could take several d i f f e r e n t routes. the verb in the sentence could be seen to be either one of  a  throw   b  throw in  or  c  throw in the towel  depending on the theoretical perspective of the l i n g u i s t i c 
approach. while uep does not i t s e l f   e x p l i c i t l y   make use of the notion of a verb  if forced to explain i t s behavior in these terms  i would say that uep would consider the verb to be either  a    b   or  c   depending on the context. 
     the uep computer system would behave as follows. the word expert for throw would send a message to the in expert  consisting of both a 
     control sifinal and a concept structure. the signal would in effect t e l l 1n that throw would l i k e to pair .up with it to form a cohesive fragment. the accompanying concept structure would t e l l in what kind of lexical sequence  or conceptual mapping of one  throw would expect to find to the right of in for it to have confidence in such a pairing. of course  the in expert has independent control of i t s own interactions  and could decide  based on the nature of the input  to reject any suggestions it receives. in the above example  in would wait for a signal from the expert on i t s right  the the expert  indicating the formation of a cohesive fragment designating a towel  and then act on this information. 
     the concept structure sent by throw indicates that if the words to the r i g h t of in are the t o w e   then the words throw and in should pair up. however  the in expert has the prerogative to override this suggestion  and if query to the processes modelling the focus of discourse attention  see the later section on discourse interactions  determined that some large towel was the location of some active event  would do so  transmitting a signal to throw rejecting i t s advice. ordinarily  t h i s would not happen  and the in expert would signal acceptance to throw. the throw expert would then query the discourse processes monitoring the a c t i v i t y context to determine if  a  someone is actually throwing a towel into some volume  or  b  someone is conceding defeat to someone in a game. when t h i s was determined  the understanding of the fragment  in t h i s case a sentence  would be complete. 
collocation and colligation 
     what is the nature of the advice given by one word expert to another  as from the throw expert to the 1n expert above  and what is i t s basis  these suggestions  transmitted as control signals and concept structures in wep  are based on purely idiosyncratic c r i t e r i a . while the idiomatic meaning of certain lexical sequences cannot be predicted from the parts  certain others have meanings that d i f f e r s l i g h t l y from what might be inferred. these sequences are sometimes called collocations  and i l l u s t r a t e the idiosyncracy of lexical pairings and thus the basis for certain interactions in uep analysis. 
     in his recent paper  bolinger  quotes from t. f. mitchell  about the word work and i t s meaning in various fragments of lexical items:  men - specifically cement workers - work in cement works; others of different occupation work on works of art; others again  or both  perform good works. not only are good works performed but cement works are boilt and works of art produced  
   i t a l i c s in o r i g i n a l   . bolinger goes on to r e f l e c t why  builders do not produce a building or authors invent a novel . from the vantage point of the distributed lexical actors of uep  these p a r t i c u l a r i t i e s form the basis of the inter-expert communications we have been calling idiosyncratic interactions. 
     let us take mitchell's example  the ambiguous word work  and see how the word experts of uep can interact to determine i t s meaning in context. it should be easy to see from the discussion so far how uep would handle the following fragment. 
	 1  	 the ensemble intercontemporain performs a work.  
without knowing anything about the various e n t i t i e s mentioned in the sentence  it is clear that an ensemble of musicians played a musical piece. lexical interactions between the word expert for perform and that for work make clear the meaning of the fragment. the perform expert would signal to work i t s expectation of a lexical sequence denoting a conceptual entity that can be  performed   such as  a service    a musical piece   or  a series of actions . it would then be up to work to use this  non-binding  advice to contribute to the meaning of the overall fragment in which it participates. 
	1 linguistic 	interaction 
     the syntax and semantics of natural language comprise the stuff of most l i n g u i s t i c theory  and their use is the cornerstone of computer parsing programs. however  uep forces us to perceive the nature and use of this knowledge from an 
untraditional vantage point  that of the individual word and i t s active processing to form meaningful fragments of text with i t s neighbors. from this perspective  the syntax and semantics of a language is that body of knowledge that helps us infer enough about the meaning contributions of new words to understand lexical sequences completely 
d i f f e r e n t from ones that we have already seen. after processing some lexical sequence  this l i n g u i s t i c knowledge provides us with certain expectations about upcoming lexical items and the nature of their interactions  thus helping us to fragment those items into pieces and to infer the meaning of the pieces from general information about their component parts.

noun phrases 
     how can the purely l e x i c a l uep system require no notion of high order structural phenomena  yet s t i l l be able to account for them  the following example  provided by yorick w i l k s   i l l u s t r a t e s the l e x i c a l interactions required to analyze an interesting fragment of text. 
 1   joanie washes the colorful dishes up.  
the d i f f i c u l t y with t h i s fragment is in determining that the word dishes contributes to the meaning of the fragment through interactions with the two words to i t s l e f t   but that the word up contributes by association with the word washes  which precedes up by many intervening words. the reason that i am avoiding the use of t r a d i t i o n a l l i n g u i s t i c jargon for describing t h i s phenomenon is the following belief: an understanding of uep requires the viewing of language interpretation from the vantage point of the individual word and i t s interactions. an important way to achieve t h i s is to describe the analysis process with reference to the very notions  not the t r a d i t i o n a l ones  around which it is organized. 
     in the analysis of the example fragment  uep would f i n d the referent of joanie and then proceed as follows. the wash expert would begin executing  t r y i n g to determine i t s own meaning role in some l e x i c a l fragment  and at the same time  trying to provide information to other l e x i c a l agents to permit them to do the same. the meaning of wash in context depends on a number of factors  including the nature of the words succeeding i t   and their own actions in determining their meaning and role contributions in context. the wash expert must thus prepare for a number of contingencies  or 
d i f f e r e n t things that could happen in the text  and then  wait to see if any of them actually occur. if the word up appears to the r i g h t of wash  for example  the words could choose to pair up into a meaningful fragment  as in throw in above . under certain conditions  the word up could appear later on in the text  and s t i l l pair up with wash  as must occur for correct i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the example sentence . 
     what are the contextual conditions that would permit this  one of the contingencies that wash anticipates is the grouping of the words to i t s r i g h t into a meaningful fragment of their own   i . e .   a concept structure . the wash expert knows that  a  the nature of t h i s concept structure may be important for i t s own sense disambiguation  and  b  that the word immediately following the meaningful fragment could pair up with i t . in the jargon of uep  one of the experts in such a meaningful fragment reports a concept structure. since the up expert does not reply to dishes with an acceptable message to continue the ongoing concept building a c t i v i t y   the dishes expert reports the structure. it is t h i s report that triggers some new processing by the wash expert  namely the examination of the next word   i . e .   up . 
     the rest of the analysis takes place predictably. the wash expert interacts with up as if up occurred to i t s immediate r i g h t in the text. the pairing up of the two words results from mutual accord  and the wash expert creates a concept structure to represent the meaning of the washing up of dishes. next wash organizes the conceptual object  the co1orful dishes  into the overall meaning of the sentence  and again waits for things to happen. this time  the word expert for the period at the end of the sentence executes  and transmits an appropriate message. the wash expert again executes  cleans up i t s business  and reports the concept structure representing the meaning  in context  of the entire fragment  sentence . 
passives and relative clauses 
     sentences in the passive voice and those containing r e l a t i v e clauses are similar in being complex s t r u c t u r a l phenomena in natural language  and often suggestive of sentence-level rules as l i n g u i s t i c explanation. furthermore  the understanding of such constructions by the d i s t r i b u t e d word-based approach of wep may be far from evident  especially considering my claim that no e x p l i c i t notions of structure are referenced by the computer system or used in the theory. interpretation of textual fragments containing complex syntactic structures takes place through complex patterns of l e x i c a l interactions among the appropriate word experts. the words that normally cue a reader about the presence of such structural relations in a fragment are the ones in wep that coordinate the process of understanding them. 
     the analysis of a passive sentence involves l i n g u i s t i c interactions among the word experts for the s u f f i x en  the word by  and the other words composing i t . the following sentence has been parsed by the existing uep system  and discussed at length in  small  1 . 
 1   the case was thrown out by federal c o u r t .   
the en expert begins executing before throw  and the normal attempts by the throw expert to coordinate the analysis of the fragment in which it participates are intercepted by an. the actions of en allow throw to pair up with out. as outlined above for throw in and wash up  but i t s l e x i c a l interactions to determine the nature of the object being  thrown out   and the agent doing the  throwing  are a l l intercepted by the en expert  which provides throw with the correct replies to i t s queries. please refer to  small  1  and  small  1  for a f u l l e r discussion. 
     relative clauses beginning with the word who are analyzed by uep through the interactions among the who word expert and the experts for the other words in the clause and the larger fragment containing i t . the following sentence is an example of such a fragment. 
 1   the man who throws the game l i k e s to l o s e .   
the who expert in t h i s sentence has the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for interacting with the word expert for likes to inform tikes about the man doing the   l i k i n g   . ordinarily  t h i s expert would expect to f i n d a meaningful l e x i c a l sequence to i t s l e f t representing the needed concept. however  the p a r t i c u l a r structure of the fragment means that who must be at the other end of the relevant l i n g u i s t i c interactions of likes  rather than the expert for the word to i t s immediate l e f t   which would normally perform the needed service. 
     the uep interpretation of the example fragment proceeds as follows. the word experts for the and man agree to form a meaningful sequence and construct a concept structure to represent i t s meaning. the who expert begins executing  gets hold of t h i s concept  and waits for the throw expert to s t a r t exploring the nature of the l e x i c a l sequence on i t s l e f t . in addition  the who expert anticipates that another word expert further down the l i n e  in the example  the expert for 1/ces  w i l l also seek out information about the sequence to i t s l e f t   in exactly the way that throw does. the who expert  l i k e every word expert in uep  plans a strategy to interact with the experts involved in both i t s prior context and i t s subsequent context  cooperatively to interpret fragments of text. 
     the throw expert begins executing and investigates the nature of the lexical sequence to i t s l e f t . the who expert provides the appropriate information  i . e .   the concept structure representing the men  and throw begins to disambiguate i t s meaning in context. the experts for a and game mutually agree on their local meaning  and through l i n g u i s t i c and idiosyncratic interactions with throw help it determine i t s meaning as the  throwing of a contest . the likes expert starts executing  and i t s messages in search of the person doing the   l i k i n g   are intercepted by the who expert  which has been on the lookout for such interactions since the beginning. since the who expert knows the unique name of the concept structure representing the man  it sends this concept to likes  which proceeds normally  knowing nothing of the structural complexities preceeding i t . 
     the word experts for both throw and for likes can be expected to explore the underlying meaning of the lexical sequences preceding them. note the way that uep applies this l i n g u i s t i c knowledge to the interpretation of fragments of natural language text containing these words. rather than saying that throw and ukes act as f i n i t e verbs in certain contexts  which are described in some relational representational scheme  such as grammar rules or logic   we say instead that these words carry on l i n g u i s t i c interactions with the active processes modelling the other words making up the  local l i n g u i s t i c   context to arrive at a mutually acceptable characterization of their individual contributions to textual meaning. the advantage of this perspective comes from the fact that l i n g u i s t i c interactions constitute but a portion of a l l possible lexical interactions that represent in uep the process of understanding. 
1 discourse interactions 
     while it is clear that certain lexical sequences cannot be understood solely through recourse to syntax and semantics  namely those fragments for which idiosyncratic interactions are required   i . e .   specific remembered contexts   why do we need other kinds of general knowledge  we have already seen examples suggesting the answer to this question. in trying to understand the meaning of throw 1n the towel  the relevant word experts must f i n d out some things about the person performing the described action  before knowing what action he is in effect performing. 
     if the discourse describes some sort of competition between two people  or teams   for example  throw in the towel could indicate a concession of defeat by one of them. the following fragment i l l u s t r a t e s such a contextual situation. 
 1   rick and joanle play chess. rick throws in the towel.  
on the other hand  if the discourse has recently made reference to a place where one might dispose of a towel  throw 1n the towel might be signifying the putting of some towel in that place. the following example i l l u s t r a t e s t h i s case. 
 1   joanie drops a penny in the p i t . rick throws in the towel.  
i am not claiming that knowledge of 	the 	discourse context is sufficient to disambiguate the meanings of the example sentence  but rather  that such knowledge is required to understand i t . 
     the discourse interactions required to interpret the above example take place  a  between the throw expert and a higher order process modelling the activity context  and  b  between the 1n expert an a process modelling the discourse focus of attention.* there are two aspects to the processing of the a c t i v i t y mechanism  the unsolicited sending of control signals to indicate the anticipation of certain actions in the text and concept structures to represent them  and the more data-directed interactions with word experts  and other understanding processes  to determine the nature of the actions that actually do occur. the throw expert must carry on a c t i v i t y context interactions to determine if the discourse could be seen as discussing some competitive a c t i v i t y . if so  the  concession of defeat  interpretation of the example sentence is plausible. the in expert carries on rocus or attention interactions to find out if some location has recently been described in the text in which something might be thrown. 
     while the uep system has been directed toward the understanding of fragments of text occurring in textual discourse  the issues arising in the interpretation of dialogue are very similar. the difference between the two tasks involves the nature of discourse interactions. in interpreting fragments of dialogue from the vantage point of one of the participants  word experts must interact with model processes monitoring the goals of the other participant. the following example  provided by james allen  i l l u s t r a t e s the question. 
 1   when is the windsor train   
in trying to understand this question from the perspective of the person at the information desk of a t r a i n station  the question could be directed at e l i c i t i n g either of two pieces of information  allen  1   i . e .   the time of the next arrival from windsor  or the time of the next departure to windsor. 
	by 	saying 	that 	the 	windsor 	train 	is 	a 
 noun-noun pair   we get nowhere in trying to understand i t . in uep  the word experts for windsor and t r a i n would interact locally and determine the range of possible interpretations for the fragment. in the case of textual discourse  the train expert would carry on discourse interactions with the a c t i v i t y process to find out if discussion of some particular train were 
anticipated in the text. in the case of dialogue  these interactions would occur between train and an intention mechanism  which might determine that the speaker in the dialogue is concerned with the trains coming from windsor  and not with the trains leaving for windsor. if the processes modelling the a c t i v i t y context or the speaker intentions cannot provide help to the t r a i n expert  the word experts for the sequence would construct a concept structure to represent the disjunct of the two p o s s i b i l i t i e s   but continue to await the information that would decide between them. 
* the term activity context describes a notion similar to the scripts of schank and abelson  
and to the rrames of charniak . the notion of rocus or attention has been taken d i r e c t l y from 
	the work of grosz 	.

1 logical 	interactions 
     the understanding of fragments of natural language text by a particular individual  or computer program  often requires knowledge of the beliefs of that individual. how can this be true given the fact that  even when the discourse context has not been made to render a particular fragment unambiguous  the majority of readers s t i l l interpret it the same way  the answer l i e s in the common experience brought to understanding by readers from the same culture. this notion carries over to the common experiences of people in a l l sorts of sub-cultures as well  such as s c i e n t i f i c communities  religious groups  age and class groups  and so forth. there are pieces of text that would be understood in common by members of these groups and not by people outside these groups  and other fragments that would be understood in common by almost everyone. 
     a psychological experiment at stanford university  smith  lance  and shoben  1   described in the paper by bolinger  that i have made such extensive use of here  tested the meaning of various words in terms of class membership. subjects were asked to judge the truth or f a l s i t y of certain sentences  such as a robin 1s a bird and a chicken 1s a bird. the fact that it generally takes longer to judge the l a t t e r true than the former led the researchers to conclude that there are degrees of birdiness. clearly  
different people with different conceptions of notions l i k e birdiness would understand the same sentence in different ways. furthermore  the data of these psychologists  when interpreted in terms of language understanding  suggests that a lexical sequence could be viewed as representing  to a greater or lesser degree  some particular conceptual notion. 
     it is my belief that the understanding of many sequences of words takes place through a process of comparing new sequences to already interpreted ones. since the l i n g u i s t i c experience of each individual is different  language comprehension must necessarily take place in a person-specific manner. examine the following sentence for an example of what 1 mean. 
 1   joanie caucus throws a seminar.  
most people reading this sentence w i l l understand the notion of throwing a seminar by comparison with the other kinds of things they have 
  l i n g u i s t i c a l l y   seen thrown. when someone throws a party  for example  he is organizing a social event. when someone throws a chess match  he is losing the match on purpose. my claim is that by comparing throwing a seminar with other fragments involving throwing  people come up with the intended interpretation of the fragment. 
multiple choice perspectives 
     this notion of comparison with already known concepts is a fundamental method of interpretation in the word expert parser. individual word experts interact with a memory of real-world knowledge to determine whether certain conceptual notions can be perceived as other ones. the paradigm for these interactions is based on multiple choice - of a l l the fragments of text that have already been understood  the f i n i t e choice   which most closely resembles the one now being examined  for the example sentence above  the question in uep would be put f o r t h by the throw expert and would be some variation on the following  depending on the knowledge of throw stored in the throw word expert :  is a seminar better viewed as a party  a tantrum  a chess game  a legal case  or a baseball  .* 
     this type of logical interaction  interaction between a word expert and a process modelling beliefs about the world  has a fundamental role in uep language understanding. the queries l i k e the example are called  multiple choice  view interactions. it is important to note that these multiple choice queries often take place without including a  none of the above  option. the understanding process must be directed toward the goal of providing some interpretation on each portion of input text. this means that a reader must do the best that he can to understand i t   whether or not he has sufficient l i n g u i s t i c and cultural experience to come to the correct  intended  interpretation. sometimes we make mistakes. 
p l a u s i b i l i t y of propositions 
     the multiple choice view interactions allow word experts to use general knowledge about conceptual items in the world to understand fragments of natural language text. another kind of general knowledge concerns structures more complex than single items  namely relations among several such conceptual items. when we perceive such a relation as being convertible into some sort of t r u t h value  we call it a proposition. in uep  propositions may have truth values along a wide range  from something we might call completely disbelieved to the opposite extreme we could call completely believed. i say that propositions in uep work l i k e this not because of the existence of a computer program to operate on them  but rather  because such a program must exist for language understanding within the uep framework. 
     the reason involves one class of logical interactions  those between individual word experts 
and a process maintaining beliefs about the world. a word expert may interact with this belief modelling process to determine the relative plausibility of two propositions. consider the following sentences  both of which have been successfully interpreted by the existing uep system  with the user acting as the belief modelling process . 
 1   the man eating tiger growls.  
 1   the man eating spaghetti growls.  
the difference between these two fragments from the perspective of uep involves the relative plausibility of tigers that eat men and men who eat tigers in the f i r s t case  and of spaghetti that eat men and men who eat spaghetti in the second. of course  in certain contexts  the problem is resolved through discourse interactions; the a c t i v i t y context or focus of attention could make clear the appropriate meaning of the sentences without any need at a l l for more general knowledge. clearly  however  we can understand these fragments perfectly well without any guiding discourse context. 
  note the important effect such logical interactions have on motivating general inference processes in understanding. the augmentation of a real-world knowledge base depends on making appropriate inferences  and uep motivates these by forcing the system to find relationships between previously unrelated notions. for example  by asking to relate seminar and party  the parser instigates the construction of a new concept to represent  an organized a c t i v i t y of people'.

     the understanding of these fragments is coordinated in wep by the word expert for the a f f i x 1ng. the 1ng expert interacts l i n g u i s t i c a l l y with the experts for the words around i t   helping them form meaningful sequences  and carries on logical interactions with the belief modelling process to determine the relative p l a u s i b i l i t y of the two propositions possibly signified by the larger sequence. in the f i r s t case above  the ing expert begins executing after the and man have already started constructing a concept structure to represent the meaning of the man. it awaits the report of this concept structure  as well as the one to be reported by the tiger word expert. furthermore  1ng carries on l i n g u i s t i c interactions with eat to arrive cooperatively at a concept structure representing i t s meaning. the ing expert then has a plausibility interaction with the belief modeller  and coordinates the remainder of the understanding process based on this important knowledge. 
1. summary 
     word expert parsing is a l i n g u i s t i c theory based on a lexical organization of l i n g u i s t i c knowledge represented procedurally in word experts. the comprehension of fragments of natural language text is viewed as a process of word interactions  where active lexical agents cooperate to form meaningful sequences of interrelated lexical items. lexical interactions are of four types  idiosyncratic  linguistic  discourse  and logical. idiosyncratic interactions allow uep to explain the understanding of idiomatic  more or less idiomatic  lexical sequences  by comparing new sequences with e x p l i c i t l y remembered ones  called prerabs by bolinger  . linguistic interactions enable the use of syntactic and semantic generalizations to interpret fragments  and discourse interactions provide word experts with knowledge of discourse a c t i v i t i e s and foci of attention. logical interactions allow word experts to use knowledge about the real-world  especially about the multiple perspectives of individual conceptual objects within it and the relative p l a u s i b i l i t y of propositions about i t .
