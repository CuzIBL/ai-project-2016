       decision theory which belongs to the area o f a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e i s q u i c k l y developing. decision making is c l o s e l y r e l a t e d t o problem s o l v i n g   though these are not i d e n t i c a l processes. problem s o l v i n g i m p l i e s the search of means to achieve the c l e a r l y v i s i b l e goal which nevertheless cannot be a c h i e ved d i r e c t l y ; the d e c i s i o n process in general i m p l i e s the search of a l l possible means of achieving the bet o b j e c t i v e   preference comparison among them and choice of the best one. 
       the most important s p e c i f i c of decision-making problems is the presence of a decision-maker who has to act in the s i t u a t i o n which is characterized by lack of i n f o r m a t i o n about the e n v i r o n ment  about the possible outcomes of the decisions and about the values of some outcomes. i t i s not only t h a t o b j e c t i v e f u n c t i o n s  optimal c r i t e r i a   i n these problems are not s t a t e d but also t h e i r existence i s not i n d i s p u t a b l e . 
       the need to solve complex p r a c t i c a l problems and the i n t e r e s t to s c i e n t i f i c problems accompaning them led to quick development o f d e c i s i o n t h e o r y . i t i s 
very important that d e c i s i o n theory p o s t u l a t e s nonexistence of a d e c i s i o n t h a t could be considered the best one in any absolute sence  but only f o r a given d e c i s i o n maker in connection w i t h the set o b j e c t i v e . thus the two main problems of the d e c i s i o n theory are as f o l l o w s : 
　　　1  to substitute man in repeating routine decision problems  programmable problems ; 
　　　1  to help man in complex and uncertain situations to choose decisions consistent with his preference judgments using formalized models and methods which allow avoiding mistakes in long and complex chains of logical arguments  unprogrammable problems . 
　　　decision theory must provide the basis for development of models and methods whereby a l l the information on the problem  including the decision maker's preference judgements is used in order to decide which of the alternative courses of actions is the best. when decision problems are formalized d i f f i c u l t questions such as analysis of complex and uncertain situations become conceptually equivalent to simple problems that can be solved by  common sense . 
1 　　　presently it is universally acknowledged that in most important real l i f e decision problems the solution quality cannot be estimated by one scalar -valued performance criterion. here arises the problem of estimating and comparing alternatives taking into consideration a great number of c r i t e r i a  multicriteria or multiobjective decision problems 1j. themain difficulties in developing formalized decision methods which could be applied to a wide range of practical problems are caused by the fact that multiobjective decision problems are ill-structured   and in order to formalize them successfully one must consider a lot of factors such as sociological   psychological  measurement-theoretic  etc. disregard of these factors at the stage of formalizing the process of decision-making shows up as distrust on the part of the decision-makers of the results of formalized methods which are thus downgraded. 
　　　when stating and solving multiobjective problems it is essential to consider a great number of meanin-
gful circumstancies and ideas which cannot be easily given a strict mathematical motivation. another difficulty is in what criteria must be considered in a specific problem  whether all feasible solutions are considered  etc. these questions must be solved by all means and all of them are outside the mathematical formulation of the problem. at the same time working out the methods of choosing most preferable alternatives is impossible without using mathematical methods which are applied to formalized models rather than to real problems. thus in model approach to solving certain multiobjective problems meaningful considerations which cannot be strictly formalized have to co-exist with formalized methods and to be used in combination with them. it is only in interaction that they can lead to useful results. 
　　　the development and use of a model it possible to get ordered sets of feasible solutions  provided that the sets are consistent with the model used. at the same time it must be stressed that there is no  right  or  objective  model for any specific multiobjective problem. in connection with the fact that in each problem there is a great number of factors which may be taken into or left out of consideration  there always exists 
the possibility to present the same situation by different models. one can find whether these models are f i t or not only using them in real situations. 
　　　the process of developing multicriteria models in decision problems may be broken into the following series of stages: 1  goal formulation and problem type identification: 1  working out a feasible solutions set; 1  working out a criteria set; 1  criteria scale development; 1  mapping of feasible solutions set in the set of vector-valued estimates; 1  identification of a decisionmaker's preference judgments; 1  the decision rule construction. the specifics of the first six stages of constructing multicriteria models and means of their implementation are described in . we shall discuss in more detail the questions connected with constructing a decision rule. 
construction of decision rules 
　　　a number of various decision rules have been proposed  and each of them has some shortcomings which considerable limit the sphere of its possible application  1  . multicriteria problem analysis drives one to the conclusion that the construction of a generally applicable decision rule appears to be absolutely impossible. the following fact may account for i t . depending on the decision-makers goals his preference judgments and the set of assumptions 
used in the model  different decision rules may be constructed that naturally lead to different ordered sets of feasible solutions .. the impossibility of constructing a generally applicable decision rule requires development of a method for constructing decision rules leading to the needed result in every specific situation. 
1 　　　difficulties of finding out preference judgments of the decision-maker 
are responsible for the iterative nature of the decision rule construction procedure involving stage-wise acquisition of information about decision-maker's preference judgments  . information received at each stage must be used to construct an intermediate decision rule on the basis of which decisions are ordered. procedure of constructing the decision rule leading to the problem solution must be organized in such a way that the received sequence of intermediate decision rules has the following characteristics: the initial  weakest  one is based on the simplest and most evident assumptions; the following rules follow from the previous ones because we make extra assumptions that do not contradict the earlier ones and receive extra information. if an intermediate decision rule leads to the desired result it is accepted as the final and this is the end of the procedure  
basic principles 
       in spite of the fact that decision rules may be constructed in different ways depending on the problems at hand  one may formulate principal requirements that every iterative procedure of such a kind must meet: 
a  additional information on prefe-
rences  received by the researcher from the decision-maker at the i+1-th step of the procedure must allow establishment of the preference at least between two vector-valued estimates that cannot be compared at the i-th step  meaningfulness criterion of additional information  
b  the preference between any two 
vector-valued estimates received at i-th step must not change during the subsequent steps  consistency criterion of adopted assumptions and addittional i n formation  . 
       when comparing vector-valued estimates  the use of decision rule defines 
1 uniquely a binary relation  quasi-order in the general case  on the set y of vector-valued estimates and  thus  on the set of feasible solutions. 

　　　assertion 1 is needed to prove whether the information received from the decision-maker in practical situations is noncontradictory. 
　　　let the expression  denote the subset of vector-valued estimates corresponding to feasible solutions. definition 1. the subset 
information on decision maker's preferences 
　　　when organizing a decision rule generating procedure it is essential to define and substantiate a sequence in which different kinds of information on the decision-maker's preferences are received. thus it becomes necessary to make a classification of such information. reference  classifies the information in terms of its relation with one or several criteria. this approach makes it possible to distinguish three types of information: 
　　　1  information on the effect of estimates changes over one criterion scale on the decisions value  utility  in general. 
　　　1  information on the effect of 
estimates changes over one criterion scale in comparison with estimates changes over another 	criterion scale on the decisions value in general. 
       1  information on the effect of estimates changes over the scales of criteria belonging to one group in comparison with the estimates changes over the scales of criteria belonging to another group on decisions value in general; at the same time at least one of the compared groups must contain more than one scale. 
       information of each type is calssified with due regard to the degree of its effect on elimination of vectorvalued estimates incomparability. the sef of all possible combinations of the resultant ordered information classes may be presented as a flowchart which determines the sequence of obtaining different types information on decisionmaker's preference judgments. the classification suggested in  allows finding a decision rule for each type of information presented by the flowchart. 
application 
　　　　the suggested procedure of constructing the decision rule was applied to developing the method of isolating the needed amount of the most preferable versions of a mineshaft layout . when designing coal mines the number of feasible layout versions may be as high as tens of thousands. at the same time the mineshaft layout is such a complex plant that the number of its versions cannot be estimated by one scalar-valued performance criterion. on the basis of the detailed design examination which consumes much time no more than 1 versions may be studied. thus the selection of the best design version through a detailed design examination is to a great extent determined by the versions under study.

　　　the developed method for most preferable solutions search makes it possible at the early stages of designing: 
　　　- to work out a l l feasible layout versions for a wide range of mineralgeological factors on the basis of morphological analysis; 
　　　- to estimate a l l versions with respect to 1 nonanalytical technological and economic c r i t e r i a ; 
　　　- to compare a l l feasible versions and isolate from them the desired number of most preferable ones. 
　　　when developing the method the decision rule was constructed in three stages. at the f i r s t stage only information on different estimate preferences over each criterion scale was used; at the second stage extra information was received in terms of some criteria on the preference of estimates change over the scale of one of them from the best estimate to some other in comparison with similar estimates change over the scale of another criterion; at the third stage information on u t i l i t y changes relations corresponding to estimates changes both over one criterion scale and over some different criteria scales 
was received. 
　　　the method of search for the most preferable decisions was repeatedly applied to designing mines for certain coal deposits. in one problem the i n i t i a l set contained 1 feasible versions of the layout; from these 1 versions were chosen as most preferable. this subset contained layouts that had been disregarded earlier as well as those that had been usually included in the number of the best ones. 
　　　at the same time some versions which were traditionally used in designing were not included in the number of most preferable ones. the subsequent research and design examination f u l l y confirmed the wisdom of that selection. 
　　　analysis of the results of the methodology application to certain problems solution shows that it allows considerable saving of time and cost of design 
work and improvement of the quality of the decisions made. the methodology allows substitution of man in choosing the most preferable system versions at early stages of design.
