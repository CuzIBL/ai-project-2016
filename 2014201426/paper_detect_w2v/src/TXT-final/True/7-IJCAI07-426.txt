
although clustering is probably the most frequently used tool for data mining gene expression data  existing clustering approaches face at least one of the following problems in this domain: a huge number of variables  genes  as compared to the number of samples  high noise levels  the inability to naturally deal with overlapping clusters  the instability of the resulting clusters w.r.t. the initialization of the algorithm as well as the difficulty in clustering genes and samples simultaneously. in this paper we show that all of these problems can be elegantly dealt with by using nonnegative matrix factorizations to cluster genes and samples simultaneously while allowing for bicluster overlaps and by employing positive tensor factorization to perform a two-way meta-clustering of the biclusters produced in several different clustering runs  thereby addressing the above-mentioned instability . the application of our approach to a large lung cancer dataset proved computationally tractable and was able to recover the histological classification of the various cancer subtypes represented in the dataset. 

the recent advent of high-throughput experimental data  especially in molecular biology and genomics  poses new challenges to existing data mining tools. measuring the expression levels of virtually every gene of a given organism in a given state has become a routine procedure in many research labs worldwide and has also reached the commercial stage in the last decade. such gene chips  or microarrays  could in principle be used to determine the variation in gene expression profiles responsible for complex diseases  such as cancer. however  the large numbers of genes involved  up to a few tens of thousands  compared to the small number of samples  tens to a few hundreds   as well as the large experimental noise levels pose significant challenges to current data mining tools.
¡¡moreover  most currently used clustering algorithms produce non-overlapping clusters  which represents a serious limitation in this domain  since a gene is typically involved in several biological processes. in this paper we make the biologically plausible simplifying assumption that the overlap of influences  biological processes  is additive
¡¡x sg =c x  s  g | c                   1  where xsg is the expression level of gene g in data sample s  while x s g  c  is the expression level of g in s due to biological process c. we also assume that x s g  c  is multiplicatively decomposable into the expression level asc of the biological process  cluster  c in sample s and the membership degree scg of gene g in c:
	x s g |c  = asc  scg  	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	    1  
¡¡fuzzy k-means  bezdek  1  or nonnegative matrix factorization  nmf   lee and seung  1  could be used to produce potentially overlapping clusters  but these approaches are affected by the instability of the resulting clusters w.r.t. the initialization of the algorithm. this is not surprising if we adopt a unifying view of clustering as a constrained optimization problem  since the fitness landscape of such a complex problem may involve many different local minima into which the algorithm may get caught when started off from different initial states. although such an instability seems hard to avoid  we may be interested in the clusters that keep reappearing in the majority of the runs of the algorithm. this is related to the problem of combining multiple clustering systems  which is the unsupervised analog of the classifier combination problem but involves solving an additional so-called cluster correspondence problem  which amounts to finding the best matches between clusters generated in different runs. 
¡¡the cluster correspondence problem can also be cast as an unsupervised optimization problem  which can be solved by a meta-clustering algorithm. choosing an appropriate meta-clustering algorithm for dealing with this problem crucially depends on the precise notion of cluster correspondence.
¡¡since a very strict notion of perfect one-to-one correspondence between the clusters of each pair of clustering runs may be too tough to be realized in most practical cases  we could look for clusters that are most similar  although not necessarily identical  across all runs. this is closest to performing something similar to singlelinkage hierarchical clustering on the sets of clusters produced in the various clustering runs  with the additional constraint of allowing in each meta-cluster no more than a single cluster from each individual run. unfortunately  this constraint will render the meta-clustering algorithm highly unstable. thus  while trying to address the instability of  object-level  clustering using meta-level clustering  we end up with instability in the meta-clustering algorithm itself. therefore  a  softer  notion of cluster correspondence is needed. 
¡¡in a previous paper  badea  1   we have shown that a generalization of nmf called positive tensor factorization  welling and weber  1  is precisely the tool needed for meta-clustering  soft   potentially overlapping biclusters produced in different clustering runs by fuzzy k-means or nmf. here we demonstrate that this approach can be successfully used for biclustering a large lung cancer gene expression dataset. 

combining  1  and  1  leads to a reformulation of our clustering problem as a nonnegative factorization of the ns¡Áng  samples ¡Á genes  gene expression matrix x as a product of an ns¡Ánc  samples ¡Á clusters  matrix a and an nc¡Áng  clusters ¡Á genes  matrix s:
	x sg ¡Ö c asc   scg  	 	 	 	       	 	 	 	 	 	    1  
with the additional nonnegativity constraints:
	asc ¡Ý 1  scg ¡Ý 1. 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	    1  
 expression levels and membership degrees cannot be negative.  more formally  this can be cast as a constrained optimization problem: 
	x   a  s1sg  	 	    1  
s g
subject to the nonnegativity constraints  1   and could be solved using lee and seung's seminal nonnegative matrix factorization  nmf  algorithm  lee and seung  1   ¦Å is a small regularization parameter : 
nmf x  a1  s1  ¡ú  a s 
a ¡û a1  s ¡û s1  typically a1 s1 are initialized randomly  loop until convergence
 at   x 
	scg ¡û s	t	cg
cg  a   a s cg +¦Å
	asc ¡û asc	 x  stt  sc
 a s  s  sc +¦Å
¡¡as explained above  such a factorization can be viewed as a  soft  clustering algorithm allowing for overlapping clusters  since we may have several significant scg entries on a given column g of s  so a gene g may  belong  to several clusters c .
¡¡allowing for cluster overlap alleviates but does not completely eliminate the instability of clustering  since the optimization problem  1    1  is non-convex. in particular  the nmf algorithm produces different factorizations  biclusters   a i  s i   for different initializations  so meta-clustering the resulting  soft  clusters might be needed to obtain a more stable set of clusters. however  using a  hard  meta-clustering algorithm would once again entail an unwanted instability.
¡¡in this paper we use positive tensor factorization  ptf  as a  soft  meta-clustering approach able to deal with biclusters. this not only alleviates the instability of a  hard  meta-clustering algorithm  but also produces a  base  set of  bicluster prototypes   out of which all biclusters of all individual runs can be recomposed  despite the fact that they may not correspond to identically reoccurring clusters in all individual runs. 

we use nmf for object-level clustering and ptf for meta-clustering. this unified approach solves in an elegant manner both the clustering and the cluster correspondence problem. more precisely  we first run nmf as object-level clustering r times: 
¡¡x ¡Ö a i    s  i  i = 1 ...  r             1  where x is the gene expression matrix to be factorized  samples ¡Á genes   a i   samples ¡Á clusters  and s i   clusters ¡Á genes . 
¡¡to allow the comparison of membership degrees scg for different clusters c  we scale the rows of s i  to unit norm by taking advantage of the scaling invariance of the above factorization  1 : a ¡û a   d  s ¡û d 1  s  where d is a positive diagonal matrix with elements dc =  .
¡¡next  we perform meta-clustering of the resulting biclusters  a i   s i  . this is in contrast with as far as we know all existing meta-clustering approaches  which take only one dimension into account  either the object- or the sample dimension . although such one-way approaches work well in many cases  they will fail whenever two clusters correspond to very similar sets of genes  while differing along the sample dimension.
¡¡in the following  we show that a slight generalization of nmf  namely positive tensor factorization  ptf   welling and weber  1  can be successfully used to perform two-way meta-clustering  taking both the gene and the sample dimensions into account.
¡¡naively  one would be tempted to try clustering the biclusters instead of the gene clusters sc i    but this is practically infeasible in most real-life datasets because it involves factorizing a matrix of size r  nc ¡Á ns  ng. on closer inspection  however  it turns out that it is not necessary to construct this full-blown matrix - actually we are searching for a positive tensor factorization of this matrix 1
	asc i  nkc=1¦Áck i   ¦Âsk  ¦Ãkg  	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	    1  
the indices in  1  have the following domains: s - samples  g - genes  c - clusters  k - metaclusters. to simplify the notation  we merge the indices i and c into a single index  ic :
	as ic  kg  	 	 	 	 	 	  1'  
note that ¦Â and ¦Ã are the  unified  versions of a i  and s i  respectively. more precisely  the columns ¦Â k of ¦Â and the corresponding rows ¦Ãk  of ¦Ã  make up a base set of bicluster prototypes ¦Â k ¦Ãk  out of which all biclusters of all individual runs can be recomposed  while ¦Á encodes the  bi cluster-metacluster correspondence.
¡¡ideally  in case of a perfect one-to-one correspondence of biclusters across runs   we would expect the rows of ¦Á to contain a single significant entry ¦Á ic  m i c   so that each bicluster ac i    sc i  corresponds to a single bicluster prototype ¦Â m i c  ¦Ãm i c    where m i c  is a function of i and c :
	ac i  m i c    	 	 	 	 	 	    1  
additionally  each metacluster m should contain no more than a single bicluster from each run  i.e. there should be no significant entries ¦Á ic'  m and ¦Á ic   m with c'¡Ù c .
¡¡although it could be easily solved by a hard metaclustering algorithm  such an ideal cluster correspondence is only very seldom encountered in practice  mainly due to the instability of most clustering algorithms. thus  instead of such a perfect correspondence  1   we settle for a weaker one  1'  in which the rows of ¦Ácan contain several significant entries  so that all biclusters ac are recovered as combinations of bicluster prototypes ¦Â k ¦Ãk .
¡¡the nonnegativity constraints of ptf meta-clustering are essential both for allowing the interpretation of ¦Â k ¦Ãk. as bicluster prototypes  as well as for obtaining sparse factorizations.  in practice  the rows of ¦Átend to contain typically one or only very few significant entries. 
¡¡the factorization  1'  can be computed using the following multiplicative update rules: ¦Á¡û¦Á ¦Á    a¦Ât t ¦Â ¦Â       s ¦Ã ¦Ã ¦Ãt  t   
	¦Â¡û ¦Â  ¦Â   a¦Á  ¦Át  ¦Á    s   ¦Ã¦Ãt ¦Ã  t    	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	    1

minc ¦Á ¦Â ¦Ã  = 1	   asc i scg i 	nc	kg    1 s.t. ¦Á ¦Â ¦Ã¡Ý1.
	1 i c s g  	k=1	 
where ' ' and '  ' denote element-wise multiplication and division of matrices  while ' ' is ordinary matrix multiplication.
¡¡after convergence of the ptf update rules  we make the prototype gene clusters directly comparable to each other by normalizing the rows of ¦Ãto unit norm  as well as the columns of ¦Á such that i c¦Á ic k = r  r being the 
number of runs  and then run nmf initialized with  ¦Â ¦Ã  to produce the final factorization x ¡Ö a s.

before addressing real-world gene expression datasets  we evaluated our algorithm on synthetic datasets that match as closely as possible real microarray data. clusters were modelled using a hidden-variable graphical model  in which each hidden variable ac corresponds to the cluster of genes influenced by ac  clusters can overlap since an observable variable xg can be influenced by several hidden variables ac .
¡¡since real-world microarray data are log-normally distributed  we sampled the hidden variables from a log1normal distribution with parameters ¦Ì=1  ¦Ò=1  while the influence coefficients scg between hidden and observable variables were sampled from a uniform distribution over the interval  1 . finally  we added log1-normally distributed noise ¦Å with parameters ¦Ìnoise=1  ¦Ònoise=1. thus we generated our data using the model x = a s +¦Å.
¡¡we used nsamples=1  ngenes=1 and a number of genes  respectively samples  per cluster 1  respectively 1 . we compared 1 meta-clustering algorithms  fuzzy kmeans  nmf  ptf and the best run1  over 1 object-level nmf clustering runs.  other object level clustering methods perform very poorly and are not shown here .
¡¡figures 1 below present a comparison of the metaclustering algorithms w.r.t. the number of clusters  ranging from 1 to 1 . the figures depict average values over 1 separate runs of the whole algorithm  with different randomly generated clusters   as well as the associated sem  standard error of the mean  bars. note that although all algorithms produce quite low relative errors¦Årel =||x  a s ||/ ||x ||  under 1% 1  they behave quite differently when it comes to recovering the original clusters. in a certain way  the match of the recovered clusters with the original ones is more important than the relative error  see  badea  1  for the definition of the match between two sets of possibly overlapping clusters .
¡¡figure 1 shows that ptf consistently outperforms the other meta-clustering algorithms in terms of recovering the original clusters. note that since clusters were generated randomly  their overlap increases with their number  so it is increasingly difficult for the meta-clustering algorithm to discern between them  leading to a decreasing match.

figure 1. mean match versus number of clusters
¡¡this can be directly seen in figure 1  where we depict both the cluster overlaps  in the initial data  and the matches of the recovered clusters with the original ones. the inverse correlation between bicluster overlap and matches is obvious  pearson correlation -1 . 

figure 1. overlaps and matches are inversely correlated
¡¡among all object-level clustering algorithms tried  kmeans  fuzzy k-means and nmf   only nmf behaves consistently well. the conceptual elegance of the combination of nmf as object-level clustering and ptf as meta-clustering thus pays off in terms of performance. 

we applied our meta-clustering approach to a large lung cancer microarray dataset available from the meyerson lab at harvard. using hg-u1av1 affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays  bhattacharjee et al.  have measured mrna expression levels of 1 genes in 1 lung tumor samples  1 adenocarcinomas  1 squamous cell lung carcinomas  1 small cell lung cancers  1 pulmonary carcinoids  and 1 normal lung samples  1 samples in total . whereas the non-adeno classes are more or less well defined histologically  adenocarcinomas are very heterogeneous  with poorly defined histological and molecular level sub-classifications  despite the large variability in survival times and responsiveness to medication. therefore  we applied our algorithm to the full dataset and used the histological classification of the non-adeno samples  provided in the supplementary material to the original paper  as a gold standard for the evaluation of the biclustering results. 
¡¡to eliminate the bias towards genes with high expression values  the gene expression matrix was normalized by separate scalings of the genes to equalize their norms.1
¡¡although nonnegative factorizations have the advantage of obtaining sparse and easily interpretable decompositions  they cannot directly account for gene downregulation. to deal with gene down-regulation in the context of nmf  we extended the gene expression matrix 
with new  down-regulated genes  g' = pos mean gnormal    g  associated to the original genes g  where mean gnormal  is the average of the gene over the normal samples  while pos    is the heaviside step function. 
¡¡to avoid overfitting  we estimated the number of clusters nc as the number of dimensions around which the change in relative error d¦Å/dnc of the factorization of the real data  reaches from above  the change in relative error obtained for a randomized dataset  similar to  kim and tidor  1  . 
¡¡we then used our metaclustering algorithm to factorize the extended gene expression matrix x by running ptf over 1 nmf runs with the number of clusters determined above  nc=1 .  the matrix x has 1 rows  samples  and 1¡Á1 columns  extended genes .  figure 1 shows the resulting sample cluster matrix a. note that the algorithm has recovered the non-adeno sample clusters with high accuracy  despite the very large number of variables  genes   many of these potentially irrelevant in this problem. more precisely  the clusters 1  1  1 on the diagonal of a correspond to the classes 'squamous'  'small cell' and 'normal' respectively  while clusters 1 and 1 are two subtypes of carcinoids  which  like adenos  are heterogeneous and form two partially overlapping clusters . note that unlike most clustering methods  our approach allows for overlapping clusters. the accuracy of the sample cluster overlaps can be tested for example in the case of the samples ad1  ad1  ad1 and ad1  which were classified by histopathologists as adeno-squamous and also appear in the overlap of our 'squamous' cluster with other 'adeno' clusters. similarly  the overlap between the small cell and squamous sample clusters corresponds to mixed small cell-squamous cases  which are mentioned in the literature.

¡¡the gene clusters s recovered genes with well known involvement in the lung cancer subtypes under study. for example  the squamous cluster contained numerous keratin genes  keratins 1a  1  1  1  1  1  1   typical for squamous differentiation  the keratinocyte-specific protein stratifin  the p1 tumor suppressor analog tp1l  etc. more details on the gene clusters and a larger version 
of figure 1 can be found in the supplementary material at http://www.ai.ici.ro/ijcai1/.  note that genes with large 
scg tend to be differentially expressed between the classes  although the class information was never provided to the algorithm.

 1 11¡¡fuzzy k-means clustering required a very delicate finetuning of the fuzzy exponent for obtaining non-trivial clusters: we used a fuzzy exponent of 1  whereas a slightly higher value of 1 produced only trivial  noninformative clusters. however  such a small fuzzy exponent leads to very categorical membership degrees even for very small differences in distance between gene profiles  so the results are similar to those of hard clustering  plain k-means . this is probably due to the different interpretations of cluster overlap in fuzzy k-means and nmf respectively: whereas fuzzy k-means views overlaps in terms of membership degrees  nmf and ptf interpret overlaps as mixtures  as in the case of the adenosquamous samples - see also assumptions  1  and  1  above .
¡¡however  much more important than a small improvement in error is the stability of the resulting clusters. all studied methods recovered the non-adeno sample clusters satisfactorily  with differences in the adeno clusters that cannot be judged based on current histological evidence . to study the variability of the gene clusters s in different runs of each algorithm  we computed the average relative differences ||si sj||/||si|| between pairs of gene cluster matrices si obtained in 1 different runs  of each algorithm  for nc=1 clusters  as well as the corresponding mismatches between gene clusters matrices. we display the cluster mismatches for progressively larger cutoff thresholds1 to show that the differences between clusters obtained in different runs involve not just the small  but also the large coefficients of s.

 1 ¡¡as the inter-run variability of s is quite large for all clustering methods tried1  except ptf  e.g. 1% for nmf with nc=1   using such clustering algorithms for determining gene clusters is highly unreliable. on the other hand  ptf is preferable to the other methods due to its increased stability  only about 1% variability of s .
¡¡moreover  ptf is preferable to fuzzy k-means in clustering gene expression data since it is able to reconstruct gene profiles of samples that represent mixtures of frequently occurring profiles. for example  the meyerson dataset studied here contains numerous samples with expression profiles similar to a squamous profile sq  as well as other samples with a different  adeno profile ad  by a gene expression profile we mean a set of gene expression values for all genes represented on the microarray chip . these two different sample groups will lead to two distinct columns of a representing the sq and ad profiles. however  the meyerson dataset also contains adeno-squamous samples with a mixed ad + sq profile  which can be easily represented by nmf and ptf factorizations  but not by fuzzy or plain k-means. 

a detailed review of the clustering methods applicable to gene expression data is out of the scope of this paper  due to space constraints. briefly  our approach is significantly different from other biclustering approaches  such as cheng and church's  cheng and church  1   which is based on a simpler additive model that is not scale invariant  and thus problematic in the case of gene expression data . on the other hand  approaches based on singular value decompositions  or the iterative signature algorithm  bergmann et al.  1   tend to produce holistic decompositions as opposed to the more parts-based ones obtained here  holistic decompositions being typically hard to interpret in this domain . closest to our approach are  kim and tidor  1  and  brunet et al.  1 . kim and tidor  used nmf decompositions for analyzing a yeast gene expression compendium  but their approach still suffers from the instability of nmf. on the other hand  brunet et al.  used nmf for nonoverlapping iterative clustering of samples  rather than biclustering as we do.
¡¡in this paper we show that nonnegative decompositions such as nmf and ptf can be combined in a non-trivial way to obtain an improved meta-clustering algorithm for gene expression data. the approach deals with overlapping clusters and alleviates the annoying instability of currently used algorithms by using an advanced two-way meta-clustering technique based on tensor  rather than matrix  factorizations.
¡¡it is encouraging that ptf recovers the main known lung cancer subtypes  including subtle classifications of certain samples in overlapping classes  adeno-squamous   in a large dataset in which 1% of the samples represent the poorly characterized adenocarcinoma.
¡¡and although the improvements in error obtained by ptf are only marginal  it leads to increased stability of the gene clusters  which are extremely important for determining the genes causing the disease . moreover  ptf proves more adequate in this domain than other methods like fuzzy k-means  due to its interpretation of cluster overlaps as mixtures  fuzzy k-means being extremely sensitive to minute changes in the fuzzy exponent.
