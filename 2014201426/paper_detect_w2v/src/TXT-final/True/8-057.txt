　　　if a l l free variables in a molecule become appropriately fixed  the molecule ia successfully f i l l e d . the conditions of such success are apparently quite straightforward mathematically. dej o t ing the contents of the concrete molecule 
and this fixedness is transferred to the appropriate element of another sentence type in the same molecule. acceptable concrete sentences of this type are generated from the appropriate block of the belief l i s t b  thus fixing another free variable. at this point  one remaining sentence in the molecule typically has both x elements fixed  and the value of the ptrue function is calculated for i t . success either completes the molecule or  in case sentences remain in the molecule specification  new free variables are fixed by concrete sentence generation and/or the ptrue function is calculated for new fixed-variable sentences  
　　　the ptrue function involves one or two steps. the f i r s t is a matching procedure against the appropriate block of the b-list  looking for a known sentence with a l l elements  similar  to the tested sentenoe.   similar  is a more relaxed version of  highly similar   mentioned previously.  if this test f a i l s   a second procedure is undertaken  a procedure which lends ths whole routine much greater interest. 
　　　this procedure introduces recursion in ths molecule-filling routine. the second way in which the function ptrue can be satisfied for a sentence is by entering that sentence in turn as input to the f i l l i n g routine. a successful exit endows the sentence with presumptive t r u t h . the existence of this r e a l i s t i c program device means that the attempt to complete molecules assumes an open-ended character  with p a r t i a l completions leading to new searches which may have partial completions  and so on. there is undoubtedly a psychological l i m i t to the depth such a recursion might reasonably take  and a presently arbitrary program parameter is used to define this l i m i t . hopefully  empirical work now in progress w i l l shed light upon the appropriate value of this parameter. 
in order to make the foregoing abstract ex-
　　　
planation of the routine more concrete  table 1 gives some of the categories  elements  and molecules for the right-winger. the components shown of course represent only a small fraction of the t o t a l storage. notice that noun elements can bs compound concepts such as situations-helpful-tothe-communists. one of the molecules  the crucial one for present purposes  is labeled  no-win policy  by the system  and has the four argumentst liberals  western governments  situationa-helpfulto-the-communists  and standing-up-to-the-communists. the sentences of the molecule arei weetern governments promote situations-helpful-to-thecommunists} standing-up-to-the-communiats prevents situations-helpful-to-the-communists1 liberals control western governments; liberals fear standingup-tc-the- communists  
　　　now suppose that the input sentence is  britain not-interferes-with czech invasion.  the sentence type is  western governments promotes situations-helpful-to-the-communists.  the program consults i t s moleoule l i s t   and finds that ths no-win policy molecule contains a sentenoe of this

type. second molecule sentences are now generated by consulting the belief l i s t to locate sentences of the type   standing-up-to-the-communists prevanta situationa-helpful-to-the-cfcmmunists.  not a l l aantancaa of this typa are appropriate  however   since the specific sentence object muat be similar to the fixed variable of the f i r s t sentences czech invasions. thus   allied a i r l i f t overcomes berlin blockade  is not appropriate. a l i s t of candidate sentences is constructed  and we suppose that the f i r s t such sentence is  u.s. shows of force stops red invasions.  for the third sentence of the molecule  the required sentence type is  liberals control western governments.  here  the  western governments  variable is fixed by the input as  britain   but  liberals  is a 
free variable  because it has not occurred before . suppose  wilson controls britain1 is the only appropriate sentence of this third type. 
　　　passing finally to the fourth sentence of the molecule  we see that the type   liberals fear standing-up-to-the-communists  has been constrained by fixing the l i b e r a l as  wilson  and standing-upto-the-communists as  u.s. shows of force  or something similar. now the program instead of generating possibilities  must simply see if anything at a l l on the belief l i s t f i t s the specification. i f   say   wilson fears u.s. nuclear actions   is present  then the molecule is successfully f i l l e d . the output can now be constructed by chaining together the four realized sentences of this molecule  the name of the molecule   no-win policy  and suitable pre-keyed i n t e r s t i t i a l materi a l to produce a f l o r i d and smarmy account of why britain does not interfere with the czech invasion. 
　　　i f   on the other hand  the belief l i s t containa nothing to suggest that  wilson fears u.s. shows of force ! then this sentence i t s e l f is i n put to the fill-molecule routine. another molecule is found which w i l l accommodate a sentence of this typei say  the  liberal weakness  molecule -  liberals fear atanding-up-to-the-communists    liberals oppose armaments    armaments promote standing-up-to-the-communiets.  if the second and t h i r d sentences here can be realized  say with  wilson opposes british troop commitments  and  britiah troop commitments aid u.s. shows of force   then  wilson fears u.s. shows of force would be considered presumptively true by the program  thus f i l l i n g the original molecule. 
　　　failure of thia recursion leads to an i t e r ation down the earlier l i s t of candidate sentences in an attempt to find another suitable combination. exhaustion of a l l candidate l i s t s leads to abandonment of one molecule and attempts at f i l l i n g others  afterr which the f i n a l failure exit occurs. 
　　　with a program limitation on deep recursion  this routine usually takes no more than half a minute. 	of course this sstimate depends on the parameters of the particular memory  and we w i l l need more experience to derive more general estimates.
