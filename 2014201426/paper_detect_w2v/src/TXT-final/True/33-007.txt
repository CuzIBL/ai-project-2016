b. i d e n t i f i c a t i o n 
     searle  has claimed that the communicative act of  singular definite  referenoe involves uttering an expression d with the intention that the hearer pick out  or identify the referent of d. from the perspective of a plan-based theory  identifying a referent should be represented as an action in the speaker's plan. as such  it can be reasoned about just as any other act. for example  just as speakers can intend the means by which a hearer performs an action  they may expect and intend for hearers to identify a referent by performing some combination of sensory and cognitive  actions . a speaker uttering the description  the two salty red ones  may be expecting  and perhaps intending  for the hearer to count  look a t   and taste various objects. speakers design their expression d so that hearers can use d as a  blueprint  for the actions needed to identify the referent   i n the world . 
     many occurrences of descriptions in taskoriented conversations are not intended to be used in t h i s way. for example  in dialogues with an information booth clerk in a t r a i n station   1   1   patrons uttering  the 1 to montreal   are not intending the clerk to f i n d the t r a i n . instead  as part of their plan for boarding a t r a i n   patrons are intending the clerk to given them a coreferring noun phrase that w i l l allow them to i d e n t i f y the t r a i n . the a t t r i b u t i v e use of d e f i n i t e descriptions  is another case in which the speaker has no intention that the hearer i d e n t i f y a referent. 
     i d e n t i f i c a t i o n is essentially a search process  the act of searching for something that s a t i s f i e s the description. we can approximate i t s d e f i n i t i o n with the following: 
identify agt  d  	 where d is 	a description  
precondition: there is an object x perceptually accessible to act such that x is the referent of d. e f f e c t :  identified-ref agt d  means: some function mapping the description d to some procedure that when executed yields a  perhaps   direct representation  of the referent of d. that procedure may well incorporate the results of perceiving the world. 

     what la not clear  of course  la juat what agt has to know about d to say he haa identified i t . * to give a name to the state of knowledge one la in after having identified the referent of d  we w i l l use  identified-ref agt d . we shall only consider the  basic  case of i d e n t i f i c a t i o n through perception. 
c. the problem areas 
     there are  at least  six problem areas that need to be addressed. 
1. is there evidence for an identify act in speakers' and hearer's plans  
1. if so  why is it planned  
1. what advantages accrue from positing such actions  do they allow us to develop a uniform analysis for what would otherwise be unrelated phenomena  
1. what signals or communicates a speaker'a intention that a hearer identify the referent of a description  
1. when do speakers e x p l i c i t l y communicate the intention that their hearer i d e n t i f y a referent  
1. how is identify defined as an act  in what situations is it appropriate  what changes of  state  does it effect  by what means is it accomplished  
     this paper w i l l discuss problem areaa 1  1  and 1  and touch on problems 1 and 1  by presenting evidence from task-oriented dialoguea. we hope to show that an identify act  coupled with a planbased theory of speech acts w i l l provide a basis for extending our current a b i l i t y to model taskoriented dialogue. 
i i . evidence for an identify act 
　　　la there evidence for an identify act  the answer is a q u a l i f i e d  yes    n a t u r a l l y   . to the extent that philosophers  l i n g u i s t s   and ai researchers map action verba and the objects of imperatives onto underlying  acta   then we need one for identify. utterances such as  notice the two side outlets on the chamber   or   f i n d the rubber r i n g shaped l i k e an 1 .     which occurred in the transcripts  clearly indicate that the speaker intends the hearer to do something. the term  request  labels any action   l i n g u i s t i c or not  of the speaker that results in the hearer's thinking  for the   r i g h t   reasons  1  1  1  1   the speaker wants and intends him/her to do a particular action. earlier  we claimed that the speaker's plan contained an identify act  to be performed by the hearer  representing a physical search for an object satisfying the description. any action of the speaker'a that communicates the intention that the hearer i d e n t i f y the referent of a description w i l l be labelled a request to 
　 use of a standard name or r i g i d designator in the possible worlds framework implies agt is so  acquainted  with the referent of d that he could not possibly misidentlfy i t . that  however  is too atrong a condition. ultimately  one would l i k e to r e l a t i v i z e i d e n t i f i c a t i o n to a  purpose . 
i d e n t i f y . by regarding such utterances as requests  we expect to reap the benefits of theories and process models having to do with the generation and understanding of requests. to show some of these potential beneflta  we shall consider utterances that oocurred in our study. 
d. the dialogues 
     the evidence used w i l l be transcript fragments of task-oriented dialoguea. following the sri task-oriented dialogue paradigm   1     1 adult university students   experts   were videotaped as they instructed other students   novices   in assembling a toy water pump. communication employed any one of f i v e communication modes: face-to-faoe  telephone  teletype  audiotape  and written  of.   1     . part of the purpose of the study was to investigate the constraints that modality   e . g .   teletype  impose on discourse structure. in a l l dialogues  the novices could manipulate the pieces  while the experts could not. in the face-to-face mode  the expert could see the novloe's aasembly. in a l l other modea  the expert had his/her own set of pieces but could not assemble them. 
     utteranoea in the dialoguea were coded by two assistanta trained by the author. for a discussion of the coding system  r e l i a b i l i t y s t a t i s t i c s   and preliminary results see   1   . the coding allowed for the following speech acts  and many others : 
o requesting physical actions 
o questioning whether a physical action was completed 
o informing that a particular phyalcal action was completed 
o requesting that the hearer identify the referent of a description 
o questioning 	whether 	i d e n t i f i c a t i o n 	was completed 
o informing 	that 	i d e n t i f i c a t i o n 	was completed 
e.the goal structure of task-oriented dialoguea 
     the following goal atructure la appropriate to a l l modes of our dialogues: for each aasembly goal-state   e . g .    connect main-tube air-chamber    the expert haa the following goala: 
1. select 	an 	action 	achieving 	that 	goal atate. 
1. get 	the 	apprentice 	to 	perform 	that action. 
1. ensure success of the action. 
1      since we assume the experts are creating and executing plans  goals derived from  1  lead to the expert'a planning and exeouting requests for assembly actions. in face-to-faoe mode  the experts achieve goal  1  through vision. for telephone and teletype dialoguea  apprenttices inform the expert when actions are completed. occasionally  when the apprentice is taking longer than expected  or in face-to-face dialogues  when the apprentice'a body- is blooking the expert's view  experts question whether the requested action has been completed. these speech acts  requesting actions  informing that actions were completed  and questioning the completion of actions w i l l be seen to pertain as well to the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of referents. before showing that the overall structuring is the same  we w i l l discuss the many ways requests get made and show that those same ways arise for i d e n t i f i c a t i o n . 
f. 	reouaats 	to 	identify 
     in this section  we present various types of requests occurring in our dialogues and a set of parallel examples of what we w i l l c a l l requesting i d e n t i f i c a t i o n . requests for action w i l l be abbreviated by  r act    and requests for i d e n t i f i c a t i o n w i l l be labelled as  r id  . the modality of communication is indicated parenthetically. 
direct 	requests 
o   f i t the blue cap over the tube end.  r act   written  
o  notice the two side outlets on the chamber  r id   written  
indirect requests 
o  we want to cover the bottom one with a l i t t l e blue cover.  r act   telephone  
o  there's 	a 	long 	cylinder 	that 	has 	a 
	s l i g h t l y 	purplish 	cast 	to 	i t .   	r id  
 telephone; 
o  now you uh  you can place that uh  the rod in through the  that end of the pump  r act   face-to-face  
o  - on the table is a small  simple red plug without a hole.  r id   written  
o   1 . black f l e x i b l e r i n g  skinny donutl i k e     r id   written  
o  do you see small/ three small red pieces   r id   telephone  
o  now you have two devices 	that 	that are clear p l a s t i c   r id  	 telephone  
o  now. the smallest of the red pieces   r id   telephone  
     many of these examples are discussed in d e t a i l below. we have already discussed direct requests to identify stated as single imperatives. importantly  these utterances show that the goal of i d e n t i f i c a t i o n can be achieved in a separate step. because of the goal structure of our task-oriented dialogues  the success of i d e n t i f i c a t i o n requests should be questioned and reported just l i k e requests for physical acts. we shall return to this point l a t e r . 
g. indirect requests to identify 
     perhaps the most interesting aspect of requests is that they need not occur as imperatives. if the intentions behind an utterance are to be inferred from i t s form  then it is problematic that utterances nominally expressing one intention are often used to get the hearer to infer another intention. for example  utterances beginning with  you can  act   might l i t e r a l l y mean  you now have permission to do  act   - i . e . . are actually informing the hearer of something. however  in our s i t u a t i o n   suoh utterances are taken to mean  do  aot  . clearly  not a l l situations in which one person gives another permission to do something allow one to infer the speaker wants the act to be done  now .  consider  you can go on that t r i p without me  if you want 
t o .     
     for our transcripts  this problem of i n f e r r i n g the right intention occurs even more frequently with i d e n t i f i c a t i o n . regarding the above examples   there i s . . .   i s l i t e r a l l y a n informing act about the state of the world  as is  on the table is . . .   and  now you have two .   . . the same utterances could appear in other circumstances and would not lead a listener/reader to infer that an object was intended to be i d e n t i f i e d . for example  as part of the setting of a mystery story  similar statements  whatever their function  are obviously not intended to get the reader to search his/her perceptual world. our task  as analysts  is to uncover the conditions under which hearers are to make such inferences. perrault and allen  show how  by assuming hearers are trying to recognize speakers' plans  a speaker's ostensibly informing the hearer that the precondition to some act is true can be seen as requesting the hearer to perform that act  provided it is shared knowledge that the speaker would want the primary effect of that act. 
     assuming that the precondition to identify is that there must exist an object perceptually accessible to the hearer satisfying the description  then  for utterances whose logical form is exists  x : d x   perrault and allen's general method applies. the method generates an identify act as part of the hearer's model of the speaker's plan  provided it is shared knowledge that the speaker has some reason to want the description to be i d e n t i f i e d  for example  to enable the hearer to perform a physical action . thus  the plan-based inference that someone may want the precondition for an act to hold because they want to do that act generalizes to identify. 
     other evidence to substantiate the generalization from requesting physical acts to requesting identify is in the area of questions. many researchers   e . g .   labov and fanshel   have noticed that some questions about whether an act  or the f i n a l state of an act  has been accomplished convey the speaker's intention that the hearer do that act if she has not already done so. thus  is the garbage out   can be a request to take out the garbage  provided the speaker is believed to want this state of a f f a i r s . perrault and allen's model extends easily to this oase. 
     the same phenomenon appears to occur with  do you see small/three small red pieces   the hearer may not be looking at the pieces   but at the camera  the f l o o r   or somewhere else  and could perhaps t r u t h f u l l y answer  no . of course  the speaker intended the hearer to look f o r   i . e .   identify  something described as  the small red piece.  
     yet other phenomena that appear susoeptible to the same treatment are certain oases of e l l i p t i c a l questions  such as  now  the smallest of the red pieces   the action to be performed is not 
1 

e x p l i c i t l y stated here and must be supplied on the basis of shared knowledge about 	the 	situation - who can do/see what  	what each thinks the other believes  	what 	is expeoted  	etc. 	such knowledge w i l l 	be 	needed 	to 	d i f f e r e n t i a t e 	the 	intentions behind 	 the 	1 	to 	montreal    	where 	the description's i d e n t i f i c a t i o n is not intended  	froa those 	underlying 	the 	above 	sentence  	where 	the hearer is intended to find the pieoe. 
     according to the theory  the speaker's intentions conveyed by the e l l i p t i c a l question include 1  the speaker's wanting to know whether some property holds of the referent of the description  1   and 1  the speaker's perhaps wanting that property to hold. allen  suggests that properties that need to be inferred to   f i l l i n   fragments come from shared expectations. in our domain  it is shared knowledge that the hearer w i l l pick up pieces that the expert describes  since both know it is a manual assembly task . 
given the expectation to pick up  the property in allen's scheme that must hold is that the hearer 
knowref d  where knowref is defined as exist x   x 
= d  & h believe  x = d    which is an exceedingly strong way to say that the hearer has i d e n t i f i e d the referent. since t h i s is the f i r s t reference to the piece in question  it is shared knowledge that the hearer has not previously i d e n t i f i e d the referent of d. in the same way that questioning the completion of an action can convey a request for that action  questioning identified-ref can convey a request to identify. notice that the expectation that the description is to be i d e n t i f i e d is independent of the specific expectation to pick-up; it depends only on the expectation that the hearer is to perform some action on a physloally present objeot. for example  while a nuclear reactorscrubbing robot would expeot commands to perform action a; on the i n t e r i o r of the reaotor  it should not a t t r i b u t e pick-up as a speaker's intention solely on hearing  there's a glowing r o d   . 
h. evidence far identify froa hearer responses 
     another kind of evidence to support our claim that i d e n t i f i c a t i o n is a planned and recognized action is participants' performance of the same speech acts with the same surface forms in response to what we are c a l l i n g requests for i d e n t i f i c a t i o n as they do in responding to requests for action. for example  in a telephone dialogue we found the following: 
a. a:  and attach the pink thing so that it covers the hole in the middle.  
request a b  mesh b valye1 tube-base   
b. 	b:  got i t 
one way valve. 
we're a l l set  
inf1rm b a  completed b  mesh ...    
o. a:  ok  now there' a  black jteeiag  
request a b  identify b  a black o-ring    
d. 	b:  got i t   
inf1rm b a  completed b identify ..    
     speaker 	b 	used 	 got 	i t   	frequently 	for signalling that he was finished performing actions. it would therefore be unreasonable to say that  got i t   	in 	 c  	was 	suddenly 	intended 	l i t e r a l l y 	to convey 	that 	b was simply 	informing 	that 	he 	was 
1 
holding the piece. 
     we have shown that  just l i k e requests for action  requests for i d e n t i f i c a t i o n occur as separate steps  come in the same forms  and provoke the same responses froa hearers. we have also suggested how existing computational models might be applied to identify and yield appropriate analyses. it should be clear that by positing an identify act  coupled with a plan-based account of indirect speech act interpretation  we stand to gain a more unified account of apparently similar phenomena that would otherwise be unrelated. 
i i i . when are separate requests to identify used  
     major questions for computational models of language production and comprehension become: 
o how and why should a system plan separate requests for i d e n t i f i c a t i o n rather than simply produce imperatives requesting assembly actions  
1 under what conditions w i l l systems be confronted with such utterances  
i. 	production 
     the answer to the f i r s t question is suggested by the following fragment of a teletype dialogue: 
1. b:  anyway  put the red piece with the strange projections loosely into the bottom hole on the main tube. ok   
1. a: 	 which 	hole 	the 	bottom one 	on 	the side   
1. b: 	 right 	put the 	1 	inch long 	'post' into the loosely f i t t i n g h o l e . . . 
1. n: i don't understand what you mean 
1. b: 	the 	red 	piece  	with 	the 	four 	tiny projections  
1. n: ok 
1. b: just place it loosely   i n t o the  
1. n:  done  b & n typed simultaneously  causing gibberish to appear on each 
screen  
1. b: yes  
1. n: yes 
1. b: place it loosely into the hole on the side of the large tube... 
1. n: done 
1. b: very good. 	see the clear elbow tube  
1. n: yes 
1. b: 	place 	the 	large 	end 	over 	that same place. 
1. n: ready 
1* b: take the clear dome and attach it to the end of the elbow j o i n t . . . 
1. n: using the blue attachment part  
1. b: r i g h t   i t ' s already attached  so i d i d n ' t mention it now  put the red nozzle over the hole in the dome.  
     there are three strategies of instruction here. f i r s t   direct requests for assembly actions  in the form of imperatives  as in line  1 . second  there are conjoined direct requests  for picking up followed by an assembly action as in  1 . f i n a l l y   b performs separate requests to i d e n t i f y   each followed by a request for an assembly action as in  1  -  1  and  1  -  1 . 
     what is important to notice here la that b shifts his strategy   i n a fashion that resembles driving a three-speed oar . prior to this fragment  the conversation had proceeded smoothly  in  high gear   so to speak  with b i n i t i a l l y  upahifting  from f i r s t a  take and assemble  request to six oonsecutlve assembly requests  one of them i n d i r e c t     the last of which is utterance 1 of this fragment. 
     in  1 - ii   we observe c l a r i f i c a t i o n dialogue about a prior noun phrase. immediately after an apparent breakdown at  1   b  downshifts  to questioning the achievement of his f i r s t subgoal  identifying the red piece. once that is corrected  and a channel contention problem is solved  b stays in  low gear   e x p l i c i t l y ensuring success of his reference   i n  1 - 1   before requesting an assembly action in  1 . after that success  he  upshifts  to  second gear  - with requests to pick-up and assemble in  1 . after being successful yet again  b  upshifts  in  1  to  high gear   again using a dlreot assembly request  and stays in  high  for the rest of the dialogue  six more requests . 
what could explain t h i s conversation pattern  
a representation of the plan for assembling shows clearly that to i n s t a l l a piece  one must be holding i t ; to hold it  one must pick it up; to perform any action on an object  one must have i d e n t i f i e d that object. by requesting an assembly action   high gear    one requires the listener to make the remaining inferences. by requesting the sequence take-and-aasemble   second gear    the speaker makes one of the inferences himself  but requires the listener to realize that i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of the speaker's part description is needed. finally   low gear  involves the speaker's checking the success of the component subgoals  which involves description i d e n t i f i c a t i o n . 
     in summary  the strategy s h i f t to  low gear  occurs after a r e f e r e n t i a l miscommunlcatlon because it affords a more precise monitoring of the l i s t e n e r ' s achievement of goals.* a task-oriented dialogue system should have  dialogue sense  enough to plan utterances tailored to the user's problem. 
j. language comprehension - speech vs. teletype 
       our second question is  under what conditions j w i l l systems be confronted with such utterances and 
　 the use of separate utterances for i d e n t i f i c a t i o n has also been observed independently by ochs  schieffelln  and pratt  for parentchild discourse. 
	speech 	acts   	we 	have 	observed 	that 
request identify  and question identified-ref  occur frequently in telephone communication and quite infrequently in teletype communication. the magnitude differences in our transcripts are quite s t r i k i n g . for example  the only examples of either speech act occurring in f i v e teletype dialogues are the two above - where the speaker is concentrating on i d e n t i f i c a t i o n because of  we suspect  prior r e f e r e n t i a l misoommunication. by way of contrast  these speeoh acts are prevalent  if not predominant  in a l l f i v e telephone dialogues. the t o t a l number of instances of these speeoh act types ranges from a low of seven to a high of 1  mean = 1  per dialogue. 
iv. concluding remarks 
     we have justified the need for a planned identify action with evidence from human dialogues. by incorporating an identify act into a plan-based theory of speech acts  the resulting theory can explain regularities of dialogue for which it was not designed. in particular it accounts for speakers' requesting that hearers i d e n t i f y the referents of descriptions  for their questioning the success of referent i d e n t i f i c a t i o n   and for hearers' reports of that success. we have suggested how computational methods ourrently being used to  reason out  the oonveyed force of a class of indirect requests for action can be applied successfully to a class of  what we w i l l c a l l   indirect requests for i d e n t i f i c a t i o n . 
     analysis of teletype and telephone interactions shows a marked difference across modes in the use of e x p l i c i t requests for i d e n t i f i c a t i o n . thus  speech understanding systems may have to be prepared for language use that departs quite dramatically from that addressed to teletype-based systems. we speculate that the more competent the speech-understanding system i s   the more it w i l l receive such requests. we expect these findings to also have ramifications for the design of taskoriented dialogue systems   1   1   for distributed a r t i f i c i a l intelligence systems   1     and for models of language generation   1   1 . 
     there are obviously many unsolved problems regarding i d e n t i f i c a t i o n . we do not know how to define such an act  how to construct descriptions to ensure i t s success nor how it becomes a goal. nevertheless  in this paper  we hope to have shown the necessity and u t i l i t y of considering i d e n t i f i c a t i o n in a model of natural language processing for task-oriented dialogue. however our data are to be explained  we expect i d e n t i f i c a t i o n to play part.
