text 
　　our data are taken from verbatim t r a n s c r i p t s of tape-recorded psychoanalytic sessions. these have been exhaustively p r o o f l i s t e n e d and punctuated so t h a t   sort of a phonemic r e n d e r i n g   t h e i r reading is as close to a t r a n s l a t i o n of the a u d i t o r y record as we are capable o f . in the passages that we s h a l l use as examples it is our judgment that the i n t o n a t i o n s and other speech c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s would not s i g n i f i c a n t l y a l t e r any of our observations or conclusions. as psychotherapy researchers who have examined t r a n s c r i p t s know  the spontaneous speech of a person in psychotherapy is f u l l of d i s f l u e n cies unusual even for spoken discourse. it is r i d dled w i t h sentence fragments and f a l s e s t a r t s   w i t h s y n t a c t i c and semantic anomalies and w i t h i d i o s y n cracies and ambiguity. the t e x t we s h a l l examine is a three-paragraph excerpt from the f i f t h hour of the psychoanalysis of a young schoolteacher: 
f 1. because i  i  chuckle  was just thinking i probably do the same thing with david. last night in particular  i was talking with him about - i 
don't know  i just seemed to be in a funny mood by the time he got home. he got home sort of late  and it wasn't that he was late  beoause i knew he would he. but i guess he didn't immediately respond to me in the way i wanted him to or - 
that somehow i was already in some kind of a 
mood. and  sniff  at one point i was talking to him  and i know i was talking to him wanting either confirmation that i'd done the right thing or a suggestion on what would be a right thing beoause i wasn't sure. i was upset about something i'd done 
and i didn't want him just to listen to me say i t . i wanted him to actually react to i t   and either suggest another course of 
1 	i don't know what it was  	because i imagine 
action or  or approval that well  i gueee that in the circumstances that wasn't that bad a thing to do. and  anti he just didn't eay anything  except sort of mutter under hie breath. and eo i got furious at him and  eniff  i imagine in a way i t ' s 
the same kind of thing that my father always is 
doing.  pause  stomach rumble.  
i 1. because the thing i did that - it wasn't that important a thing i did that i was upset 
about  but it was indicative of something i'm doing a l l the time - was  uhm  the particular incident was  i have two boys in school who are constantly together. they were friends before. and i t ' s dis-
ruptive to the class now because they 're  whenever we're doing some kind of a group activity  they're so busy moving around inside the group  staying together and then changing places in the - if we're s i t t i n g on the f- f l o o r up in the front t h e y ' l l be changing places where they're s i t t i n g - and so they sort of tunnel through the whole group and they're talking together and everything. and it really i s n ' t good f o r them anyway  just in their cutting out other people so that they are only together within themselves. and i'm trying to encourage them to separate themselves from each other as much as possible. and once in a while if i'm really tired and worn-out and there they are disrupting the groupd again  i get a l i t t l e annoyed at them on - again  though i know i shouldn't. 
i 1. and yesterday - i had been thinking about calling the parents - and yesterday - just to let them know that  if the children wexse kind of upset 
at what i was doing  the reason for it would be this  and that they  if they wanted to support i t   they could by explaining that there were lots of 
boys to be friends with at the school and that type of thing. and - but i hadn't called them - and i saw one of the mothers at the dismissal when she came to pick up her boy. and i never like talking to parents then because it was just too confusing. but of course i just said something to her that was  you know  chatty. and then  and then i suddenly found myself starting to talk about this problem  which i hadn't intended to at a l l . and i  i was kind of surprised at myself when i was talking and  then i just couldn't keep quiet  chuckle . i couldn't stop i t   or say well  we better talk about this another time or anything. and i just seemed to get in deeper and deeper and i'm always doing this. 
linguistic naps 
　　the technique of producing linguistic maps arose out of a need to understand some puzzling features of this text; the solution lay in finding a special way to classify the information and represent i t . categories of information in the sequential text are mapped into a structure designed to enhance the clarity of the content and to facilitate the recognition of the  meaningful configurations  sought by the clinician. the procedure for constructing a 
map is straightforward. 	sequential elements of the text are placed into columns in such a fashion that 
each column constitutes a particular category of information  e.g. a continuity of manifest theme  a set of particular syntactic or semantic features  parenthetical comments of the same type  etc. 
there are no restrictions except that the nature of the elements in a single column be describable. when an element of text does not f i t in an existing column a new column is added to the map. thus there is a one-to-one mapping of the textual ele-
ments into a structural form with the sequential information retained. 
   the adequacy of the mapping can be assessed according to the two general principles that rosch  1  has proposed for the formation of categories of any type: 
the f i r s t has to do with the function of category systems and asserts that the task of category systems is to provide maximum information with the least cognitive e f f o r t ; the second has to do with the structure of the information so provided and asserts that the perceived world comes as structured information rather than as arbitrary or unpredictable attributes  p. 1  i t a l i c s added . 
   figure 1  which requires exceptional eyesight or a magnifying glass  shows the linguistic map we constructed for paragraphs 1  1 and 1. a pattern emerges from this map that was not readily detectable in the original text. reading down the columns  we see that the patient is basically relating an incident at school  but she interrupts the narrative to mention other aspects of the s i t u ation as well. the  structural  hypothesis formalized in this linguistic map is that the patient is 
not talking about one subject but nine different subjects. the predominant feature of the map  however  is the patient's hesitant manner of reporting what happened at school. a mere glance at column 1 makes it immediately and visually clear that the patient delayed in telling the analyst what actually occurred. indeed the f i r s t element in column 1 
 1  is a deleted reference to the event! and this is followed by ten more unresolved or p a r t i a l ly resolved forward references before she finally  1  tells something of what she did that she was upset about  1 . so a clear puzzle emerges: why did the patient delay telling the analyst  
   we shall return to this question later with a hypothetical answer that emerges out of our l i n guistic map and frames we derive from i t . but now we need to examine figure 1 more carefully and describe some of its properties. first of a l l   aa we 
have already seen  this map is a dramatic way to represent a puzzle visually as well as linguistically. second  the map permits us  for example  by reading down a column  to see the  structured i n formation  in the connections among previously discontinuous elements. 
   third  in the process of constructing the map we are forced  because they stand as clues to the i n dication of a new category  to focus on certain linguistic features that might otherwise be overlooked. for example  elements  1  and  1  read in part    . . . the particular incident was  i 
have two boys in school who are ...  . 	here the incompatibility of the tenses leads us to infer that the information about the two boys is back-
ground for the incident at school. 
a fourth property of the map is reflected in the 

1 

i n a l t e x t . one strength of maps is that they tend to reveal t h e o r e t i c a l biases r a t h e r than mask our p r e conceptions so that we might take them i n t o e x p l i c i t c o n s i d e r a t i o n . by p r o v i d ing  maximum i n f o r m a t i o n 
w i t h least c o g n i t i v e eff o r t   maps have made poss i b l e the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of personal event frames. 
frames 
　　we have taken p a r t of our t i t l e as w e l l as the concept of frames from minsky  1  who proposed them as a means of r e p r e senting in computer p r o grams knowledge of s t e r e o typed s i t u a t i o n s in the r e a l w o r l d . i n h i s f a v o r i t e example of a c h i l d ' s b i r t h d a y p a r t y   matters such as dress  food and presents are terminals with d e f a u l t assignments based on the stereotyped expectations associated w i t h such p a r t i e s . thus the d e f a u l t f o r dress i s   f o r a l i t t l e g i r l   her sunday best and the d e f a u l t f o r food is ice cream and cake  e t c . 
	according 	to minsky: 
much of the phenomen-
o l o g i c a l power of the theory hinges on the i n c l u s i o n of expectations and other kinds of presumptions. a frame's terminals are normally already f i l l e d w i t h   d e f a u l t   a s s i g n ments. thus  a frame may contain a great many d e t a i l s whose supp o s i t i o n i s not s p e c i f i c a l l y warranted by the s i t u a t i o n . these have many uses in representing general information  

choice of t i t l e s f o r the columns  w h i c h   w i t h two exceptions  are phrases from the content or close paraphrases. we now b e l i e v e these t i t l e s accord 
w i t h roach's general p r i n c i p l e that c e r t a i n types of  categories tend to become defined in terms of prototypes or p r o t o t y p i c a l instances t h a t c o n t a i n the a t t r i b u t e s most r e p r e s e n t a t i v e of items i n s i d e and l e a s t r e p r e s e n t a t i v e of items outside the category    p . 1 . 
　　a f i f t h c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of the map is t h a t it is an attempt to cut at the j o i n t s   to d i s s e c t along n a t u r a l tissue boundaries  to uncover some of the inherent manifest s t r u c t u r e embedded in the o r i g -
	m o s t - l i k e l y cases  	tech-
niques f o r bypassing   l o g i c     and ways to make u s e f u l g e n e r a l i s a t i o n s . 
　　the d e f a u l t assignments are attached loosely to t h e i r t e r m i n a l s   so t h a t they can be e a s i l y 
displaced by new items t h a t b e t t e r f i t the curr e n t s i t u a t i o n . they thus can serve also as   v a r i a b l e s   or as s p e c i a l cases f o r  reasoning by example   or as  textbook cases.  and o f t e n make the use of l o g i c a l q u a n t i f i e r s unnecessary  pp.1 . 
　　we became i n t e r e s t e d in frames because we recognized an analogous problem in representing s t e r e o -
	typed  	r e p e t i t i v e sequences of events 	in the behav-
1 

ior of individual people. it seemed to us that the features of minsky's system were adaptable to representing the analyst's knowledge about these repetitive event sequences that are so characteristic a part of every analysand's report of the events in his personal l i f e . the cast may change  the s i t u ations may vary  but the plots endure with structural tenacity. 
　　our decision to try to adapt frame theory to our needs is a very recent one  resulting from a recognition that we had no systematic way to represent the repetition of event sequences. the terminology we have adapted from minsky is as follows: 
personal event frame - representation of a repetitive event sequence. 
events - elements in a personal event frame that must be f i l l e d by specific instances or data. 
prototype - the f i r s t identified pe frame with j u s t i f i c a t i o n from the data for each event. 
instantiation - any subsequent occurrence of a pe frame with evidence for each event from the data. 
expected value - the value of an event given in the prototype frame. 
default assignment - the expected value of an event that is used when a given instantiation does not provide a value. 
variables - a l l of the events in a frame that can assume different values. 
frame system - a set of frames with shared events. 
　　figure 1 schematically represents two pe frames  one entitled delay and the other support. each pe frame consists of a series of events joined by arrows indicating a fixed sequence of occurrence. events include wishing  believing  perceiving  feeling  thinking  acting  etc. the phrase in each event box p a r t i a l l y describes the default assignment  which is derived from the expected value of the corresponding event in the prototype frame. repetitions of a frame  whether with the same of different objects  are called instantiations. 

　　taken together  these two frames comprise the simplest case of a frame system because they have overlapping events. these are indicated by the dotted lines between corresponding events in the two frames. having conflicts overlaps the set of 
having a problem; and wanting   t o ask f o r   support 
is a subset of thinking of t a l k i n g . 
　　the prototypes f o r frame a  figure 1  and frame b  figure 1  were derived from the manifest content of two r e p o r t s by the p a t i e n t of behavior t h a t she h e r s e l f regards as s e l f - t y p i c a l behavior. a l l of the content f o r the frame a prototype follows l i n e 1 on the map and is bracketed by the statements    . . . i t was i n d i c a t i v e o f something i'm doing a l l the time   1  and   i ' m always doing t h i s     1 1   1   . the corresponding content f o r the frame b prototype precedes l i n e 1 and begins and ends with the comments   i probably do the same thing  1  . . . that my f a t h e r always is doing    1 1   1   . 
　　the delay frame prototype in figure 1 i l l u s t r a t e s the e s s e n t i a l s of the method. f i r s t   the f i v e events are abstracted form the n a r r a t i v e ; in t h i s case the p a t i e n t ' s d e s c r i p t i o n of her behavior w i t h the boys and t h e i r parents is abstracted i n t o the f i v e - e v e n t sequence. the next step is to provide j u s t i f i c a t i o n f o r the existence of each event in the form of documentation from the manifest data in the 
map. in c r e a t i n g the prototype frame we require that j u s t i f i c a t i o n of some type be given f o r each event. when a v a i l a b l e   statements that imply a warrent f o r making an i n d u c t i v e g e n e r a l i z a t i o n are also i n c l u d e d ; these are examples of the kind of addit i o n a l i n f o r m a t i o n that can be attached to a frame. 
　　two i n s t a n t i a t i o n s each are given f o r frame a and for frame b. in these cases  instead of i n c l u d i n g data to j u s t i f y the existence of the events  e v i dence to support a r e p e t i t i o n of the events in the frame is s p e c i f i e d . the requirements here are more relaxed than f o r the p r o t o t y p e   and we have permitted what we c a l l i n d i r e c t evidence from which we can   w i t h some p r o b a b i l i t y   make an inference as e v i d e n t i a l support. when no evidence can be found the default assignment is assumed  see f i g . 1  i n s t a n t i a t i o n 1  event 1 . 
　　a major strength of our proposal l i e s in the nature of the p r e d i c t i o n s that can be made from the prototype frames. the p r o t o t y p e   in e f f e c t   c o n s t i tutes a hypothesis t h a t   together w i t h a warrant for g e n e r a l i z a t i o n   e n t a i l s a p r e d i c t i o n that the same sequence of events w i l l occur again. thus  i n s t a n t i a t i o n s   to the degree they can be documented  conf i r m the p r e d i c t i o n and may be thought of as providing c o r r o b o r a t i v e evidence f o r the prototype frame. in a d d i t i o n the frame concept constrains what w i l l be considered evidence of i n s t a n t i a t i o n in two important ways. f i r s t   the p a r t i c u l a r events in an i n s t a n t i a t i o n must be s i m i l a r to the corresponding events in the p r o t o t y p e   e.g. the p a t i e n t may report c h a t t i n g instead of t a l k i n g . second  the events must occur in the sequence given in the prototype. each successive event in a frame  in other words  is c o n d i t i o n a l upon i t s predecessors. 
　　with t h i s point in mind  l e t us r e t u r n to the question posed e a r l i e r - why did the p a t i e n t delay in t e l l i n g the analyst about the i n c i d e n t at school  three relevant contextual facts were presumptively known to both the p a t i e n t and the analyst at t h i s time: f i r s t   the analyst had t o l d the p a t i e n t during the f i r s t a n a l y t i c session to  say whatever you're t h i n k i n g out l o u d ;   second  in t h i s session the analyst had said nothing p r i o r to t h i s text and had said very l i t t l e during the f i r s t four hours;

1. evidence for not getting support 
　　 1  i had been thinking about calling the parents . .. 
 1  but i hadn't called them. 
1. evidence for hostility 
   no evidence for overt hostility. evidence for covert hostility: 
　　 1  i saw one of the mothers at the dismissal. 
　　 1  i never like talking to parents then because it was just too confusing. 
　　 1  but of course i just said something to her that was . . . chatty. 
　　 1a  and then i suddenly started to talk about this problem  which i hadn't intended to at all. 
　　 1b  and then i couldn't keep quiet  chuckle . i couldn't stop it or say  well  we better talk about this another time or anything. 
　　inference: 	blurting out the problem to the mother at the dismissal  presumably in front of c h i l dren and other parents  and being unable to stop  even though she f e l t it was an inappropriate time  
is a covert act of h o s t i l i t y toward the mother.

1. evidence for wanting support 
   a. p has expressed a wish for husband's approval   i . e . support . 
   b. warrant for generalization  frame b  proto-type  suggests this is self-typical behavior. 
   c. p has expressed a wish for support from the boys' parents. 
   d. people in general want support when they are in conflict  i.e. this is  group-typical  behavior. induction: p wants support from the analyst.

1. expected value: 	not getting support = default assignment. 
   prediction: p expects to not get support from the analyst. 
   contextual evidence: the analyst has not said anything up to this point in the session. 
1. expected value: 	hostility = default assignment. 
　　prediction: p w i l l express h o s t i l i t y   either overt or covert toward the analyst. 

figure 1. 
text ends. 	nonetheless  the expected value for 
event 1 supplies the default value as a prediction: 
prediction: the patient expects to not get support from the analyst. 
and therefore  we hypothesize  she adopted a compromise solution: the delay dramatically apparent in column 1  coupled with the elaborate background and justifications in columns 1 through 1. simply put  her delay can be stated as a symptomatic com-promise between her desire for the analyst's approval and her expectation of not receiving i t . 
   inevitably this proposed explanation has the formal form of what psychoanalysts call a  transference  interpretation since the patient's delay 
is explained as an action directed toward the analyst. 	our method has provided two reasonably pre-
cise transference predictions about events to come  namely  statements by the patient at some later time - perhaps in the same session  perhaps not. 1 

the second of these is c o n d i t i o n a l upon the f i r s t : if p feels she has not gotten support from the analyst  then she will express some form of h o s t i l i ty toward him. and we can examine our t r a n s c r i p t s  and t h e i r maps  for statements bearing on these two p r e d i c t i o n s .   i n t h i s instance  both p r e d i c tions were confirmed.  
conclusion 
   we have gone i n t o a l o t of d e t a i l in order to i l l u s t r a t e the method of c o n s t r u c t i n g maps and frames and to demonstrate the f u n c t i o n of each in representing these two kinds of knowledge that wo have postulated to u n d e r l i e an a n a l y s t ' s i n t u i t i o n s . we f i n d it q u i t e astonishing to discover so much d e t a i l e d and d e f i n a b l e s t r u c t u r e in j u s t three short paragraphs comprising less than 1 1th of the t o t a l a n a l y s i s . but the true p o t e n t i a l of t h i s approach l i e s in the develop-
ments of frame systems w i t h overlapping events. even in the narrow domain we have examined there is at l e a s t one a d d i t i o n a l frame on the theme of togetherness  and it c l e a r l y shares the c o n f l i c t event w i t h the support frame. if we enlarge our domain to include the e n t i r e session and other sessions  it is easy to f i n d v a r i a t i o n s on the theme of delay by s u b s t i t u t i n g f o r the a c t i o n of t a l k i n g actions such as touching  telephoning  
shopping and sexual a c t i v i t y . moreover we also f i n d v a r i a n t s in which another person   e . g . f a t h e r   
mother  replaces the p a t i e n t as subject as w e l l as instances in which the objects of the a c t i o n are 
v a r i a b l e s   e . g . husband  a n a l y s t   e t c .   . taken t o gether these v a r i a n t s would c o n s t i t u t e a frame system on the theme; and taken w i t h other themes w i t h 
overlapping events we would have a more complex and i n t e r e s t i n g frame system that might begin to approach the complexity  or s i m p l i c i t y   of an anal y s t ' s actual r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of such p a t t e r n s . would give us clues to the o r i g i n s of the d e f a u l t assignments. minsky's d e s c r i p t i o n of the consequences of e a r l y childhood c o n f l i c t s can hardly be improved upon: 
　. . . d e f a u l t assignments would have s u b t l e   i d i o s y n c r a t i c influences on the paths an i n d i v i d u a l 
would tend to f o l l o w in making analogies  genera l i z a t i o n s   and judgments  e s p e c i a l l y when the e x t e r i o r influences on such choices are weak. properly chosen  such stereotypes could serve as valuable h e u r i s t i c p l a n - s k e l e t o n s ; badly s e l e c t ed  they could form paralyzing c o l l e c t i o n s of i r r a t i o n a l biases. because of them one might exp e c t   as reported by freud  to detect evidences o f e a r l y c o g n i t i v e s t r u c t u r e s i n   f r e e associat i o n   t h i n k i n g  pp. 1 . 
   we have postulated that the main f u n c t i o n of the mapping stage is that of c l a s s i f i c a t i o n   a s o r t i n g out of the i n t e r l o c k i n g n a r r a t i v e s and the undoing of the surface d i s f l u e n c i e s and d i s c o n t i n u i t i e s to e s t a b l i s h the connectedness of the seemingly d i s connected elements. we have f u r t h e r proposed that t h i s c l a s s i f i c a t i o n f a c i l i t a t e s the second step of the c o g n i t i v e process  which is to i d e n t i f y the r e l a t i v e l y i n v a r i a n t s t r u c t u r e d sequences of events that are repeatd over and over w i t h symbolically equivalent expressions of the events  repeated w i t h subjects and objects of the a c t i o n as v a r i a b l e s . our basic claim is that these pe frames stand as the basis for i n d u c t i v e i n f e r e n c e s   f o r the p r e d i c tions e n t a i l e d in them and for the organizing of the data for t h e i r c o n f i r m a t i o n or d i s c o n f i r m a t i o n .
