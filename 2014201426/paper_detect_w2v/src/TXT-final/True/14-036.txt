modified when new evidence is received. when a retinal impression has been the statements give positions of received it must be analyzed to find those end-points of lines and other spatial regions which represent space and those facts in terms of a cartesian coordinate which represent objects or verge. then system centred on utak. a spatial problem the object regions must be distinguished is to be solved by projecting a l l or part from the verge regions in an of the world model onto a screen - utak's interpretation stage so that finally the map-in-the-head - then solving the world model can be modified to accommodate problem there and translating the solution  explain  them. the next three - the plan - back into the cartesian sub-sections describe these operations coordinate system. at a l l times there is  steps 1 1 of 1 .

between the actual and predicted retinal impressions may arise from two sources of

parts of the retinal impression. 
1  the spatial planner 
　　　this is the heart of the system  where path-finding is done  where a plan for moving an object is constructed  and where the i n i t i a l task command is interpreted. given an interpreted task description  the spatial planner uses the current world model as a database and produces a structured plan as output. if the current world model reflects the  real world  outside the organism sufficently closely  or at least models closely enough those parts of the world model required for this task  then a completely accurate execution of the plan w i l l result in the successful completion of the task. 
　　　the spatial planner does not produce plans from the world model directly  but indirectly via the screen  a 1-dimensional digital array. consider a simple pathfinding problem   go to the north east corner  for example. first the dimensions of a rectangular window which includes both the current position of utak and the position of the destination are computed. then the world model is projected through this window onto the screen and each square of the screen marked as representing space or with the name of the object ovarlaying i t . then a pathfinding algorithm is used  cf. section 1  to find a path from start to destination that only traverses cells representing space. 
1 path-finding and the skeleton of a planar shape 
- a introduction to path-f inding algorithms 
     the problem is this. given a 
     description of shapes on the euclidean plane in terms of the cartesian coordinates of points on the boundaries of the shapes and the lines between them  and given the coordinates of two points s and d outside a l l the shapes  describe a path from s to d that avoids a l l the shapes  if such a path exists. further requirements are that the path should be reasonably close to being optimal  and that if an organism wanders slightly from the correct path  either due to inaccurate movement or to avoid a small obstacle  it should be easy to regain the correct path. 
　　　a path-finding algorithm was incorporated in the design of shakey . it was based on the observation that in a cluttered space an optimal path between two points consists of a sequence of line segments connecting extreme points of obstacles. thus one starts with the extreme  convex  points on the obstacle boundaries and considers the set consisting of the lines joining the pairs of extreme points together with lines from the starting point s to the extreme points and with lines from the extreme points to the destination point d. any line which intersects an obstacle is discarded  so that the remaining lines represent a l l the  lines of v i s i b i l i t y   in the situation. a heuristic search is then used to find the optimal series of points connected by lines of v i s i b i l i t y from s to d. 
　　　another idea is to project a l l the shapes onto a rectangular network of cells  the screen of section 1 for example  and convert the path-finding problem into a pure graph-traversal problem. the screen is converted to a graph by inserting between every pair of adjacent or diagonally adjacent cells an edge of the graph  where each edge is assigned a lenqth of root1 or one according as its endpoints are diagonally adjacent or not. it is forbidden to traverse edges leading to cells that do not represent floorspace. the start and destination points are mapped onto cells s and d of the graph. the problem can now be restated as: find the shortest path from s to d along the edges of this graph. this can be done by an application of the 
a* algorithm of  using their function f=g+h to evaluate incomplete paths. 
　　　finally the skeleton of the shape of the empty space was considered. the i n i t i a l attraction was that the skeletal graph contains only the topologically distinct paths between two positions. two paths are topologically distinct if neither can be continuously deformed into the other. the search for a path then reduces to searching over the topologically distinct paths. the choice points in the skeleton seem  intuitively  to correspond to the choices we have to make in navigating through obstacles. in addition there is a great deal of information associated with the skeleton which can be used in other spatial problems. the optimum path  when restricted to edges of the skeletal graph  is not in general the optimum path when no such restrictions are made; however  our i n i t i a l concern was to compute any reasonable path  not necessarily an optimal one. 
1. 1 the skeleton 
	blum  	who 	called it the medial axis 
function   was the first to introduce the skeleton of a planar shape. since then it has been the topic of several investigations  1 1 1  and has 
1 

been called the distance transformation  the grassfire transformation  or the symmetric axis transformation.  1  has comprehensively analysed it and written about its potential applications to the description of shape in biology. various definitions and algorithms for computing the skeleton in a digital space are given in . 
1 using the skeleton for path-finding 
     use of the skeleton of the shape delineated on a network promised to overcome most of the objections to the use of heuristic search for pathfinding. 
　　　first assume that the start cell s and the destination cell d l i e on the skeletal graph. then a path from s to d along the skeletal graph is certainly a spatial path. in searching for a path through the skeletal graph  the junction cells and junction sets are the only places where a choice is needed. to simplify this search the pathgraph  homomorphic to the skeletal graph  is defined as follows. the vertices of the pathgraph correspond to the junctions  cells or sets  of the skeletal graph  and an edge between two vertices of the pathgraph corresponds to the chain of cells in the skeletal graph between the corresponding junctions. a skeletal graph and its corresponding pathgraph is shown in figure 1. now a l l the topologically distinct spatial paths from s to d are found by using a standard graph traversing algorithm on the pathgraph  with considerably less search than when the network of cells is searched directly. if the start s or destination d are not on the skeletal graph then the nearest points to s and d on the skeletal graph  s' and d'  must f i r s t be found. 

1 summary and conclusions 
 a  we have explicitly described the features of the action cycle for a robot-controller; this has not been done 
before. 
 b  a spatial reasoning module is an important and essential part of any robot-controller. it makes plans for action on the basis of the current collection of hypotheses about the form of the environment. the second advance is the development of a new approach to problems of spatial reasoning based on the use of the skeleton of a two-dimensional shape. 
　　　some interesting technical problems were uncovered in this approach. one we call the rope-tightening problem. when you have found one reasonable path between two points  how do you tighten the path to the shortest possible wav  the other technical problem relates to elucidating the f u l l details for moving an l-shaped 
object through a doorway. 
 c  there have been several robot simulation programs written before; however this is the f i r s t to handle the movement and collision of two dimensional shapes. our contribution is to use a combination of the cartesian and the diqital representations to simulate the motion and collision of objects on a 
 tabletop. 
　　　we began this project by asking what computational processes are required for spatial reasoninq. our answer  and  briefly  the conclusion of the paper  is this. computational processes 
incorporating algorithms for computing the digital skeleton of a planar shape may prove to be sufficient for the spatial 
reasoning of a robot-controller.
