　　　the a c t i v i t y in small networks of randomly connected a r t i f i c i a l neurons  simulated on a d i g i t a l computer  is described. networks with only excitatory connections  and networks with both excitatory and inhibitory connections are considered. 
introduction 
　　　much of the work on brain models in the late 1's and early 1's comprised the construct i o n   either in hardware  or more commonly by simulation on a d i g i t a l computer  of networks of a r t i f i c i a l neurons  hereafter the term 'neuron' w i l l refer to a r t i f i c i a l neurons  where necessary brain cells w i l l be referred as 'natural neurons' . historically the idea networks of neurons performing brain like functions stems from the work of mcculloch and p i t t s . 
　　　similar work was presented and expanded by kleene   who showed that it is possible to represent any definite event   i . e . an event comprising a definite set of input sequences but not an event whose input sequences extend indefinitely into the past  in a f i n i t e automaton 
which could be constructed from mcculloch-pitts neurons. unfortunately this work is of l i t t l e practical help to model builders  it points out some of the possibilities and limitations of the excercise without giving any firm guidelines as to the construction of such models. 
　　　the process of neuron modelling adopted by various workers has tended to follow a f a i r l y fixed pattern  starting with a description of some of the generally assumed properties of natural neurons  and the interconnections between them  giving a framework for the construction of a network of neurons. these networks have then received discrete or continuous input stimulation and some record made of the resultant pattern of a c t i v i t y . there may or may not be any modification  adaption  of the network parameters to attempt to demonstrate learning by the network. 
generally assumed properties of neurons 
　　　most model neurons incorporate a l l or many of the following features  see f i g 1 . the inputs to a neuron may be either excitatory  e    positive  or inhibitory  i    negative . each input connection has a certain weight ascribed to i t   if an impulse is received along a particular fibre an amount of excitation  positive or negative  proportional to the weight of the connection is given to the neuron. the neuron is a threshold device; it has an ' a l l or none' mode of operation and w i l l only produce an out-

put   f i r e   if i t s excitation exceeds a certain predetermined  threshold  value. 
thus the neuron w i l l f i r e if 
		 1  
where t is the threshold and e  is proportional to the weight of the i t h . 	excitatory connection if an input pulse has just been received along i t h . fibre  and zero otherwise 
　　　the neuron does not transmit an output pulse as soon as the excitation exceeds the threshold value  there is a short delay - corresponding to the synaptic delay in natural neurons - before on output pulse is transmitted. although in natural systems a neuron may apparently f i r e at any time  in simulation experiments it is only possible to deal with discrete time intervals  thus the synaptic delay time  t  is usually taken as the unit of time. therefore ifat time t - 1 a neuron receives an amount of excitation greater than i t s threshold value it w i l l transmit an output pulse at time t =1 to a l l neurons connected to i t s axon branches  this output becomes an input to these neurons at time t ＊ 1  unless some speed of travel constraint is applied to the connections. normally a l l cells with 
which an axon system connects receive inputs in the same time interval irrespective of their distance from the originating c e l l . 
　　　if a neuron does not f i r e in a particular time step after receiving some excitation then  in many models  i t s excitation does not immediately drop to zero but f a l l s exponentially towards tero with a time constant usually of the order of 1 to 1 time intervals. hence a neuron may f i r e after repeated bursts of stimulation  none of which by i t s e l f is sufficient to f i r e the c e l l ; this is observed to occur in natural neurons. 
　　　also  in order to comply with neurophysiological data  immediately after a c e l l has f i r e d i t s threshold becomes i n f i n i t e   this state 
 the absolutely refractory period  usually lasts 1 to 1 time intervals. the threshold then decays towards i t s quiescent value  again it is convenient to assume an exponential decay with a 
typical time constant of 1 to 1 time steps. these points are illustrated in f i g . 1. 
　　　the connections from cell to cell are unidirectional and independent  pulses may only travel as output from one cell via i t s axon branches to provide inputs to other c e l l s   but there is no reason why if an axon branch of c e l l a is connected to c e l l b that an axon branch of cell b should not be connected to c e l l a . 	the connections are distributed according to some rule  normally a function of the radial distance between cells. 
　　　some feedback mechanism may be be applied to the network in an attempt to cause it to produce particular forms of output in response to particular inputs. mechanisms of the form if the required output is not obtained reduce the 
weights of a l l connections which contributed to the f i r i n g of cells and increase the weights of a l l those which fed pulses to cells which did not f i r e - have been used with some success. if inhibitory as well as excitatory connections have been used then some originally positive  excitatory  connections may become negative  inhibitory  by the use of such mechanisms. this has been the case in several models  but it is believed that this is not physically possible in natural systems  where a synapse appears to be always either excitatory or inhibitory. uttley has suggested that this d i f f i c u l t y may be overcome by postulating that there are always two pathways connecting any two neurons  a direct excitatory pathway  and an indirect  via an intermediate neuron  inhibitory pathway.

1 x 1 	networks 
　　　several networks were simulated and their performance examined on the atlas computers at manchester and harwell. 	the type of neuron programmed incorporated most of the features described in section 1  the networks being conceived as plane square matrices normally having a side length of 1 cells. 
　　　the cells were connected randomly with a given  variable exponential probability d i s t r i b u tion of connections  see f i g 1 . the number of connections per cell might vary from about 1 to 1 depending on the parameters fed into the program data. for each c e l l   for each possible connection either to every other c e l l or to a l l cells within a certain radial distance  a random number in the range 1 - 1 was generated  using a psaudo-random number generator sub-routine   if the probability of connection was greater than the random number produced then a connection was established between the two cells. thus the constant 'a'   f i g . 1  effectively controlled the number of connections per c e l l  for a given 'a*  and the constant 'a' the distance decay of probability of connection. the program was arranged such that a c e l l could not be connected to i t s e l f . 
　　　in many of these models the connection pattern for each c e l l was calculated and stored separately  as far as the author is aware in a l l other simulation studies a repetitive from of connection has been used. some later networks were constructed with a repetitive connection pattern and are compared with the previous models in section 1. in the 1 x 1 models only excitatory connections of fixed weight were used. a quiescent threshold level  to  of 1 was chosen  and a value of 1 to represent the i n i t i a l point  tm  for the decay of the refractory period. two forms of refractory period were used:-
a  1st. time step after f i r i n g   c e l l absolutely refractory 
1nd. time step after f i r i n g   threshold 
	- 	1 /1 to 
1rd. time step after f i r i n g   threshold - to 
b  1st. time step after f i r i n g   c e l l absolutely refractory 
1nd. to nth. time steps governed by the expression 
 g - 1  
	t ＊ to +  tm - to .el 	 1  
where el is a constant less than unity  g is the nuuber of time steps since the c e l l last fired 

　　　for type  b  temporal summation of excitation was effected by using the relation 

where e is the excitation level at time t  and e1 is a constant less than unity. 
values of el used were 1  1 
	values of e1 used were 1  	1 
there was no temporal summation of stimuli for type  a  networks. 
　　　the advantages of using a pseudo-random number generator were that the same sequence of s t a t i s t i c a l l y random numbers could be produced repeatedly merely by starting the generation sequence with the same 'priming 1 number  this enabled the same network to be set up on the computer on different occasions without having to read in the connection details as data; and also networks with the same connection parameters

 density of connections  and probability of connection distribution  could be set up and compared by simply regenerating the network using a different priming number.

which has not fired by the symbol 1. 
description of results - 1st series 
　　　1 x 1 networks of neurons were set up on the computer as described above  in this f i r s t series of experiments the inter neuron connections were calculated and stored separately for each c e l l in the network. the network was i n i t i a l l y stimulated by exciting three or four of the nine central cells with one of the patterns shown in f i g . 1. 
　　　the activity was allowed to continue for a number of time steps  usually 1 or 1  the a c t i v i t y was then stopped  a l l cells returned to their quiescent state with zero excitation  and a new pattern of activity i n i t i a t e d by stimulating the network with a different input pattern. provision was made to output the activi t y pattern in the network at each time step  or for the final few time steps. 
　　　the type of activity which occurred in the networks f e l l into one of five categories. examples of which are shown in figs. 1 - 1 . 
　　　1. attenuation. the connectivity of the network is not sufficiently 'strong' and the a c t i v i t y dies out in a few time steps    f i g . 1  
　　　1. unstable. the activity does not attenuate  but there is no discernible continuing cyclic pattern; at least in the short term    f i g . 1  
　　　1. virtually stable  a . with the number of time steps recorded the output has not satisfied one of the conditions 1 or 1  see below   but it appears probable that it w i l l lock in to one of these modes during the next few time steps    f i g . 1  
　　　1. virtually stable  b . the output pattern at time t is not identical with that at time t + 1  but is identical with that at some time t + n  where n is an integer greater than 1   f i g . 1  
　　　1. stable. the network produces an oscillatory output such that a l l cells which do not f i r e at time step t  f i r e at time step t + 1. a l l cells which fired at time step t are of course absolutely refractory at t + 1. the t t h . pattern is therefore the inverse of the pattern of the previous time step  and identical with the  t + 1  t h . pattern    f i g . 1  
　　　from an examination of the outputs typified i n f i g s . 1 - 1 several features emerge. 
　　　the distinction between modes 1 - 1 is somewhat arbitary and more one of degree than a precise division. those networks classified as type 1 normally only lack s t a b i l i t y in a few  say less than 1  'outer square' cells. in type 1 networks there is a more random variation  frequently some cells change allegiance; i.e. if they were i n i t i a l l y on during an even time step they may  at a latter stage  be on during an odd time step. in such unstable networks no two identical outputs have been noted over periods of 1 time steps  the exponential refractory period lasted 1 time steps . it is d i f f i c u l t to imagine that one of these networks if allowed to maintain activity for a sufficiently long time would not f a l l into a cycle  even if this were of many 
hundreds of time steps duration. an interesting feature of this type of network is the tendency for underlying patterns of activity  similar to type 1  to last for a few time steps  slowly disintegrating to form a new basic pattern which in turn builds up and then disintegrates - though a few cells may be common to a l l such transitory patterns. 
　　　the difference between modes 1 and 1 is presumed to be a lack of specific connections to a particular cell or cells  such that they only f i r e every 1th. or 1th. time step rather than every 1nd. step. it is also possible for a cell to f i r e every 1rd. time step giving a mode 1 output with a cycle time of 1 time steps. 
　　　the lock in time before a stable output was produced was affected by the type of input pattern used to stimulate the network. networks stimulated with patterns i and ii tended generally to stabilise more rapidly than i i i and iv type inputs due to their having a greater probability of two or more active connections to the same cell during the f i r s t time step. for example in patterns i and ii there are six cells which are only one unit distance from two 
stimulated cells  in i i i and iv there are only four such cells. in v there are nine such cells  but insufficient runs were made to satisfactorily compare the tendency of this input to stabilize quickly compared with types i - iv. 
　　　the lock in time is also dependent on the constant 'a' being shorter for large values of a. for sufficiently large a the network w i l l stabi l i z e instantly to repeat the input pattern 
unchanged in alternate time steps   f i g . 1 . this 'over connected' network gives rise to an interesting and possibly useful mode of activity which it is convenient to designate as mode 1 - the saturated stable mode. 
　　　to summarise  dependent on the network parameters the flow of a c t i v i t y in the network w i l l give rise to one of six possible modes. these are:-
1. 	attenuation 1. 	virtually stable  b  1. 	unstable 1. 	stable 1. 	virtually stable  a  1. 	saturated stable

comments on results - 1st series 
　　　the results of this f i r s t series of experiments raised several points on the behaviour of these and more complicated networks. many of these were in the form of a more accurate assessment of the variation in output with the various network parameters  e.g. 
1. what is the effect of the threshold/connecti v i t y strength r a t i o on the s t a b i l i t y of the network - perhaps expressed in terms of the lock in time and the period of the cyclic a c t i v i t y . 
1. a quantitative analysis of the effects of  a'  'a f   the length of the absolutely refractory period  the refractory period decay constant and the excitation decay constant on the network. 
1. the effect of the variation of input pattern sise and shape on the tendency to produce different modes of operation. 
　　　the most interesting form of a c t i v i t y which the networks produced was their a b i l i t y to give a stabilised output of short cycle length. as far as the author is aware this property has not been previously demonstrated. presumably because of the shortage of computing storage and time other workers have tended only to output the frequency of f i r i n g of c e l l s   or monitor the gross a c t i v i t y of the network. hence they may not have realised that the nature of the a c t i v i t y - even when they observed s t a b i l i t y - was such a fine measure of the input pattern. 
　　　the stabilised pattern is always characteri s t i c of the particular input pattern i n i t i a t i n g 
　　　the a c t i v i t y   f i g . 1   though it is possible that two different input patterns could give rise to the same output a c t i v i t y   but this has not been observed to occur. with a l i g h t l y connected network the output pattern for a given input pattern varies with the connectivity  i.e. it is dependent on the particular random number generator  b  used   f i g . 1 . however  when there are sufficient i n t e r c e l l connections a pattern may be set up which duplicates the original input pattern in alternate time steps independent of the particular connectivity generator. 
　　　this l a t t e r form of a c t i v i t y is interesting for it shows that a very simple network  having neurons with only excitatory connections to other c e l l s   can exhibit a useful memory function. the requirement is that there should be a large number of such connections but these may be made at random  the a c t i v i t y pattern being independent of the actual connectivity pattern. once stimulated the network is unaffected by additional excitatory inputs; the pattern once established cannot be altered except by inhibiting some of the cells from f i r i n g in a particular time step. this is so because every c e l l which is not absolutely refractory fires as soon as it has emerged from i t s absolutely refractory period. thus we have a mechanism which can be used to store an input pattern indefinitely and which is unaffected by subsequent excitatory inputs to the network. the network may be returned to i t s quiescent state by applying blanket inhibition over the whole network. 
　　　these networks therefore possess some possibly useful properties  in order to further evaluate these properties a second series of networks was simulated. 
second simulation 
　　　a major drawback to the method used to construct the original networks - calculating the connectivity pattern for each cell - was the large amount of computer storage which had to be allocated for this purpose  also causing a consequent increase in computing time. this was so severe that practically it was impossible to run the simulation for networks of much more than 1 cells  and potentially r e s t r i c t i v e on the number of runs which might be made to evaluate the properties of 1 x 1 or similar networks. accordingly a modified program was written in which a more regular connectivity pattern could be adopted  but hopefully have no significant effect on the performance of the network compared with the original model. a program of this type was essential if larger networks with inhibitory and excitatory connections were to be simulated. 
comments on 1 x 1 networks - 1nd  series 
　　　in order to evalute the performance of 1 x 1 networks various network parameters were varied in turn  holding a l l other parameters constant. there being several variables it is d i f f i c u l t to adequately portray the performance in graphical form. nevertheless figs. 1 & 1 give an impression of the behaviour of the networks. 
　　　it w i l l be recalled that the connectivity of the network is governed by the expression 
	y r  - a.exp -r/a  	 1  
where a  a are constants  and r is the radial distance between c e l l s   and that a connection is made if 
	y r  	x 	 1  
where x is a randomly generated number on the range 1 - 	1. 
　　　the form of a c t i v i t y sustained in the network as a and a are varied is shown in f i g . 1. 
for large a and a saturated stable a c t i v i t y  mode 1  occurs  as the value of these constants is reduced this a c t i v i t y gives way to the stable 
-i*1-mode  1   i n i t i a l l y with immediate lock in to the mode  and only one or two cells in addition to 
the originally stimulated cells f i r i n g in 'odd' time steps. as a and a are further reduced the following progression of activity takes place: the lock in time to mode 1 gradually increases  and more cells f i r e in odd time steps  when the lock in time is about five or six time steps and about half the cells are on in each time step  the activity changes to mode 1 with immediate lock in time. at this stage the mode 1 activity 
w i l l generally have a cycle time of six time steps  or occasionally four time steps. then the cycle and lock in times gradually increase u n t i l no purely cyclic activity is noted over a period of 1 or so time steps  mode 1. though in these cases the central 1 cells usually cycle with a short cycle time  and i n s t a b i l i t y is confined to the outer ring of cells. where longer simulations have been made these networks tend to have very long lock in and cycle times  the latter were usually a multiple of 1  which was the total 
length of the refractory period used. a very narrow band of unstable  mode 1  a c t i v i t y occurs between mode 1 and mode 1  attenuation . in this region the pattern in the central core of cells changes and the i n s t a b i l i t y is no longer confined to the outer ring of cells. though some repeated patterns have occasionally been noted in simulations of 1 or more time steps no tendency to cyclic a c t i v i t y has been noted. the activity in this mode is either a very extreme case of mode 1 with exceedingly long  probably greater than 1 time steps cycle time  c.f. reference 1   or alternatively a c t i v i t y which w i l l ultimately attenuate; a case has been observed where the a c t i v i t y attenuated after some 1 time steps. near the v i r t u a l l y stable region a c t i v i t y attenuates  mode 1   i n i t i a l l y activity lasts for a short period  as a and a are reduced this period decreases u n t i l the activity dies out immediately after stimulation. there is a gradual d r i f t of the mode division curves towards the origin as the number of cells i n i t i a l l y stimulated rises to half the total number of cells  but this effect is very slight for small numbers of cells i n i t i a l l y stimulated  the curves for 1 and 1 cells being v i r t u a l l y identical. a l l the mode division curves w i l l become asymptotic to the a and a axes  since for both a = 1 and a ＊ 1 there can be no connections to other cells  but for a value of one variable near zero  and a very large value for the other sustained a c t i v i t y is possible. 
　　　figs. 1 a - d show the effects of varying both the quiescent threshold and the maximum threshold following the absolutely refractory period for different values of a  a l l the graphs being drawn for a value of a ＊ 1. the threshold decay was controlled by equation 1. 
　　　as the quiescent threshold rises it becomes more and more d i f f i c u l t to i n i t i a t e sustained a c t i v i t y   when the connectivity is strong enough for sustained a c t i v i t y to occur there is a corresponding increasing tendancy for it to be stable  and the region  modes 1  1 and 1  of 
v i r t u a l l y stable and unstable a c t i v i t y becomes very narrow   f i g . 1d . for larger values of a the mode division boundaries w i l l move upwards and to the l e f t . in the same manner as f i g . 1  there is a gradual change from one form of activity to another  but the mode division boundaries are surprisingly clear  very rarely is a network found which does not respond in a manner 
which could be predicted from the graphs. 	in 
these rare cases where the activity has not been in the predicted group it has  except in one case  been of the form of the nearest adjacent region. 
　　　different random number generators  b's  have l i t t l e effect on the form of figs. 1 and 1  occasionally a network  whose parameters place it very near a mode division boundary  w i l l change from one mode to the other for different generators  but normally the activity may be accurately predicted. thus the value of ' b' used does not seriously affect the prediction  it merely adds the additional constraint that for certain c r i t i c a l values of the network parameters the activity mode w i l l be dependent on the actual network connections. 
　　　this second series of experiments has shown that the specification of the parameters a  a  t   and t 	is sufficient to predict the behaviour or the network  and that the particular random number generator w i l l usually only affect the 
form of the output pattern  as in f i g . 1. 
modified simulation program 
　　　the method of generating the connectivity pattern used in the experiments so far discussed is satisfying in that a unique set of connections is generated for each c e l l   within the same s t a t i s t i c a l constraints as the connections to other cells. however  this method is wasteful in terms of computer storage  and to a lesser extent time. therefore in the modified program instead of generating the connection pattern separately for each c e l l four possible connection patterns 
were generated; being the same as four arbitrary patterns which might have been generated by the original programme. each cell in the network was assigned one of these connection patterns at random  the connectivity thus being a compromise between the original connection method and a purely repetitive method. 
　　　a series of 1 x 1 networks was set up using this connection technique and the performance of the networks compared with the original net-
works as depicted in f i g . 1. 	it was found that the performance was in general very similar  but that tne results were not quite so consistent. 
with the original networks  given the parameters a  a  a network*s behaviour may be accurately predicted. in the modified system there was a 
far greater probability  perhaps 1 that the form of the a c t i v i t y would not l i e within the regional boundaries of f i g . 1  compared with about an 1 probability for the original networks. this is not altogether a surprising result  since if any one of the four connectivity patterns gives a 'poor' distribution of connec-

-1-

tions this w i l l affect about a quarter of the c e l l s   whereas the odd poor distribution in the original program w i l l have l i t t l e effect. however  within this r e s t r i c t i o n the second program gives a satisfactory simulation method. 
possible extensions of 1 x 1 networks 
　　　the s t a b i l i t y of neuron has been discussed by several authors 1  1  1  1  with the conclusion that either some f a i r l y complicated feedback mechanism monitoring the level of a c t i v i t y in the network and holding it within certain limits is necessary to prevent saturation. or  as was then not such a popular idea with neurophysiologists but is now generally accepted as being the case  inhibitory as well as excitatory connections are necessary. to some extent in a small network  such as the 1 x 1 networks  these 
mechanisms are unnecessary since the absolutely refractory period ensures that a l l the cells can never f i r e at the same time - unless they were originally a l l stimulated together  in which case the a c t i v i t y w i l l extinguish i t s e l f immediately if the excitation of a c e l l f a l l s to sero once it has f i r e d . alternatively  if the excitation is merely reduced by i t s normal decrement  the network may exhibit saturated stable oscillation with a l l cells on in one time step  and none in the following step. else  if the connectivity 
were strong enough to allow a c t i v i t y to continue but not to allow the saturated mode to occur the network would settle in one of the modes 1 - 1 . 
　　　these forms of activity only suggest possibly useful applications in a small network  in a large homogeneous network  one with the same connectivity function throughout the network  if the connectivity is sufficiently strong such that a c t i v i t y does not attenuate then the a c t i v i t y w i l l slowly spread throughout the network and w i l l probably set up modes of a c t i v i t y very similar to those in 1 x 1 networks  but with much greater lock in times. fig. 1 shows how the a c t i v i t y has spread through a 1 x 1 network 1 time steps after being stimulated with a three c e l l input pattern. 
　　　it is useful to ask at this point whether the form of stabilised output which is easily demonstrated in a small 1 x 1 network can be found to exist locally in much larger networks  without the a c t i v i t y spreading through the whole network as in f i g . 1. one possibility is that in addition to the short range excitatory connections so far postulated we add a number of long range inhibitory connections  thus each local area 
when stimulated is surrounded by a barrier of inhibited cells   f i g . 1 . in principle we may now construct a model with this form of connect i v i t y   stimulate a small area of the network and observe if stable local a c t i v i t y occurs. if this is so we may further note the number of such stable systems which can be operated in a given sice of network. it is not being proposed that distinct excitatory and inhibitory areas are set 
up in the network  but that the network is homogeneous with short range excitatory connections. 
networks with inhibitory and excitatory connections 
　　　using the modified program a small number of 1 x 1 networks with inhibitory as well as excitatory connections were simulated. the net-
works had a homogeneous connection pattern  the excitatory connections being precisely as described above. only one pattern of inhibitory connections was used  being common to a l l cells  again this was of the usual form governed by equation 1  except that no inhibitory connections 
were made to cells less than five cells distant. the connectivity constants  now denoted by a   a   and a   a   for inhibitory and excitatory connections  could be varied independently. 
　　　from the results obtained it seems likely that the form of activity suggested earlier - a stable excited area surrounded by an inhibitory barrier - may be produced. fig. 1 shows the a c t i v i t y in such a network after the 1th. and 1th. time steps. the a c t i v i t y in the 1th. step is identical with that of the 1th.  and differs in only four cells from that of the 1th. the 
network is apparently exhibiting mode 1 a c t i v i t y   but this activity is limited to one area of the network. the tendancy for the a c t i v i t y to concentrate in a horlsontal band appears to be a function of the particular connectivity generator 
used. with longer range excitatory connections  and weaker i n h i b i t i o n   pockets of a c t i v i t y may be stimulated in other parts of the network beyond the inhibitory barrier. in these cases a c t i v i t y w i l l presumably spread throughout the network as in f i g . 1  but at a much slower rate. no attempt has been made to evaluate the properties of the network in the manner of the 1 x 1 networks  or to i n i t i a t e activity in two independent areas.
