 
lawaly is a lisp program which solves robot planning problems. given an axiomatic description of i t s capab i l i t i e s in sorne w o r l d   she generates her own procedures to embody these c a p a b i l i t i e s . she executes these procedures to solve s p e c i f i c tasks in the w o r l d . hierarchies of subtasks guide the search for a solut i o n . in s u f f i c i e n t l y large worlds  lawaly has rout i n e l y solved tasks requiring several hundred steps 
without needing to learn from previous tasks. the times to s o l u t i o n grow usually about l i n e a r l y with the number of steps in the s o l u t i o n . 
lawaly is extensively compared to another robot planner based on a theorem prover.
