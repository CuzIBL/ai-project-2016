1. introduction 

     in design robot-like devices adaptable to different environments and performing different tasks  we must first of a l l enable these devices to perceive the information on the external world; in other wirds such devices must possess a r t i f i c i a l sensory systems. 
     the results of sensory systems studies in man and animals allow us to lay down some general principles of organization and functioning for such systems. these principles can serve as a basis for development of hardware analogs of natural aensory systems. among these principles the followinga should be mentioned. 
     1. the development of concepts about one's surraundings and one's own state the system usee the information delivered simultaneously by different senses  hearing  vision  touch  etc. . interacting in perception and processing of this information. 
     1. combination of sensory and motor activity  or the ability of sensory systems to perform active search of necessary information through appropriate motions  looking round  touching  etc. . the capacity of independent motion  eye movements  etc. . 
     1. multilevel organization of the sensory data proceasing which permits on the one hand  the lowest level detectors to of recognize the elementary features essential for the recognition of the object and  on the other hand  to discard the useless  nonessential infor-
mation. 
     1# a well-defined structural organization of the receptors-receptive fields.

     1. the variability within wide l i mits  of the sensitivity thresholds with the task and the state of the environment  illumination level  noises  etc. . 
     there is no doubt that for human beings vision is the principal way for perception of the information about the external world. hearing is essential too  especially in communication  speech recognition . other sense organs includingtouch  are generally considered to be less important. but this is not quite true especially for touch. perhaps of the importance of tactile information is under estimated. because loss of sight or hearing occurs rather frequently  while complete loss of tactile perception is a rare phenomenon and as a rule is accompanied by the loss of motor activity as well. in this situation the motor behavior is out of the question. because of this inseparability of motor and tactile functions we are inclined to consider the latter as some inherent property and therefore to underestimate i t s importance. 
     but in reality  in many situations  especially in performing minute and very precise movements  such as screwing nuts  assemblage of small mechanisms  etc.  the sense of touch is very important and cannot be substituted by vision. one can carry out such tasks rather easily even without any visual control. 
     the foregoing discussion makes it evident that design of manipulators capable of a wide range of functions requires coordinated work of at least 
three subsystems motor  visual and tactile. 
     but as a first step i t is necessary to work out some approximation of each of these subsystems separately. since  on the one hand  the motor control and perception of visual information are much more advanced than designing artificial tactile systems and  on the other hand  the latter is no less important  we decided to concentrate 
our effarts first on the problems of artificial tactile sense and form recognition by tactile perception. 
     the f i r s t objective in design of artificial taotile systems is  sensebi-

l i z a t i o n   of the protheels of e x t r e m i t i es. as early ae in the f o u r t i e s n.a.bernstein pointed out the importance of the s e n s i b i l i z a t i o n of lege prothesib. later s e n s i b i l i z a t i o n of a r t i f i c i a l w r i s t was suggested by n.wiener  1  and ofterwards by r.tomovic   1     these projects had were of t h e i r e t i c a l rathet than p r a c t i c a l importance. it was only w i t h design and improvement of manipulators that the a r t i f i c i a l t a c t i l e systems became a pract i c a l proposition. 
     there are now a number of devices for t a c t i l e recognition of the form. these devices f a l l quite n a t u r a l l y in two groups  devices for the recognition of the shape in the course of a single grasping of the object by manipulator or an a r t i f i c i a l w r i s t   and devices f o r active tenacious probing of the object by the sensitive element moving along i t s surface. 
　　　the f i r s t group includes the projects accomplished at the tokyo univers i t y   1     waseda university   1     h i t a c h i co  1  and some others. transducers of the  on-off  type were used in a l l these projects. the experiments show that even w i t h a very l i m i t e d act of objects  two types only  bars and cylinders  the rate of recognition is not h i g h   and even a s l i g h t change in the size of the objects can affect the results very strongly. 
     active f e e l i n g of the surface was realised by s.aida and others   1   . an a r t i f i c i a l finger w i t h four sensory ele-
ments of the  on-off  type can move along the surface that is being explored. in the case of the loss of the contact w i t h the surface a special algorithm of search s t a r t s . 
     by changing the coordinates and o r i e n t a t i o n of the finger one can obt a i n the information on the shape of the object. the authors of the project develop t h i s system as a part of a symbiot i c t a c t i l e - v i s u a l recognizing system w i t h the v i s u a l part playing the main r o l e . this t a c t i l e system per se does not seem to be very e f f e c t i v e   because it performs only random probing of the surface instead of purposeful search of i t s most informative elements. 

     an effective system incorporating the general p r i n c i p l e s considered above should  in our opinion  be corroborated by study of published data  and  1  i n corporate transducers which can detect the amount of pressure   i . e . of  proport i o n a l   type  which are much more i n formative than the  on-off  type;  1  ensure the functional i n t e r a c t i o n of the transducers  or provide an a r t i f i c i a l receptive f i e l d . thus we can  as it w i l l be shown l a t e r   organize purpose-ful rather than random search of the i n f o r mative elements of the surface. 
　　　it is well-known from d i f f e r e n t i a l geometry that the l o c a l description of the surface element can be given in terms o f i t s curvature i n different d i r e c t i o n s   passing through the given point by f i n d ing the so-called p r i n c i p a l curvatures. the algorithms  described below  are approximative implementation of t h i s mathematical method. 
     for the calculation of the curvature of surface in a given d i r e c t i o n it is necessary to have the data at least 
from three points belonging to t h i s d i r e c t i o n . a system of 1 transdurers  organized in a 1 x 1 - matrix estimates the l o c a l curvature of the surface in four directions simultaneously. having t h i s in mind we chose a 1 x 1 matrix cons i s t i n g of proportional pressure transducers to serve as an elementary recept i v e f i e l d . a special conductive polymer was used as a sensitive element   1   . 
1. recognition of primary features of surface elements

nondirected surfaces we distinguish a plane  sphere and peak .. vert ex  by the 
mean curvature  i.e. 
　　　　practically the experiments with recognition were staged only for the convex surfaces* butf if we pay attention not to the absolute values of alone but to their signs too  we can classify concave and saddle-like surfaces in the same process. the procedure described above is easily programable. but it was of some interest to realise this algorithm  to increase of the speed od response  by a special analog preprocessor. such a device has been manufactured and tested  1 . but the accuracy of the definition of the local types of surfaces was not high in this case. for instance  for the cylinder and sphere it was merely 1%. this result was partly due to the tactile matrix  which was not precise enough  but mostly to the low calculation accuracy. nevertheless we think that the principle of preprocessor detection of the primary features of the surface elements in the process of tactile recognition deserves detailed investigation. 
     computer implementation of the same algorithm gave a much higher accuracy. the results of the experiments with classification of the surface using a local program  for the  minsk-1  computer are presented in table 1. the average error for the 1 elements  presented in this table is about 1%. this accuracy depends mainly on the accuracy of the tactile matrix. using more precise sensitive elements can improve the reliability of the recognition up to 1%. 
1. shape recognition by simultaneous grasp 
     experiments with classification of objects with simultaneous grasp by a two-finger manipulator with two tactile matrices of the type described above were staged. five types of objects of different size were used: cubes  spheres. cylinders  cones and pyramids  1 . the orientation of the objects was arbitrary. 
     form recognition was carried out by a system of three units. two of these processed the information from two tactile matrixes with the  local  program and the third one compared the output signals of these two and classified the objects. a list of all possible objects and their features were introduced in the computer memory beforehand. experi-
ments with this program which was called the system of passive tactile recognition  sptr  has demonstrated that this system is sufficient for the classification of simple basically different obiecte. but for the recognition of compel objects this system does not work  to obtain more acurate results one needs either more tactile matrices  receptive fields  to grasp the object or an additional algorithm for active search of lacking data  or successive probing of the object . 
1. shape recognition by active touch motions 
     the algorithm of the recognition operates in several steps. a list of the objects to be classified and their local features must be introduced in the computer memory beforehand. after the contact of the tactile matrix with the surface of the objects to be recognized  the  local  program determines the local type of the surface element  the processing of these data leads to a hypothesis on a possible shape of the object; the feature is determined in terms of which the hypothesis should first of all be tested and an instruction is generated which dictates the motion of the tactile matrix  looks like move in direction and is displayed* because the interaction of the manipulator with the tactile system was not completely tasted  the tactile matrix was moved by the experimenter rather than by the manipulator. the tactics of successive touching the surface elements was developed on the knowledge of human way of solving the problem of determining the shape by moving with one finger along the surface of the object. 
     the above program referred to as a system of active tactile recognition  satr  was experimentally tested on a limited number of objects such as a sphere  cube  cone cylinder  pyramid of widely different sizes  e.g. cylinder sizes ranged from 1 through 1 mm . the recognition accuracy ranged from 1 through 1%. satr has confirmed the utility of this tactics whereby characteristic features are actively sought instead of probing the entire surface. fig. 1 shows the finger path in probing a cylinder and fig. 1 the computer-generated path. 
conclusion 

     the experiments carried out in our laboratory show that even with a rather primitive equipment it is possible to make a satisfactory working system of artificial tactile sensing for manipulators. we think that following basic principles may be useful 
     1.. using proportional transducers which are more informative than the  onoff  type. 
     1. organization of a group of transdusers in a unified sensory system of the tactile matrix. 
     1. organization of the process of active search of the most informative surface elements. 
     further sophistication of the system must include the improvement of the tactile matrix  complete automation of
