 
in recent years considerable effort has gone into understanding default reasoning most of this effort concentrated on the question of en tailment  1 e   what conclusions are warranted by a knowledge-base of defaults surprisingly few works formally examine the general role of defaults we argue that an examination of this role is necessary in order to understand defaults  and suggest a concrete role for defaults defaults simplify our derision-making process allowing us to make fast  approximately optimal decisions by ignoring certain possible states in order to formalize this approach  we examine decision making in the framework of decision theory we use probability and utility 
to measure the impact of possible states on the decision making process we accept a default if it ignores states with small impact according to our measure we motivate our choice of measures and show that the resulting formalization of defaults satisfies desired properties of defaults  namely cumulative reasoning finally  we compare our approach with poole's decision-theoretic defaults and show how both can be combined to form an attractive framework for reasoning about decisions 
　we make numerous assumptions each day the car will start  the road will not be blocked  there will be heavy traffic at 1pm  etc many of these assumptions are defeasible  we are willing to retract them given sufficient evidence humans naturall  state defaults and draw conclusions from default information hence  defaults seem to play an important part in common-sense reasoning to use such statements  however  we need a formal understanding of what defaults represent and what conclusions they admit 
　the problem of default entailment-roughly  what conclusions we should draw from a knowledge-base of defaults-has attracted a great deal of attention many researchers attempt to find  context-free  patterns of default reasoning  e g    kraus et al  1   as this research shows much can be done in this approach we claim  however  that the utility of this approach is limited  to gain a better understanding of defaults  we need 
1 	non m1t1nic reasoning 
　in order to define defaults we need to understand when can we  safely ignore  a set of situations when we ignore a set of situations consistent with our knowledge  our expected utility calculations will only approxi-
mate the expected utility of actions given ip such an approximation can lead to erroneous perception of the quality of actions  and consequently  to bad decisions we suggest that a set of states can be safely ignored if a reasonably good action is chosen even when these states are ignored consequently we consider a default  p -1 v to be  safe  if the action we choose when wc consider only -states is a good approximation  in terras of expected utility  of the action we would choose had we considered all  to implement this idea wc propose a measure on sets of states lhat captures their impact on the outcome of the decision-making process we accept the default when the measure of ipa--  is very small relative to that of we will show that the 
proposed measure satisfies our stated desideratum 
　our measure takes into account two factors the probability of the set and the utilities of actions on this set if the probability of a set is small  then it seems that we can ignore it however  if the utilities of actions on this set are extreme as in the insurance example above  then we might not want to ignore it on tht other hand if the utilities of all actions on the set are very close then all actions look similar on this set  so we should focus on the differences among actions elsewhere 
　the contribution of this paper is twofold first  it advocates a more concrete approach to the study of defaults in which a specific role for defaults is required with such a role we tan gain a better understanding of the semantics  formal properties  and applications of defaults second it proposes a particular role for defaults in our decision-making process and examines suitable formal semantics that fulfill this role thus we can understand tht implication of various properties of defaults in a con crete setting we can examine how such properties affect the agent's decision-making process moreover our se-
mantics grounds defaults in a well-established theory - decision theory thus  we can use the tools provided b  this theory when formalizing our intuitions about decision making it also provides common ground with other work that shares these tools in particular  we examine the relation between our defaults and statements such  if p  than a is an optimal action  that have been studied by poole  poole  1  we combine the two types of statements in one framework  leading to a rich knowledge representation language because poole's work shares the fundamental notions of decision theor   we can inte-
grate his approach into our framework in a semantically 
clean way finally  decision-theoretic defaults supply us with a method for compiling decision theoretic information into a compact form this compact form may allow 
for faster  albeit approximate  on-line decision making 
　we are certainly not the first to note the importance of utility considerations in default reasoning similar intuitions were mentioned in many of the early works on 
default and defeasible reasoning  e g    mccarthy  1   in particular  several works use expected utility consideration in evaluation of heuristic rules  e g    langlotz

arbitrary indeed  as we show in the full version of this paper  similar properties are satisfied by other measures as well roughly  we show that a' satisfies proposition 1 if and only if  n a  provides an upper bound  in a certain precise sense  on gn a   and  ' satisfies theorem 1 if and onl  if a  1  provides an upper-bound on pr b|a    b  for b c 1 we claim that a is the most natural member of this family

the last section showed how to obtain cumulative reasoning in our framework recall that preferential reasoning is denned to be cumulative reasoning combined with the or rule moat accepted semantics of defaults  in particular preferential structures and e-semantics  lead to preferential consequence relations is or satisfied m the two approaches we described1 as the following example shows  this is not necessarily the case 
example 1 consider the following scenario the agent is contemplating two possible investments he can either buy the stocks of company a  an oil producer  or those of company b  aplastic manufacturer the success of either investment is greatly dependent on changes in the price of oil if oil prices rise  company a's profits will increase however  since plastic is an oil by-product the cost of raw material for company b will rise and its profits will decline on the other hand if oil prices decline  company a's profits will decline and company b's profits will increase this situation is complicated by news of a technological break-through in oil refinement this technology is expected to decrease the cost of oil refinement  reducing the costs for both companies but it will have a more dramatic effect on company b by improving the quality of its raw material however this technology is still in early stages of development  and is not likely to have any effect on the market in the next few years 
　these considerations arc captured by the following  parameterized  decision theoretic setting 

if the agent accepts this default  he is likely to make the wrong choice  1 e   buy into the oil company | 
　in retrospect  it is not too surprising that or is not satisfied in our system the essence of or is reasoning by cases if when holds we can assume   and when  holds we can assume   then we should also assume 
when we know that one of these rases is true however  as noticed by kraus  lehmann and magidor  this rule might be inappropriate when we read the antecedent of the default as  i only know '  which is basically how we interpret this default   i only know   '' is not equivalent to  i only know

poole  1  introduces a semantics for defaults that is also based on decision theory his motivation is similar to our own   et his proposal is very different we now briefly review his semantics a default in poole's system has the form -~* a and reads  gnen evidence  do action a' this default caches information about the best action to perform when we get evidence  such a default is accepted in a decision-theoretic context  pr u  if a maximizes the expected utility over   that is

　poole argues that this definition naturally captures man  real-life defaults he gives examples of default statements that conclude what action to perform  such as  if  ou are in vancouver in november  carr  an um brella' he shows that his semantics satisfies several desirable criteria  such as non-monotonierty  specificity  and ignoring irrelevant information 
　poole would ultimately want his semantics to capture regular defaults  such as 'birds typically fly  however  these defaults have formulas as their conclusions not actions poole attempts to overcome this problem using the following idea with each proposition p  he associates three actions  these actions stand for assume that p is true assume that p is false  and do not make assumptions on p  respectively poole then represents defaults such as 'birds typically fly' as bird  fly1 he shows that under certain  rather strong  assumptions on the utility of these actions  he can give accepting conditions for defaults in terms of pr and u poole s solution forces us to examine utilities of actions of a specific form - making assumptions it seems to us that unless we have a good model of how making assumptions affects the choice of  real  actions  l e   actions in the world   it ls quite difficult to assess their utility morever  it is unclear whether such a model will satisfy requirements of poole's analysis our approach to defaults circumvents these problems bv examining the utility of the actual actions available to us when we face the decision vve believe this approach is more natural in any particular context we arc facing a choice between several concrete decisions the context describes the possible outcomes these decisions can lead to and their resulting utilities 
　in spite of this criticism  we beheve that defaults of the form are useful  and suggest that poole's defaults 


1 	discussion 
our starting point was the thesis that knowledge representation and reasoning methodologies arc better understood in terms of their role in determining the behavior of agents once we have establish this role  we can gain a better understanding of the methodology in question we examined one particular role of default reasoning 
focusing on this role helped us to determine desiderata that defaults should satisfy and to derive decisiontheoretic semantics for defaults that meet these desiderata given this role  we can motivate what conclusions are entailed from a know ledge-base of defaults but more importantly  providing a role for defaults is the first step toward understanding what defaults the knowledge-base should contain in the first place as our approach suggests  the content of the knowledge-base depends on the specific context of the agent his beliefs  1 e   probability  his goals  i e utility   and the actions available to him 
　our semantics grounds defaults in decision-theoretic contexts intuitively  this is because we use wellunderstood notions  1 e   probability and utility  instead of abstract ones  e g preferential structures  this choice allows us to relate defaults to other forms of knowledge in this paper we examined one candidate  poole's default actions we believe that knowledge is 
1 	non m1t1nic reasoning 
not  m general  homogeneous it is composed of various types of statements  and clearly there are interactions between these statements grounding these different types of statements in a common basis allows us to understand these interactions in our case  the interactions between poole's defaults and ours described in theorem 1 are not arbitrary they are a consequence of the semantics of both defaults in terms of decision-theoretic contexts 
　our definitions rely on pdcs - sequences of decisiontheoretic contexts these structures  which may not appear intuitive at first sight  should be understood as a mathematical idealization this idealization allows us to talk about very small quantities  or very big quantities  and in particular the quotient e  without committing to a particular value this point highlights an important problem in nonmonotonic reasoning as well as probabilistic reasoning what is a an acceptable notion of approximation' it is clear that setting a fixed threshold value is a crude way of denning approximation similarly  the use of hunts is also quite crude for example  we do not examine the rate of convergence nor do we provide a methodology for obtaining these sequences 
　of course  in real applications we can often set a threshold value below which things arc considered small enough to be ignored once we fix this threshold we accept a default when the expression in  1   or  1   is smaller than this threshold this definition approximates the notions we examined here in particular  it does not satisfy the inference rules we describe however  
we can reason using these inference rules and get conclusions that might violate the fixed error margin this pro ides a wav of getting  fast and dirty  conclusions such an approach has been applied in the in e-semantics literature  and recent work  darwiche and goldszimdt  1  indicate that such approximations might be quite useful a possible avenue of future research is to use this method in knowledge-compilation of decision-theoretic information  hennon et al  1  roughly  in this method  off-line computation will generate a set of defaults using some parameter e these defaults  and their logical consequences  will be used at run-time to ignore various possibilities  hence reducing the amount of time spent in evaluating possible actions as with any type of approximation  there is a tradeoff between the quality of the inference made  decision in this case  and the time spent on making this inference decision-theoretic defaults can be viewed at summarizing the information encoded in the underlying decision-theoretic context and may allow for faster on-line computations 
　our analysis is based on static or  one-shot  decision theory recently  there has been much work on decision making in dynamic environments  e g   markov decision processes  puterman  1   the notion of expected utility in these models is somewhat more complicated however  similar considerations of probabdity and utility apply when attempt to ignore various possibilities  i e   we would like to ignore a possibility if it has small impact on the quality of actions we later choose we intend to examine notions similar to default assumptions in the framework of markov decision processes and to use these result to provide fast and approximately opti-

mal planning in this setting 
　finally  we note that the approach we examine in this paper is not the only one for justifying defaults in particular  several recent works  pearl  1  boutiher  1  examine approaches to qualitative decision theory roughly  these are analogues to decision theory where defaults play the role of probabilities and analogues of utility  and expected utility  1 e   a combination rule  are suggested all of these approaches are descriptive in that they espouse a particular procedure for decision-making we believe that it is important to understand the nor motive foundations of such qualitative decision theory 
this involves finding reasonable 'rationality postulates'  in the sense of savage's  1  normative foundation for decision theory  that characterize these qualitative decision procedures initial results in this spirit appear in  brafman and tennenholtz  1   although in a somewhat different context such results should help us understand the consequentes of adopting a specific representation for decision making under uncertainty this type of investigation  which we are currently undertaking  should elucidate the tradeoffs between qualitative representations and quantitative representations
