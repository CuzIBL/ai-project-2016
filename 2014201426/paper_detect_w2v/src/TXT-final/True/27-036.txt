generating language that reflects the temporal organization of represented knowledge requires a language generation model chat integrates contemporary theories of tense and aspect  temporal representations  and methods to plan text this paper presents a mode  that produces complex sentences that reflect temporal relations present in underlying temporal concepts the mam result of this work is the successful appbcation of constrained linguistic theories of tense and aspect to a generator whjch produces meaningful event combinations and selects appropriate connecting words that relate them 
1 	introduction 
reasoning about temporal knowledge and formulating answers to questions that mvolve time necessitate the presentation of temporal information to users one approach is to incorporate the temporal information directly into natural language paraphrases of the represented knowledge this requires a method to plan language that contains not only tense selections  but aspect selections  and temporal connecting word selections this paper describes a language generation model that incorporates contemporary theories of tense and aspect and develops a new framework for eelecting temporal connecting words we explore the interrelationships between choices in each of these categories  and then show how individual selections models - one for aspect  one for tense  and one for connecting words - combine into a single interdependent model 
   our model is designed to operate within a text planning process that provides input in the form of a conjunction of two timestamped literals and their correspond

ing verb tokens 1 our assumed input is m a form that ib compatible with representations provided in temporal databases such as those defined by  snodgrass  1  and used in temporal logic programs information about time is manipulated in the form of temporal intervals as denned by  allen  1  1  these intervals are used to semantically analyze temporal connecting words and to augment the tense theory of  hornstein  1  bo that 
it applies to events that have duration 
　we focus on the mapping of the tunestamped input into a matrix  i e   main  clause and an adjunct  i e   subordinate  clause conjoined by a connecting word consider the following input form 
	 1  	fall john l1 1  a laugh mary 1 1  
this logical expression may be expressed in several different matrix/adjunct combinations including mary laughed while john fell  mary laughed after john had fallen  mary had laughed as john fell when the facts are expressed in the same sentence  aspectual considerations and the choice of connecting words become important the timestamp information enables the selection of tense  connecting words  and certain aspectual properties for the verbs of the matrix and adjunct clauses corresponding to these two literals 
   in this paper  events are allowed to have duration and are viewed m terms of a fuller theory of aspect through the use of allen's interval theory we show how constraints on aspect affect the final selection of aspectual features  and we analyze how aspectual selections can alter the meanings of connecting words and thus affect their final selection we illustrate the algorithm by showing the full set of sentences that are then filtered by linguistic constraints 1

　　a literal is an expression of the form p xit   i n   where p 1 a relation name and each x  is either a variable or a constant the timestamp u expressed in terms of a start tune and stop tune for each fact for example  the literal laugh mary j1 1  describes an event in which 
	mary laugh* for two minutes  	md 	draw john circle 1  
1  describes an event  in which john draws a circle for 1 minutes

   the main result of our wort ib the successful application of constrained linguistic theories of tense and aspect to a generator which produces meaningful event combinations and selects appropriate connecting words that relate them we distinguish between inherent and noninherent aspectual features of verbs and describe an algorithm that uses these features to select tense  aspect  and temporal connecting words for generated text based on timeatamped information 
   the following section provides background on linguistic theories of aspect and tense section 1 describes our extension of hornstein's theory of tense to handle not only point events but also events with duration section 1 describes the algorithm for generating text from temporal expressions and provides details behind selecting aspect and connecting words 
1 	background 
both aspectual and temporal knowledge are used for generation of natural language expressions that reflect temporal relations present in underlying concepts this section describes the representations used for these two types of knowledge 
1 	a s p e c t u a l k n o w l e d g e 
following  dowty  1  and  vendler  1   aspect is taken to have two components  one comprised of nontnherznt features  eg  those features that define the 
perspective such as simple  progressive  and perfective  and another comprised of maerent features  e g   those features that distinguish between states and events  1 non-inherent features are dependent on temporal context  thus  they ue not stored with the lexical item and may be controlled during language generation these are distinguished from inherent features  which are stored with the lexical item and are used for lexical selection 
   suppose we are generating a sentence from the following times tamped input 
 1  go john slore 1 1  a arnve mary 1 1  
these events may be realized in a number of different aspectual combinations b 
 1   l  	john went to the store before miry arrived 
	 simple  	 simple  
	 u  	john went to the store before miry had arrived 
	 simple  	 perfective  
 in  john had gone to the store before mary arrived 
	 perfective  	 simple  
 it  john had gone to the store before mary had arrived 
	 perfective  	 perfective  
the aspectual variations shown here are primarily a function of values of non-inherent features  i t   perfective vs simple  these feature values must be determined before the two events can be combined since 
mqne of constraint compilation and table look-up  thus eliminating moat of the orergeneration 
1
　　 we will see shortly that events are further subdivided into activities  achievements  and accomplishments 
1
　　 the term perfective refers to either the present or the past  pin  perfective  i e   it does not specify the tense  
1 	natural language 
this information is necessary for selecting the appropriate temporal connectives  e g   before  after t while  etc   
   regarding the representation of inherent features  a number of aspectually oriented representations have been proposed that readily accommodate the types of aspectual distinctions that are of concern here including  jackendoff  1  1  bach  1  comrie  
1  mourelatos  1  dowty  1  passonneau  1  vendler  1  nirenburg and pustejovsky  1  pustejovksy  1  1  1  pustejovsky et al   1  crouch and pulman  1  hwang and shubert  1  olsen  1  the current model implements an aspectual classification through the use of three features proposed by  bennett et al  1  following the framework of  moens and steedman  1  i d y n a m i c  i t   eventb vs states   i t e h c  i t   culminative events  transitions  vs nonculminative events  activities    and ＼atomic  i e   point events oj extended events  
   consider the two verbs ransack and obliterate these are distinguished by means of aspectual features  +d t -a  for the verb ransack and  +d +t +a  for the verb obliterate although these two verbs are semantically similar  the feature-baaed framework accounts for surface distinctions such as the following 
 1  	 i  	john ransacked the house every day 
 n  * john obliterated the house ever; day 
1 	t e m p o r a l k n o w l e d g e 
tense ib taken to be the external time relationship between a given situation and others  see  for example   bennett et al  1   for example  each event in  1  has its own temporal structure in the case of go  john went to the store   the event is associated with the relchenbachian basic tense structure  bts  e r s  which indicates that the event is m the past 1 consider each event in example  1  in the case of go  john went to the store   the event is associated with the bts e r s  which mdicates that the event is id the past the aspect of this clause is  simple1  as opposed to progressive or perfective  in the case of amve  mary arrived   the event is associated with the same reichenbachian temporal representation  e r s  and aspect  simple   since it too is in the simple past tense 
   ab for relating these two events  the approach adopted here is based on a neo-reichenbachian framework proposed by  hornstein  1  in which the btss are organized into a complex tense structure  cts  as follows the first event  i t   matrix clause  is written over the 
bts of the second event  i e   adjunct clause  and the 
    it is assnmed that the reader u familiar with  reichenbach  1  which postulates three theoretical entities s  the moment of speech   r  a reference point   and e  the moment of the event  the key idea is that certain linear ordenngs of the three time points get grammaticalued into six banc tenses in english the corresponding btss are s r e  present   e r s  past   s r e  future   e s r  present perfect   e r s  past perfect   s e r  future per feet  the s  r  and e points may be separated by a hue  in which case  the leftmost point is interpreted as temporally earner than the other  or by a comma  in which case  the 
points are interpreted as contemporaneous  

s and r points are then associated 1 the entire temporal/aspectual structure for this example would be specified as follows 
　tense is determined by factors relating not to the particular lexical tokens of the surface sentence  but to the temporal features of the context surrounding the event coupled with certain linguistically motivated constraints on the tense structure of the sentence in particular  it has been persuasively argued by  hornstein  1  that all sentences containing a matrix and adjunct clause are subject to a linguistic  syntactic  constraint on tense structure regardless of the lexical tokens included in the sentence for example  hornstein's linguistic constraint on derived tense structures  cdts  requires that the association of s and r points not involve crossover in a complex tense structure 
this structure would be associated with a sentence such as * john went to the store while mary arrives here  the association of r1 and ri violates the cdts  thus ruling out the sentence 
1 	handling events with duration 
hornstein's theory of tense  hornstein  1  assumes that events are points in time to extend this theory to events that have duration  we analyze events in terms of allen's theory of temporal interval relationships  allen  1  1  1 allen proposes that seven basic relationships and their inverses may exist between two intervals before      after     during  d   contains  d1   overlaps  o   overlapped by  1   meets  m   met by  m1   starts  s   started by  s1   finishes  f   finished by  fi   and equal  =  1 
　to associate a tense with an event that has duration  we first determine the interval relationship between the event time interval and speech time a bts is associated with the event if it preserves the relationship between the event time e and speech time s for example  if it is determined from a logical expression that the event e1 john went to the store and event ea mary arrived have both occurred in the past  then the tune s of the linguistic utterance is after the two event times  assuming s = now  for both e1 and e1  the only bts's that preserve the interval relationship between e and s are e r s  past   e s r  present perfect   and e r s  past perfect  in each case  at least one line separates event time e and speech time s  indicating that e occurs before s 
   1 in the general case  the association of the s and r points may force the r1 pout to be moved so that it is aligned with the ri point the ea pout is then placed accordingly 
   1  the theory of interval relationships has been used for a number of artificial intelligence and natural language un derstanding applications  see  allen  1  gal ton  1  lesperance and levesque  1  vilain et al  1  williams  1    
    the inverse of equal is equal  bo there are a total of 1 different interval relationships 

　the full extension of hornstein's theory to events with duration requires a more detailed analysis of the e point in the bts representation in particular  we require e to be divided into a start time es and a stop time ef  cotresponding to the times tamps in the logical expression we shall denote the interval as e f a second interval  actually a point  is defined as the current  speech  time denoted by s the time interval for a literal may be open  corresponding to a stop time of 1  or closed  corresponding to a stop time containing an actual value  given a timestamped logical expression and the current time  we can obtain a partial ordering over e   ef  and s1  and we can derive the temporal interval relationship between e f and s with allen's representation 
　figures 1 and 1 represent the full extension of hornstem's bts representation to events that have duration the table shows the mapping from events that are eidorr and gaasterland 1

aspect selection process 
as described in section 1  aspect is taken to have two components  one comprised of non-inherent features and another comprised of inherent features the task of selecting aspect  step 1 of the algorithm in figure 1  involves finding values for non-inherent features the final aspectual realization that is present in a generated sentence emerges from the composition of inherent verb properties and these chosen values the two aspectual features that are not inherent are  1  progressive vs simple and  1  perfective vs non-perfective together these two features define the perspective of a verb phrase when both perfective and non-perfective are compatible with the cdts both alternatives are produced we address the choice of progressive vs simple for the remainder of this section our method to select between progressive and simple relies on a set of restrictions based on work by  dowty  1  that we have adapted for generation of temporal information we have recast dowty'a constraints on the relationship between inherent verb features and the choice between progressive and simple as follows 
 1   1  if the natural language verb selected for a literal is inherently a state  -dynamic   then the verb mast be simple 
 u  if the interval for a literal is actually a point that is the start tune and stop time are the same  then the literal is considered to be - -atomic and the natural language verb for the literal most be simple 
 in  if the interval is open  that is  the stop time is unknown  then the literal is considered to be -atomic and the natural language verb for the literal must be prooresswe 
 iv  if the interval is closed  that is  the stop time is known  then the literal is considered to be atomic and the natural language verb for the literal may be simple or progressive 
the only case where a decision is not definitive is the case of closed intervals  restriction  iv   however  we can inspect the timestamps to decide whether or not a bteral depicts an instantaneous or prolonged process or event if a conclusion cannot be reached  then the default selection is progressive for present tense verbs and simple for past 
　in our ongoing example  1   both literals are associated with closed  past temporal intervals both verbs go and arrive are -atomic so information about the completion of the event is lost if the progressive is selected 
　 this restriction blocks the realization of an activity in the progressive  even though such cases do arise however  it is assumed that in such cases there is a process of coercion going on this point is discussed further m  don  1  restriction  1  1  dictates that the simple must be selected for both phrases  as in john went to the store before mary arrived 
1 	selecting temporal connecting w o r d s 
earlier in example  1   we assumed that an independent process would select the temporal connective between two sentential concepts in this section  we discuss this process  step 1 of figure 1  two pieces of information contribute to the selection of a temporal connecting word for a matrix/adjunct sentence first  the temporal interval relationship between the two literals provides a means to select a particular subset of candidate connecting words second  inherent aspectual features  e g   +dynamic vs -dynamic  and non-inherent aspectual features  i e   progressive vs simple  that have been determined for the individual literals can further restrict the set of possible connectmg words 
　each temporal connecting word may correspond to several temporal interval relationships conversely  each temporal interval relationship corresponds to multiple temporal connecting wordb in addition  the aspectual features of the matrix and adjunct verb can alter the meaning of the connecting word for example  the progressive perspective of the verb endows the connecting word before with the possible meanings    o  and fi in the following sentences  before covers all three temporal interval meanings simultaneously 
 1      mary was drawing a circle before john was writing 
 event/event  
 u  mary was drawing a circle before john was laugh ing  event/process  
 ui  john was laughing before mary was drawing a or cle  process /event  
 iv  john was laughing before mary was walking to the store  process/process  
since the matrix phrase is progressive  the adjunct phrase might start after the matrix finishes     or before the matrix finishes if the adjunct phrase starts before the matrix finishes  it might finish at the same moment as the matrix  fi  or after the matrix  o  the interpretation changes significantly if the adjunct clause

	1 	natural language 

a theory for selecting connecting words that is driven by a set of tables that associate temporal interval meanings with combinations of connecting word and aspectual values the connecting word selection is constrained by the aspectual values already selected for an event 
　the theoretical results described here are currently being used as the basis of an implemented system that generates language from instantiated logical expressions that represent the answer to a logic programming or database query  gaasterland  1  gaasterland and lobo  1  moreover  the approach is compatible with a generation module used for interlingual machine translation such as that of  dorr  1
