       this paper sketches a method of patternmatching and inference applied by a program called sam  to read newspaper articles about car accidents  state v i s i t s   train wrecks  etc. here is an example of a story sam has processed  which illustrates the depth of comprehension this method enables it to achieve: 
sunday morning enver hoxha  the premier of albania  and mrs hoxha arrived in peking at the invitation of communist china. the albanian party was welcomed at peking airport by foreign minister huang. chairman hua and mr hoxha discussed economic relations between china and albania for three hours. 
summary: 
	premier enver 	hoxha  	the albania 	government 
head  and chairman hua kuo-feng  the china government head  discussed china albania economic affairs in peking  china two days ago. 
quest io n-an swe ring: 
	ql: 	who went to china  
al: 	nadia and enver hoxha went to communist china. 
q1: 	how d i d enver hoxha and mrs hoxha 	get 	to china  
	a1: 	they flew to it. 
q1: why did they go to china  a1: enver hoxha and hua kuo-feng wanted to discuss china albania economic affairs. 
sam reads s t o r i e s l i k e t h i s by i n t r o d u c i n g a f r a m e - l i k e data s t r u c t u r e c a l l e d a script  when the f i r s t sentence is analyzed  and by f i n d i n g subsequent inputs in t h i s context v i a the expectations that are progressively aroused. the r e c o g n i t i o n process is driven by a pattern-match of the input c o n c e p t u a l i z a t i o n against a template stored in the s c r i p t .  sam works i n t e r n a l l y w i t h

i i . making connections 
       sam c o n s t a n t l y makes inferences during t h i s process  both to f i l l in events which have been l e f t out between the l i n e s of a s t o r y   and to

defense and monitored under the o f f i c e of naval research under contract n1-c-1 
r e c o n c i l e discrepancies between an input and the a c t i v e expectations. some of these inferences are i l l u s t r a t e d by the example s t o r y . 
       the process which interconnects events exp l i c i t l y contained in a t e x t is c a l l e d causal chain i n s t a n t i a t i o n : the answer to ql above  e. 
g .   depends on the information that a r r i v i n g in a c i t y must be preceded by entering the country the c i t y is part o f . sometimes a r o l e i n s t a n t i a t i o n inference is needed to specify an actor or object not e x p l i c i t l y mentioned: e . g .   t h a t d i g n i t a r i e s usually f l y t o f o r e i g n c o u n t r i e s . reference s p e c i f i c a t i o n is a standard inference 
sam makes: to decide  e. g .   that  the albanian p a r t y   can be the same as  enver and mrs hoxha . the time- and p i a c e - s e t t i n g of a story is also used: here  to i n f e r that the o f f i c i a l t a l k s probably took place in peking  on the day of the a r r i v a l .  sam i n s e r t s the phrase  two days ago  because it is arranged  by convention  to be reading s t o r i e s on tuesday.  
       other inferences are a v a i l a b l e to i r o n out small d i f f e r e n c e s between what was expected and what was a c t u a l l y r e c e i v e d   two of which are i l l u s t r a t e d in the s t o r y . sam computes immediate r e s u l t s of script a c t i o n s   e. g .   to understand that being   a t peking a i r p o r t   is a r e s u l t of being flown t h e r e . a r e l a t e d class of movement inferences s p e c i f i e s the probable means by which people and t h e i r possessions t r a v e l around. in the s t o r y   these inferences would be responsible f o r asserting that the hoxhas a r r i v e d in peking on some s o r t of commercial conveyance  l a t e r discovered to be an a i r l i n e ; and that t h e i r possessions  e. g .   t h e i r money  a r r i v e d with them. 
	i i i . 	conclusions 
       what do we b e l i e v e t h i s work has accomplished  f i r s t of a l l   we were able to define a computationally usable n o t i o n of c o n t e x t   the s c r i p t ; and to devise a computer program  sam  which uses a data base of scripts to achieve a reasonable depth of understanding of c e r t a i n kinds of newspaper s t o r i e s . along the way  several types of inference had to be incorporated to enable sam to make connections between the ideas in a s t o r y ; and to recognize successfully s t o r y inputs which deviate from the expected in various ways. these kinds of problems crop up in s t o r i e s of a l l k i n d s . therefore  sam's pattern-match-and-inference cycle provides a 
       model for one kind of processing a general story understander w i l l have to perform.
