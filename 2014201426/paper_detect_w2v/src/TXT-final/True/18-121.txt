 
     we discuss a methodology for handling uncertain information in expert and other i n t e l l i g e n t systems. this approach combines the theories of approximate reasoning and dempster- shafer. 
i introduction 
the construction of expert and other i n t e l l i g e n t computer systems requires 
sophisticated mechanism for representing and reasoning with uncertain information. at least three forms of uncertainty can be identified as playing a significant role in these types of systems. the f i r s t of these p o s s i b i l i s t i c uncertainty appears in situations where the value of a variable can only be narrowed down to a set of values one of which is the actual value of the variable. this is manifested by a situation in which we know that a person's age is between 1 and 1. the second kind of uncertainty is related to situations in which there exists uncertainty as to satisfaction of a predicate by an element. this is manifested by concepts which have imprecise or gray boundaries. a very powerful tool for handling t h i s type of uncertainty which also handles the f i r s t type of uncertainty is the fuzzy set. the t h i r d type of uncertainty is related to situations in which the value of a variable assumes can be modeled by the performance of a random experiment. 
     the theory of approximate reasoning  which is based upon the theory of fuzzy subsets and p o s s i b i l i t y theory and the dempster-shafer mathematical theory of evidence c1 are two important attempts at providing a framework for the representation and manipulation of uncertain information. in t h i s paper we b r i e f l y describe an approach to reasoning with uncertain information which is an amalgam of t h i s two approaches.
