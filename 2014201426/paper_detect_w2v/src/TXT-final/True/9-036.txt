this paper discusses human semantic knowledge and processing in terms of the scholar system. in one major section we discuss the imprecision  the incompleteness  the openendedness  and the uncertainty of people's knowledge. in the other major section we discuss strategies people use to make d i f ferent types of deductive  negative  and functional inferences  and the way uncertainties combine in these inferences.

1. introduction 
in this paper we w i l l discuss how to represent and process information in a computer in ways that are natural to people. this 
does not mean doing away completely with representations and procedures which computers have t r a d i t i o n a l l y used  but adding new representations and procedures which they have not used. 
people often store and communicate imprecise  incomplete  and unquantified information; they often assert truth or f a l s i t y in r e l a tive terms; and they seldom seem to use rigorous logic in their inferential processes. because of these conditions  people seem to have an almost i n f i n i t e information processing capacity  with inference making and 
problem solving a b i l i t i e s more refined and far more flexible than any existing computer program. 
how can we study these human capabilities in order to make our machines show similar performance  a combination of approaches is perhaps best. observation of people's behavior  introspection  some experimentation  protocol analysis  and synthesis of computer programs can a l l be valuable techniques. a recent paper  collins carbonell and warnock1  discusses a technique for combining protocol analysis with program synthesis as applied to t u t o r i a l dialogues. the synthesis directs 
what to analyze  and the strategies observed in the analysis are evaluated by synthesis  in a kind of feedback loop. we have been using the scholar system in this way as a vehicle for experimentation with natural semantics. 
before we discuss some of the major problems in natural semantics  we w i l l b r i e f l y describe the scholar system  since it is the environment for our research. a word of caution though: we are only trying to develop some insights  without attempting to be exhaustive. 	more questions w i l l be raised than answers provided. 	there are many observable things people do that we do not know how to simulate. 
1. the scholar system as an environment to study natural semantics 
in this section we w i l l discuss  very b r i e f l y   some pertinent aspects of scholar  a mixed-initiative instructional system. more detailed discussions are provided in carbonell 1 ' 1 ' 1 and warnock  carbonell  and

carbonell . two data bases are currently being developed: one is about the geography of south america  and the other is about the arpa network. scholar's knowledge about any subject matter is in the form of a static semantic network of facts  concepts  and procedures. this is a modified and extended network a la quillian 1 and has a rich i n ternal structure with a well-defined syntax. 
dialogue with scholar takes place in a subset of english that is limited mainly by scholar's currently primitive syntactic capabilit i e s . in t u t o r i a l fashion  the system uses i t s semantic network to generate the material it presents  the questions it asks  and the corrections it makes. at any time scholar accepts questions and requests from the student  and generates responses based on i t s semantic network  making calculations and inferences of different types that it has been programmed to handle. the dialogue is unanticipated  and is dependent on the student's responses  questions and requests. figure 1 presents a sample protocol of an interaction with scholar; the person types after the asterisk and returns control to the system with a second asterisk.

1. natural semantic information 	1 	the reference problem and context 

in this section we discuss some aspects of natural semantic information and i t s r e l a tion to a r t i f i c i a l intelligence. 
1 	imprecision or fuzziness 
imprecise language is an essential charact e r i s t i c of human communication. 	as 
1
lyons says    far from being a defect as some philosophers have suggested  refer-
ential 'impreciseness'... makes language a more e f f i c i e n t means of communication.  talking about a t a l l person or a blue-green object does not require precise specification of height or spectral characteristics. the imprecision may occur either in communication or storage. if we say that a colleague receives a large salary  we may or may not know the figure. 
scholar currently stores areas and populations in numerical form  but it can respond to the fuzzy question  is montevideo large   with a pertinent answer l i k e :   i t is not one of the largest cities in south america  but it is the largest c i t y in uruguay . here scholar has found two superparts  south america and uruguay  and then compared montevideo to other c i t i e s in each with respect to population. 
however  it is more common for people to store values that are imprecise or 'fuzzy'  
what zadeh1 calls ' l i n g u i s t i c ' variables. this is the case with values l i k e ' l a r g e '   
' r e d '   ' h o t '   ' r i c h '   etc. it seems to us that one must be able to store either precise values or fuzzy values interchangeably.  in fact  scholar has fuzzy values as well as precise values stored  e.g.  that the brazilian highlands has a large population.  furthermore  the procedures that act upon these values must be flexible 
enough to deal with either. 
1 	incompleteness  embedding  and relevancy 
imprecise statements are often motivated by incomplete specification. since a l l specifications can be refined  they are essentially incomplete. we store what is necessary  and even if we store more  we 
only communicate what is pertinent. scholar does this through i t s i-tags. if it is asked  tell me about peru   it only 
gives a few salient facts. 
further specification can be added by refining existing values. for example  instead of 'blue'  we can have 'navy b l u e '   
or 'quite dark navy blue'  etc. further specification can also be added by giving new properties with attributes somewhat orthogonal to previous ones. an example of this is ' t a l l man' versus ' t a l l   heavy man wearing glasses'. properties can be specified to any level of d e t a i l by embedding  an inherent quality of scholar-type semantic networks. 
somewhat related to incompleteness and relevancy is the reference problem  see olson 1    referring to a colleague  we may 'define' him as the father of jack and j i l l   or the author of that paper on selfreferential statements  or the t a l l thin fellow with glasses. we decide on some specification depending on the context  including our assumptions about the person we are talking to. people usually specify only to the degree that is needed. in this sense  every p a r t i a l specification is a   d e f i n i t i o n ' . 
the problem of context pervades natural semantics. definitions and specifications  anaphoric references  what and how to answer  a l l depend on context. furthermore  there usually co-exist a range of contexts from overall context to short-term running contexts. for example  at a given time  scholar may have the contexts south america  argentina and buenos aires  each with some dynamically adjustable l i f e . what is relevant at any given time depends on this contextual hierarchy  
a s t a r t toward making references specific to the listener is possible in a scholar type system by using i-tags  see collins  carbonell and warnock1 . the likelihood that another person w i l l know about any concept is roughly proportional to the importance of the concept  as measured by the i-tags  with respect to the overall context. therefore  it is possible to estimate the sophistication of a person based on the level of tags of the 
concepts he mentions in his conversation. this estimate than can influence the description one uses in referring to some concept. for example  to an unsophisticated listener one might refer to the  capital of argentina  rather than  buenos aires   because the i-tags for the concepts  capital  and  argentina  are lower than those for  buenos aires   as measured from a context such as geography. 
1 in the future we want to have adjustable contexts in scholar  so that it can talk about the arpa network  say   from a communications point of view  to one person and  from a programming point of view  to another person. what this entails is a temporary alteration of the relative values of 1-taqs throughout the semantic network. those concepts that are referred to under the concept  communication   such as message capacity  b i t - r a t e   etc.  should be temporarily increased in importance wherever they occur in the data base  for the person interested in communication. a correspondinq change must be made for the person interested in programming or any other concept or set of concepts. this kind of s e n s i t i v i t y to the interests and background of the person  and the kind of s e n s i t i v i t y  described above  to the sophist i c a t i o n of the person may be the two major elements in the way people adapt what they say to the listener. 
1 	closed veraub open worlds 
in some realms of discourse such as an a i r line reservations system  woods 1     a blocks 
1
world  winograd    or a lunar rocks catalogue  woods  kaplan  and nash-webber***}  there is a closed set of objects  attributes  and values to deal with. however  in most real world domains such as those faced by sir  raphael1   tlc  quillian 1    or 
1
scholar  carbonell    there are open sets of objects  attributes  and values. it turns out that the procedures and even the rules of inference that can be applied are different in closed and open worlds. 
the distinction between closed and open sets is one of exhaustiveness and not one of size. for example  the set of states  e.g.  iowa   which is a closed set for most people  is probably larger than the set of cattle breeds  e.g.  holstein   which is an open set. however  open sets tend to be larger in general than closed sets. 
the distinction is important in a variety of ways. for example  if there are no basaltic rocks stored in a closed data base  then it makes sense to say  no  to the question 
 were any basaltic rocks brought back   
but if no volcanoes are stored for the u.s.  it does not follow that the answer should be  no  to the question  are there any volcanoes in the u.s.   a more appropriate answer is  i don't know . furthermore  it makes sense to ask what the smallest block in a scene is or the rock with least aluminum concentration  but it makes no sense to ask what is the smallest c i t y in brazil or the least famous lawyer in the 
u.s. it would be an approriate strategy for deciding how many f l i g h t s from boston to chicago are nonstop  to consider each f l i g h t and count how many make 1 stops. but it would not be an appropriate strategy to consider each person stored in a limited data base  such as humans have  in order to answer the question  how many people in the u.s. are over 1 years old   within open worlds there are closed sets  so that a question like  how many states are on the pacific   makes sense whereas  how many c i t i e s are on the pacific   does not. scholar deals with this by distinguishing exhaustive sets from non-exhaustive sets. 
we w i l l discuss in section 1 how scholar begins to deal with open world semantics. the essential point here is that the w e l l defined procedures that are appropriate for a closed world simply do not carry over to an open world. unfortunately  most of human knowledge is open-ended  and so people have complex strategies for dealing with uncertainty and facing problems such as how to apply new attributes or values to objects where they haven't applied in the past. 
1 the true-false dichotomy and quantification 
the two-valued logic that underlies the propositional calculus and related approaches to inference cannot encompass natural semant i c s . the trouble arises because truth varies in degree  in time  in range  in certainty  and in point of view of the observer  when it is applied to real-world objects. we w i l l b r i e f l y examine some of the implications of the multivalued nature of truth for natural semantics. 
symbolic logic uses quantification to d i s t i n guish between the universal and the particul a r   e . g .   between  all men are mortal  and  some men have warts . but there is no allowance made for the degrees of truth as between say  some men have warts  and  some men have ears   even though only a fraction have warts and almost a l l have ears. people w i l l infer that newton had ears  given no i n formation to the contrary as with van gogh   but w i l l not infer that newton had warts. the inference in the former case treats the particular l i k e the universal  because almost a l l men have ears. the more generally true a statement i s   the more certainty people assign to such an inference. there just are not many universal truths to be found out in the cold  cruel world  and so people make the best of i t . 
degree of truth varies not only with respect to fu1zy variables  see section 1  and quantification  but also in other respects. the sky is blue  but not a l l the time. the yellow of a lemon is less variable than the yellow of corn  which sometimes borders on white. boston is cold in the winter  but it is not so cold from the point of view of an eskimo. nixon told us that he didn't know about the cover-up of watergate  but one is only more or less certain that he didn't know. what these examples are designed to show is that people are uncertain about the truth of any proposition for a variety of reasons. sometimes people seem to merge a l l the many sources of uncertainty together  but sometimes they can distinguish 
different aspects of their uncertainty with respect to a single proposition. 
scholar does not now have any means for representing uncertainty  but the natural way to add such information is in tags stored along with the i-tags. just as with i-tags  u-tags can apply at a l l embedded levels of the data base. because we have started on programming uncertain inferences  discussed below   it has become desirable to represent the underlying uncertainty in the data base as well  in order to evaluate how certain any inference may be. 
	1. 	natural inferences 
we classify human semantic inferences into four major types: deductive  negative  functional  and inductive inferences. the 
various types are discussed in somewhat greater detail in collins and quillian 1 and collins  carbonell  and warnock1. we do not argue that these describe a l l the inferential strategies that people use  but 
only some of the major varieties. each of the different strategies described is being implemented as a specific subroutine in scholar to work on either the geography data base or the arpa network data base. while we think that people have a large set of such strategies  the number is probably less than one hundred. therefore  despite the inelegance of such an approach  we do not regard it as an endless task to encompass the bag of inferential tricks a person uses. 
in figure 1 we have included excerpts from tape-recorded dialogues between human tutors and students to i l l u s t r a t e some of the more complicated strategies people use  and the ways they combine together. we w i l l d i s cuss the examples individually below. 
1 	deductive inferences 
there are several transitive relations that people use frequently to infer that a property of one thing may be a property of the other. these include superordinate  superpart  s i m i l a r i t y   proximity  subordinate  and subpart relations. 
of the above types scholar now handles only superordinate and superpart inferences  
which are the most common. for example  if asked  does the llanos have a rainy season    scholar w i l l f i r s t look under llanos and f a i l i n g to find the information there  w i l l look under llanos' superc {for superordinate   which is savanna  and i t s superp  for superpart   which is venezuela and colombia. a rainy season is a property of savannas and so the superordinate inference provides the answer. the superpart inference is less general because it is restricted to certain attributes such as 
climate  language  and topography. one would not want to conclude that the capital of massachusetts is washington d.c.  just because massachusetts is part of the united states. because most properties of a superordinate or superpart are only generally true  and not universally true  exceptions 
must be stored to preclude an incorrect 
inference 	 raphael1 . 
similarity and proximity inferences parallel the superordinate and superpart inferences  
but they carry less certainty. 	an example of a person using a proximity inference 
is shown in the l a t t e r part of the t u t o r ' s 
response in example 1 of figure 1. the tutor f i r s t said that a savanna could not be used 
1 
for growing coffee  but then he backed off this conclusion because of the proximity of the large brazilian savanna to the coffeegrowing region there. to i l l u s t r a t e a s i m i l a r i t y inference: if one knows a wallaby is l i k e a kangaroo  only smaller  then one 
w i l l infer that a wallaby probably has a pouch. we plan to add s i m i l a r i t y information to scholar in the near future  because it 
w i l l also be useful in making functional analogies which are discussed below. the recently added map f a c i l i t y  warnock  carbonell  and carbonell 1   which ties together visual and semantic representations  makes proximity inferences possible  but they are s t i l l a way off. 
figure 1 
tutor-student dialogue excerpts 
 t  there is some jungle in here  points to venezuela  but this breaks into a savanna around the orinoco. 
 s  oh r i g h t   that is where they grow the coffee up there  
 t  i don't think that the savanna is used for growing coffee. the trouble is the savanna has a rainy season and you can't count on rain in general. but i don't know. this area around sao paulo is coffee region  and it is sort of getting into the savanna region there. 
 s  are there any other areas where o i l is found other than venezuela  
 t  not p a r t i c u l a r l y . there is some o i l offshore there but in general o i l comes from venezuela. venezuela is the only one that's making any money in o i l . 
 s  is the chaco the cattle country  	i know the cattle country is down there. 
 t  i think i t ' s more sheep country. it's like western texas so in some sense i guess i t ' s cattle country. 
 t  and the northern part of argentina has a large sort of semi-arid plain that extends into paraguay. and that's a plains area that is r e l a t i v e l y unpopulated. 
 s  why  
 t  because i t ' s pretty dry. 
subordinate and subpart inferences follow a somewhat different pattern from the others discussed. if asked whether south america produces any o i l   a person w i l l answer  yes  because venezuela  which is part of south america  produces o i l . but one does not want to conclude that south america is hot because the amazon jungle i s . we haven't worked out the details of the restrictions on these inferences as yet. 
there are other transitive relations that are used to make deductive inferences but they are not as prevalent as the ones outlined here. 
1 	negative inferences 
negative information  such as the fact that men do not have wheels  is not usually stored but rather inferred. in a closed world this presents no problem; it is reasonable to assume that if something is not stored  then it is not true. in fact  
scholar currently would say  no  if asked  is o i l a product of brazil   just because o i l i s n ' t stored for brazil. but in the real world  the fact that something is not stored does not necessarily mean that it is not true. people seem to have complex strategies for deciding when to say  no  and when to say  i don't know . we are currently trying to develop these in scholar. 
one kind of negative inference now in scholar is a simple contradiction procedure. it relies on contradictory values stored with various concepts: for example  barren contradicts f e r t i l e   and demoncracy contradicts dictatorship. suppose scholar is asked  is the pampas barren   it would find the s o i l of the pampas is f e r t i l e   and since f e r t i l e contradicts barren  it would say  no  the soil of the pampas is f e r t i l e .   
there is an important class of contradictions that are not subsumed under the procedure above. for example  consider the question  is buenos aires a c i t y in brazil   the fact that buenos aires is not among the c i t i e s of brazil is no reason to say  no   because there are c i t i e s in brazil  such as corumba  which are not stored. but 
there are three facts that together make a contradiction possible:  1  buenos aires is located in argentina   1  c i t i e s only have one location  and  1  argentina and brazil are mutually exclusive. we can i l l u s t r a t e 
the necessity for conditions  1  and  1 : 
  1  even though portuguese is the languaqe of portugal  it is also the language of brazil   i . e .   language can have more than one location ;  1  even though sao paulo is in south america  it is also in brazil   i . e .   south america and brazil are not mutually exclusive . making an incorrect negative inference about c i t i e s with more than one location  e.g.  kansas city  or 
different c i t i e s with the same name  rome  new york and rome  italy  is precluded by storing both locations specifically  just as with deductive inferences. the strategy we have worked out in flow chart form to find different contradictions of this kind is f a i r l y complex. 
failure to find a contradiction leads to another kind of negative inference people use which we c a l l the lack-of-knowledge i n ference  collins  carbonell and warnock1 . example 1 of figure 1 shows the tutor using this strategy. the basis of the tutor's i n ference is t h i s : since he knows as much about other south american countries as he knows about venezuela  it is a plausible but uncertain inference that if other countries produced o i l   he would know about i t .  his conclusion was at least somewhat wrong  because there are in fact several other countries in south america that produce o i l   
though for those countries o i l is not nearly so important as it is for venezuela.  
such a strategy is currently being implemented in scholar in the following way: if asked a question l i k e  is o i l a product of uruguay   where no o i l is stored  scholar can look for o i l under similar objects  e.q.  venezuela or brazil  or objects with the same superc and superp. if scholar finds o i l stored with venezuela  say with an i-tag of 1  and if it has enough information stored about uruguay  up to an i-tag of 1  say  to know about o i l if it were at a l l important  then it can infer that uruguay probably has no o i l . the degree of certainty expressed in the answer should depend on the difference in i-tags 
between the depth of what it knows about uruguay and the level at which o i l is stored with similar objects. if scholar can find no similar objects that have the property in question  as with  is sand a product of uruguay   the appropriate answer is something l i k e  i don't know whether sand is a product of any country in south america . the lackof-knowledge inference is based on the assumption that the extent of one's knowledge 
is f a i r l y uniform for similar objects. 
	1 	functional inferences 
functional inferences are common in the dialogues we collected  collins  carbonell and warnock1 . examples 1  1  and 1 in figure 1 i l l u s t r a t e the three different ways we have seen people use functional knowledge: in quasi-calculations  in analogies  and in answer to  why  questions. 
functional knowledge  which includes knowledge about functional determinants and their interactions  is learned  just as is factual knowledge  and therefore is stored in scholar's data base under concepts such as climate or agricultural products. we would argue that the representation of functional knowledge should be in a form that different procedures can use. one problem is to find a way to represent such knowledge in scholar so that 
1 
it can be more or leas precise  and s t i l l be accessible to different subroutines that infer answers to questions or that describe the functional relation to students. 
functional calculations can be used in both a positive and negative way. one simple positive function now in scholar calculates the climate of a place if the information is not stored. based on the functional determinants of climate  which are a l t i t u d e   l a t i tude  and distance from the sea  scholar 
w i l l infer whether the climate is t r o p i c a l   sub-tropical  temperate  or cold/polar. a negative use of calculation based on the agricultural products function is shown in the f i r s t part of the t u t o r ' s answer in example 1. the functional determinants of agricultural products include the climate  s o i l   and r a i n f a l l . the tutor picked the lack of rain as a basis for a tentative  no . negative calculations do not require as precise knowledge as positive calculations. they usually only require that one of the functional determinants have an inappropriate value. 
like functional calculations  functional analogies can be positive or negative. example 1 shows the tutor making a positive functional analogy  again with the agricultural products function. there he thought of a region  western texas  that matched the chaco in terms of climate and r a i n f a l l   the functional determinants of cattle r a i s ing. since he knew that western texas was cattle country he inferred that the chaco might be as w e l l . a negative functional analogy might have occurred if the student had asked whether the chaco produced rubber. since the amazon jungle and indonesia produce rubber  the tutor could have said  no  on the basis of the mismatch between the chaco and those regions  with respect to climate and r a i n f a l l . 
a positive and negative analogy subroutine for scholar has recently been completed. it is a fallback strategy to be used if there is not enough information stored to calculate the functional relationship. for a functional analogy it is only necessary to know the functionally relevant attributes and their relative importance. then scholar looks to see if it knows any similar objects where the property in question is in fact stored. it t r i e s to find a match or a mismatch by comparing the given object and the similar object with respect to their values on the functionally relevant attributes. people frequently use such analogical reasoning  probably 
because of the i l l - d e f i n e d nature of their knowledge about functional relations. 
the last example in figure 1 shows the use of a functional relation to answer a  why  quest i o n . 	the population density of a place 
depends on an indefinite set of functional determinants: climate  s o i l   and r a i n f a l l are major ones but distance from the sea  the particular continent  presence of valuable minerals  a l l contribute in d i f ferent ways. the tutor picked one determinant that had a value inappropriate for a large population density and gave that as a reason. by contrast a geographer could probably write a whole treatise on why the chaco has a low population density. what we aspire for scholar to do is what the tutor did  that i s   to pick one or two of the major determinants with appropriate values and give those as a reason. 
1 	inductive inferences 
we mention inductive inferences here only because they are a major class of human inference. we have not yet t r i e d to program them in scholar since they occur mostly in storing rather than retrieving information. the generalization and discrimination processes underlying induction have been discussed in detail elsewhere 
 becker1; winston 1 ; collins and q u i l l i a n 1   . 
1- 1 	combining inferences and accumulating; 
uncertainty 
the inferential processes described can combine in a variety of ways. for instance  contradictions can combine with deductive inferences. scholar w i l l answer a question l i k e  is the atlantic orange   with  no  it is blue   because it finds blue is stored 
with the superc  ocean. also one functional inference may c a l l another. if the agricultural products function needs a value for the climate of some region  it could c a l l 
the climate function to compute i t . 
a more important way that inferences combine shows up when different strategies reach independent conclusions about the same question. a good example is example 1 in figure 1. there a negative functional inference  with an i m p l i c i t lack-of-knowledge inference  f i r s t led to a tentative  no  answer  but then a proximity inference produced a possible  yes  answer  and so the tutor backed o f f his earlier  no . when several inferences combine to yield the same conclusion  they increase the certainty of the answer  and when they produce opposite conclusions  they decrease the certainty. 
there are a number of sources of uncertainty in inferential procedures. uncertainty can derive from the size of the difference between i-tags in the lack-of-knowladge i n ference  it can derive from the degree of match or mismatch in a functional analogy  it can derive from the degree of predictive-
ness of the functional determinants  and as we discussed e a r l i e r   it can derive from the degree of certainty about the information stored. these sources of uncertainty may 
1 be combined to produce an overall uncertainty  see for example kling 1  . this overall uncertainty is important so that long. 
tenuous chains of reasoning are not pursued to their pointless end  and so that the degree of uncertainty in the answer can be 
indicated to the student. 
1. conclusions 
what we have tried to show in this paper is the fuzzy  ill-defined  uncertain nature of much of human knowledge and thinking. we want scholar to be just as fuzzy-thinking as we are.
