 
     the notion of * concept* based on funct i o n a l i t y of objects is defined and made use of in the context of pattern c l u s t e r i ng. an approach to p a r t i t i o n objects using a knowledge base is presented. a different class of concepts called conceptual transformers is proposed and i t s effects on clustering is looked into. 
i introduction 
     clustering is a process of grouping objects based on a similarity measure. conventional similarity measures are context -free and g e s t a l f property-independent in nature. a recent development to overcome such problems  is the measure  michalski 1 : similarity a b =f a b e c  where a and b are the objects being compared and 
e and c are the environment and a set of predefined concepts respectively. 
     here we define the term concept from the functional point of view based on the physical properties which imply the function. a knowledge-based approach to p a r t i tion objects is outlined. an interesting subset of concepts called conceptual transformers  which is an abstraction from real l i f e   is studied in d e t a i l . the effects of this type of concepts on the clustering mechanism is looked into. 
ii concepts and conceptual transformers 
     a concept can be recursively defined as follows: a  a concept is a p a r t i a l mapping from  either the powerset of the instances of the physical descriptors of objects  or the powerset of user-defined functions  to a domain of labels   b  a concept is a partial mapping from the powerset of labels to a set of labels. 
     observe that the above d e f i n i t i o n is an extension of  concept' given by winston  winston 1 . in the context of clustering  there is a certain category of concepts which cannot be treated the same way in which we view a concept as defined above. this class  co  of concepts  which in addition to satisfying the above defini t i o n w i l l also satisfy the transformer

relation r on co defined by the following f i r s t order logic statement: 
 1pc   1t     pc=1  a  t co  a    pc   t  t r pc '  t   i 
where pc is a set of pre-conditions which should be satisfied by a non-empty cluster consisting of one or more o b j e c t s   ' t ' is the time required to instantiate the physi c a l descriptors of the object/objects corresponding to the cluster satisfying pc using the concept t. pc' is the set of i n stantiated physical descriptors. 
     observe t h a t :   i   the concept t does not directly participate in the concept implied by the cluster  whose physical descriptors have been instantiated by t.   i i   the concept t which is a conceptual transformer with respect to pc and pc' does not prevent it from being an ordinary concept in another context.   i i i   t w i l l not be a conceptual transformer if the cluster does not satisfy the pre-condition pc.  iv  r only implies the p o s s i b i l i t y of pc' but does not say that instantiation w i l l occur   v  the usage of the transformer is controlled by the frequency of usage of the respective concept which the transformer has instantiated - a practical aspect.  vi  a transformer may be used to improve the quality of a concept or reinstantiate an aberrated concept.  vii  a concept need not necessarily be an element of a single transformation r e l a t i o n . it can also be an element of the composition of several such relations. 
     consider a kitchen knife whose cutting edge has become blunt. a grinder which has the a b i l i t y to sharpen the blunt edge assumes the role of a conceptual transformer relation  when over a f i n i t e period of time  it transforms the blunt edge into a sharp edge. note that  otherwise the knife should be in good shape  which is a part of the pre-condition pc. also observe that the grinder does not participate in the concept of cutting  though the grinder may participate in some other concept. i t s frequency of usage is controlled by the deterioration in the sharpness of the edge of the knife. the grinder may be used to either improve the quality of the cutting edge or repair an aberrated edge. 
     a cohesion forest is defined as a nonempty collection of n-trees which consists of 	concepts which have to be 	necessarily executed to achieve the root concept  	and a 	collection of q-trees which consists of concepts which improve the quality of 	the root 	concept. 	for a detailed explanation of cohesion forest refer 	 shekar murty and krishna . 	consider figure 1. the branches 
cd  ce and cf which correspond to marking  
cutting and erasing respectively together represent the concept ' w r i t i n g ' . in the case of shaving  looking and lathering are quality improvement aspects  whereas cutting is a necessary concept. hence this is represented as a q-tree given in figure 1. 
     consider an object  and the functions it is capable of performing. an object can be defined  from the functional point of view  by the instantiations of the physical descriptors necessary to describe the object. one or more of these physical a t t ributes may be essential to perform the function/functions behind the creation of this object. generally a large subset of the physical attributes may not be relevant to the function  henceforth referred to as primary function  of the object. consequently  depending on the imagination of the user  these attributes can be made use of in performing certain other functions   henceforth referred to as secondary functions  which need not necessarily be connected to the primary function/functions. 
     we i l l u s t r a t e the above with a kitchen knife. the primary function being cutting is the resultant of the edge being sharp  uniform and hard  generally metallic . due to the usage of a heavy metal in the manufacture  the object posseses a physical attribute namely heaviness. this physical attribute can  and generally is made use of to support several secondary functions including i t s usage as a paper weight  a hammer  though with a reduction in the quality of hammering  etc. 
     a natural question that can be raised is the p o s s i b i l i t y of ternary  t e r t i a r y   .   functions of an object. reinstantiation of the values of certain attributes may not affect the primary function of the object under consideration. if we can identify a conceptual transformer which does this reinstantiation and the reinstantiated physcal attribute satisfies a concept  then this object can be said to satisfy a ternary function with a transformer relation. the same argument can be extended to d e f i ne t e r t i a r y   . . . functions based on the complexity and usage of two or more transformers. consider a kitchen knife. the t i p of the knife can be transformed into a screwdriving edge with the help of a 
     grinder. thus  the primary function is cutting  secondary functions controlled by heaviness  and the ternary function is screwdriving with the help of a grinder. 
i l l functiqnal clustering 
     eventhough conjunction can be e f f e c t i vely used in describing objects/classes  michalski 1   most of the applications do not warrant such complete descriptions  as functionality of objects plays a v i t a l role in the environmental semantics. thus  implication which seems to be a better choice for functional clustering of objects is used to generate descriptions like 'cluster =  an expression of concepts' where 'cluster' is a group of objects and 'an expression of concepts' consists of concepts defined in the knowledge base connected by logical connectives  a'  and  and/or '  r  '  exclusive or . there is no need for having additional connectives in the descriptions of such functional clusters. note that and indicates that the concepts can be executed at the same time and exclusive or indicates that only one of the two concepts can be done at the same time but not both. further details of this approach and an algorithm to perform this clustering is given in  shekar et a l   . 
     let us examine the effects of a transformer relation on a set of clusters. the number of concepts at a higher level with respect to the cohesion forest increases. this can be i l l u s t r a t e d by considering the following clusters which have been generated with the cohesion forest whose simpl i f i e d form is given in figures 1 and 1. 
clusterl={brush soap water 	source knife  
pencil eraser} 
descriptionl:clusterl*  shaving  r  writing cluster={blunt knife} 
the description of cluster1 w i l l contain concepts implied by the knife's secondary functions  which we ignore in the present context. the existence of a grinder in the role of a transformer w i l l give rise to: 
clusterl'={brush soap water 	source knife} 
descriptionl':clusterl=  	shaving cluster1'= knife pencil eraser! 
description1':cluster1'   	writing 
note that description1' is at a higher level than description1  and descriptionl' is at the same level as descriptionl with respect to the cohesion forest. these clusters are shown in figure 1. observe that the arrow has a label corresponding to the transformer and the cluster/clusters pointed to by the arrow are bounded by a broken line indicating the fact that these clusters can be executed only after some time specified by the transformer. we c a l l such clusters as v i r t u a l clusters. observe that v i r t u a l clusters can exist at 
	shekar  murty  and krishna 	1 

both ends of the arrow. this is shown in figure 1. note that if tr and tr '   the transformers  are the same  then the tranformer may be viewed as a bidirectional conceptual transformer. a screwdriver is an example of a bidirectional transformer. 
iv conclusion 
     we have proposed a functional d e f i n i tion of ' concept'. two categories of concepts have been identified  pertinent to clustering : concepts whose presence is permanently required for the execution of the corresponding function  and conceptual transformers  which do not directly p a r t i cipate in the function. a hierarchical decomposition of functions of objects with the help of transformers  has been looked into. certain interesting properties of transformers and their effects on cluster configurations leading to v i r t u a l clusters have been explained with an example. 
	the 	approach suggested in this 	paper 
is different from conventional approaches  as it views objects from the functional angle. the resulting p a r t i t i o n is more in the abstract rather than in the physical sense  and such a grouping resembles our mental perception of objects. it should be noted that the above approach is pertinent to man-made objects as they are created from a functional point of view.
