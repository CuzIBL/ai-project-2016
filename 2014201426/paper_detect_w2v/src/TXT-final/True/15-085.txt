　　　using a one-dimensional linear scale to represent degrees of evidence for propositions  wahlster is not able to distinguish between 'some positive and no negative evidence' and 'strong positive and some negative evidence'  if the difference between positive and negative evidence remains constant. usually it is the latter which is not allowed  cf. wahlster  1 .

in order to represent  1  and to determine its 
ep  it is helpful to interpret ' i t may be true' and 
' i t is false' as indicators of evidence  where the f i r s t modifies the ep produced by the second. the very ' f i r s t ' ep ** is created by an implicit part of the given sentence. this part is a constituent of every natural language utterance - it indicates the relationship between the real world and the proposition and says that 
 1  in 	the 	real 	world 	it 	is 	the 	case 	that 
 proposition . 
　　　 a  is successively modified by evidence indicators until the evidence point of the proposition is obtained and the mental attitude of the utterance producer is adequately expressed. 
　　　i introduce ' i t is the case' as the operation that assigns  1  to a proposition pi.

i n d i c a t o r s   can be e x p l i c a t e d in such a way. 
	i l l 	inference r u l e s 
       in l o g i c premises have to be v e r i f i e d in order to show that a conclusion is a theorem. s u b s t i t u t i n g t r u t h values by evidence values we have to redefine the word ' v e r i f y ' . what could it mean to ' v e r i f y a premise' if the p r o p o s i t i o n s which could be supporting instances for the premise have eps but no t r u t h values  if we provide the premises w i t h goal p o i n t s  gp  ** then we can check whether or not the evidence point of a p r o p o s i t i o n matching a premise is i d e n t i c a l w i t h the goal p o i n t . if t h i s is the case  then the p r o p o s i t i o n is a ' s u p p o r t i n g i n s t a n c e ' for the premise. we can do e x a c t l y the same w i t h the c o n c l u s i o n : it gets a gp t h a t becomes i t s evidence point if a l l premises are 
v e r i f i e d 	in the described way. 
       at t h i s point the main d i f f e r e n c e between t h i s and the predicate c a l c u l u s is that in l o g i c there is only one gp   1   1     which is given i m p l i c i t l y . in 
my proposal each ep t h a t is possible can stand for a gp. 
       to make the system more powerful the f o l l o w i n g extension is made: a p r o p o s i t i o n is a supporting instance for a premise if it matches and if i t s ep is compatible w i t h the gp of the premise. in t h i s context ' c o m p a t i b l e ' means that the neighborhood of 
* usually the receiver of  1  expects the s o l u t i o n of the c o n t r a d i c t o r y s i t u a t i o n by the speaker.     i t i s d e f i n i t e that h e w i l l t r a v e l !     
** the goal p o i n t of a premise t e l l s us that the i n f e r e n c e r u l e is a p p l i c a b l e if the a t t i t u d e to a p r o p o s i t i o n matching the premise   i t s evidence p o i n t   is i d e n t i c a l to the wanted gp. as eps gps are p a i r s of values of the form   g p +   g p -   ♀   1   1   x   1   1   . they are elements of the evidence space t o o . each gp is defined * and that the ep is an element of t h i s neighborhood. now we can determine the ' q u a l i t y ' ** of the v e r i f i c a t i o n of a premise by computing the distance between the ep and the gp. 
       we can d i s t i n g u i s h between at least two kinds of d e v i a t i o n from the gp: it is p o s i t i v e  more c e r t a i n   if the gp is an element of the p o s i t i v e zone   f o r p o s i t i v e and negative zone c f . the f i g u r e   and the ep is nearer than the gp to   1   1     or if the gp is an element of the negative zone and the ep is nearer to  1  than the gp i s . in a l l other cases the d e v i a t i o n is negative  more u n c e r t a i n    unless the gp is i d e n t i c a l to the ep  of course . this d i s t i n c t i o n is a f i r s t attempt to take i n t o c o n s i d e r a t i o n the d i r e c t i o n of the 
d e v i a t i o n . 	* * * 
       the evidence point of the conclusion no longer depends only on the respective goal point but also on the q u a l i t y of the v e r i f i c a t i o n of a l l premises and the d i r e c t i o n of the d e v i a t i o n . thus  the gp of the conclusion is also assigned a neighborhood 
**** . 
       the goal point concept is a f i r s t step towards achieving a p a r t i a l matching of complex s t r u c t u r e s . with t h i s concept we allow a premise to have the whole evidence space as i t s neighborhood. such a premise is considered o p t i o n a l because it cannot be f a l s i f i e d . in c a r r y i n g out an inference the system should be able to d i s t i n g u i s h between o b l i g a t o r y and o p t i o n a l premises  because in strange s i t u a t i o n s w i t h l i t t l e time to  prove a theorem  the system should ignore the o p t i o n a l premises. to compute the q u a l i t y of the v e r i f i c a t i o n of a l l premises the o p t i o n a l premises have to be taken i n t o account d i f f e r e n t l y than the o b l i g a t o r y ones because of t h e i r d i f f e r e n t degrees of relevance. 
* the neighborhood is a sphere of the evidence space w i t h the goal p o i n t as i t s c e n t e r . the gp together w i t h a radius defines the neighborhood. 
** ' q u a l i t y ' is introduced here as a t e c h n i c a l term. 
* * * if the d i r e c t i o n of the d e v i a t i o n of the premises is seen as a v e c t o r   then the ep of the conclusion   t h a t i s   the d e v i a t i o n from i t s goal p o i n t   can be computed w i t h the vector c a l c u l u s . this p o s s i b i l i t y is under i n v e s t i g a t i o n . 
* * * * there are many p o s s i b i l i t i e s for computing the a c t u a l evidence point of a c o n c l u s i o n   e . g . minimum  maximum  or average of the v e r i f i c a t i o n q u a l i t i e s   and v e c t o r c a l c u l u s . it also should be possible to implement a s p e c i a l computation procedure for a s p e c i a l inference r u l e . 

       the second extension is the i n t r o d u c t i o n of the degree of relevance of a premise * needed to compute the q u a l i t y of v e r i f i c a t i o n of a l l the premises of an inference r u l e . for the time being we i n t e r p r e t the neighborhood of a premise as i t s relevance - the larger the neighborhood  the smaller the relevance * * . 
　　　the ordering of the premises should at least take i n t o account the difference between o p t i o n a l and o b l i g a t o r y premises - it would be f o o l i s h to prove a l l the optional ones and then to f a i l w i t h an o b l i g a t o r y one * * * . 
       a special class of inference rules has to be mentioned: those r e g u l a t i n g the dependencies between ep's. if a proposition is known to have a c e r t a i n ep and new information is added  then we are able to modify the - g i v e n ep using these r u l e s . ep's of c o n t r a d i c t o r y knowledge can be computed w i t h the r u l e s and stored afterwards together w i t h 
the d i f f e r e n t knowledge 	sources. 
	iv 	conclusion 
       several extensions of a representation schema for uncertain knowledge have been described. the extensions deal w i t h an evidence space for representing u n c e r t a i n t y   the goal point concept for r e d e f i n i n g ' v e r i f y '  together w i t h the concepts of neighborhood  d e v i a t i o n   and d i r e c t i o n     and the concept of relevance r e f l e c t i n g the r e l a t i o n s h i p between a single premise and the conclusion. 
　　　f i n a l l y an important point c u r r e n t l y under i n v e s t i g a t i o n is touched on only s l i g h t l y . as we have pointed out elsewhere  habel and r o l l i n g e r   1   we have p o s i t i v e and negative evidence for inference r u l e s as w e l l as for p r o p o s i t i o n s . this u n c e r t a i n t y must u l t i m a t e l y be expressed in the same way as the uncertainty of propositions * * * * . 
* similar to the 'evoking weight'   j o s h i   1  which r e f l e c t s the c e r t a i n t y w i t h which the conclusion can be i n f e r r e d from the viewpoint of one premise. 
** this is only a t e n t a t i v e s o l u t i o n because it is clear to us that there are s i t u a t i o n s in which a premise is o p t i o n a l but nevertheless quite r e l e v a n t . in order to represent these s i t u a t i o n s we have to d i s t i n g u i s h the neighborhood from the relevance. we w i l l do t h i s in a l a t e r stage of our p r o j e c t . 
* * * proposals on how to order premises for other reasons are given in kowalski  kowalski  1 . 
* * * * this view of u n c e r t a i n t y is d i f f e r e n t to the one of joshi   j o s h i   1   who does not d i f f e r between save r u l e s producing uncertain consequences and uncertain r u l e s  producing uncertain concequences t o o   of course .
