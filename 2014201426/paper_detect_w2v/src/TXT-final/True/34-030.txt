 
the following requirements to empirical prediction algorithms are investigated: universality  n o n - t r i v i a l i t y   and consistence. it is pointed out these r e q u i r e ments are too strong. some variants of algorithms in which the requirement of  consistance  is replaced by that of  the greatest s i m p l i s i t y   are tested. 
　　　analysis of process of problem s o l ving tasks by the systems  which i n v e s t i gators c a l l i n t e l l e c t u a l ones  shows that stage of prediction of new facts by using regularities discovered on set of well-known facts  plays an important part in t h i s process. 
　　　thus  in pattern recognition tasks a belonging of control r e a l i z a t i o n to one or another image is predicted on the grounds of natural r e g u l a r i t i e s observed on t r a i n i n g sequence between objects' proper t i e s and pattern name. 
　　　in chess and draughts programs  etc. a prediction block is represented by procedures of taking a decision about the most preferable move. in so doing the r e g u l a r i t i e s introduced by programmer or discovered by computer are usedj the winning move is that one when estimation function of such-and-such kind reaches the maximum value; in such-and-such situation from the l i s t p r e l i m i n a r i l y  learnt by heart  such-and-such move is successful  etc. 
　　　in programs intended f o r d e f i n i t i o n of structural formulas of organic molecules by their chemical formula and by massspectrum  the mass-spectra of molecules engendered by hypothesis generator are calculated with the aid of prediction block. results of t h i s prediction are used f o r selection the structures which should have mass-spectrum not so much different from experimental one. 
　　　a b i l i t y of making successful predictions is one of the most important features of any i n t e l l e c t u a l system. one can a t t a i n a certain object only in case when there is a p o s s i b i l i t y to foresee consequences of one or another actions. on t h i s subject von foerster writes that to survive is to foresee correctly the events in surroundings. inductive inference is the logical basis of foresight  i . e . method to search  given condition e  f o r hypothesis h  which is confirmed by surroundings s and is convenient f o r a certain aim . 
　　　in the last analysis  purpose of any empirical science is to bring to l i g h t the natural regularities between characterist i c s of observable phenomena  and to f o r mulate these r e g u l a r i t i e s in the form that could be r e l i a b l e and convenient means to foresee the new phenomena. 
　　　pact of foresight  prediction  can be established objectively and d e f i n e t l y . description of the event to be predicted is entered in protocol; correctness of the prediction is tested by course of f u r ther events. 
　　　especial importance of the stage  prediction  for i n t e l l e c t u a l systems and the p o s s i b i l i t y of constructive d e f i n i t i on of the stage j u s t i f i e s concentration of efforts to i t s study. this paper contains review of works on methodology and of algorithms of prediction of facts and events in empirical world. 
　　　p o s s i b i l i t y to predict events is based on acceptance of determinism concept i o n . denial of causal r e l a t i o n between phenomena automatically excludes such pos s i b i l i t y . one can i l l u s t r a t e negative position relative to any prediction by wittgenstein's opinion  that we cannot predict events of the future on the basis of the ptesent. belief in causality is 
prejudice. that the sun w i l l rise tomorrow is a hypothesis; in other words  we do not know f i r m   whether it w i l l r i s e . in the following we shall proceed from the b e l i e f in existence of natural relations between phenomena. predictions w i l l be made with application of regular i t i e s that are found in empirical data. discussion of necessary requirements f o r methods  sometimes  algorithms  of p r e d i ction w i l l be the main aim of our work. 
let us consider a number of concepts 
 .  empirical hypothesis  we s h a l l mean as a set of formalized notions about char a c t e r i s t i c s of objects or phenomena under study. one can speak about properties of the real world only by f i x i n g i n s t r u ments  p  which measure these properties. let a set of symbols o= {p1   r1...  pn } used f o r designation of instruments tnore exactly  empirical relations measured with the aid of these instruments  be s i gnature of hypothesis. 
　　　let empirical interpretation of r e lations measured with the aid of fixed collection of instruments  designated by symbols of 1   be intenslonal basis   i n t   of hypothesis.

an empirical hypothesis  affirming that certain protocols can be never obtained if  is true  and if the experiments are 
made with the given instruments over any finite sets of objects  and not only over the set  . the hypothesis  may be regarded as a description of supposed characteristics of measuring instruments  and the protocol pr as a record of results of measurements of elements of  carried out with these instruments* the hypothesis is supposed to be such that protocol   corresponding to the experiment made over the set  1 is admissible under this hypothesis  i.e. the hypothesis conforms to the protocol   . other-
wise we must state the hypothesis is refuted by this experiment and it must be revised as a wrong i n i t i a l information. it is precisely the case when our i n i t i a l assumptions concerning characteristics of measuring instruments are wrong. 
　　　　a distinct act of prediction  say is that starting from the i n i t i a l hypothesis  and using information involved in the protocol concerning elements of t a new hypothesis is pointed out  such that: 
　　　　 i  is in a sense more  or at least not less  informative than  ; 
	  i i   	is admissible for the h a . 
　　　　let from the f i r s t we know only that current in circuit may have any value from 1 to 1 amperage  and tension of this circuit is from 1 to 1 volt. then hypothesis  would regard any combination of mentioned values of current and tension as possible one. as a result of experiment over some part of electric circuit there have been obtained such combinations: 1.  u=1v  i=1a t 1.  u=1v  1= 1a ; 1.  u=1v  i=1a ; 1.  u=1v  i= 1a . using these results one can construct the hypothesis h1 interdicting  in contrast to .such pair  for example  as follows: 1.  u=1v  i=1a | 1.  u=1v  i=1a   etc. one can express in figure this situation. in such a case we shall consider the hypothesis to be stronger than the hypothesis e1   and write this 
　　　　the act of prediction is considered as successful  or true  t i l l a new set of empirical objects  such that protocol of experiment of kind mentioned over this set is not admissible for and is admissible for   is found. it is obvious  t r i v i a l act of prediction  i.e. any act of type    is always 
successful in this sense  being completely uninteresting. 
1 

　　　　an individual act of prediction has so far been concerned. as for method of prediction it is natural to consider it as a function f of type: 
of course  certain restrictions that a r i se from our intention to impart certain desirable features to prediction method should be placed upon this function f. 
　　　in  the following formulas of these requirements were given. 
1. universality. 
the algorithm would be applicable to any possible pair  protocol-hypothesis   
1. non-triviality. 
hypothesis resulting from algorithm work would be  at least  no weaker than the i n i t i a l one. 
1. consistency. 
let be one-one computable transformation of possible pair into possible pair 
such that hypotheses 	and 	are re-
futed or confirmed on the same sets of objects   i . e . simultaneously . in such a case we can regard as effective oneone translation of hypothesis and protocol into another equivalent language. it is natural to demand invariance of results of prediction relative to such effective one-one translations from one language into another equivalent one; i.e. i f   and 
then would be refuted or confirmed simultaneously. 
　　　　k.f. samochvalov has proved the theorem 1 that the only function answering these three requirements is the function f  constructing the decoder  i.e. function that brings into correlation pair with hypothesis h   interdic-
ting a l l protocols except pr corresponding to training sequence. it is clear  such a function f* cannot be means of i n ductive generalization or that of discovery of empirical laws. to obtain useful rediction method the requirements formuated above must be changed. very l i k e l y   
we have to reduce the third requirement of invariance of prediction with respect to formally equivalent ways of i n i t i a l data representation. for this reason attempts to construct universal  non-trivia l   and useful method of prediction presuppose acceptance of  goodman's approach   : one ought to prefer some languages to another ones i f   in spite of their equivalence  they differ on such criteria as  habitualness  and  frequency of usage  of the terms. 
　　　the work    very likely  may be a justification of widespread in science 
principle of  simplicity   1  . according to this principle  from two theories equally well-conformed to known fact one along with research of requirements to empirical prediction algorithms  some variants of algorithms in which the requirement of  consistance  is replaced by that of  the greatest simplisity  axe tested. one of much algorithms is as f o l i o ing  : 
　　　　1. let be the protocol of experiment over the f i n i t e set of empirical objects. 
let be the i n i t i a l hypothesis. 
　　　　suppose we are interested in prediction concerning the new objects on the grounds of more strong hypothesis h ; . such prediction is equivalent to choice of one protocol pr   having cardinal from a l l protocols having the same cardinal  which conform to hypothesis 
　　　　we usually know something about new empirical objects. we want to predict the values of some empirical relations let subprotocol describing the set these relations be e : 
e = 
　　　　1. to predict subprotocol e we construct  generate  a l l protocols having cardinal such that: 
a  each of them conforms to hypothe-
sis 
for each of them the set e is i t s 
own subset. 
　　　　1. we shorten obtained l i s t of protocols as follows: 
a  for every protocol from the 
l i s t we find the subprotocol pr that contains a l l non-isomorphic subprotocols having cardinal k.  number k is equal to the number of calling the point 1  so that  for example  in the f i r s t t i me k=1. in the second k=1  and so b; we choose the subprotocols 
having minimum cardinal  i.e. 
　　　c  we eliminate from the  and from further discussion  a l l those protocols pr the subprotocols pr of which have cardinal more than n ntn 
　　　1. if in carrying out the step 1 we eliminated from the l i s t if only one pro-
tocol  and if remaining l i s t consists of more than one protocol  we pass on to recarrying out of step j. 
　　　1. the remaining set of protocols together with a l l isomorphic to them corresponds to the hypothesis h sought. 
　　　clearly  the step 1 provides the requirement of non-triviality for the algorithm. at the same time it is the formalization of the hypothesis of  simplicity  in accordance with which from two r i val hypotheses the one that is based on regularity  observable on the lesser number of objects  w i l l predict more  successfully . 
　　　　the examination of algorithms of such types was carried out on the tasks of d i scovering regularities in empirical tables of different kinds. the examples of such problems follow. 
　　　　 the ohm's law   tains predicate symbol 

ought to use more  simple  one to predict new events. . their interpretation is as follows.
