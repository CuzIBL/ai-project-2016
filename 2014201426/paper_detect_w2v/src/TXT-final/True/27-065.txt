 
we study a bimodal nonmonotonic logic mbnf suggested in  lifschitz  1  as a generalization 
of a number of nonmonotonic formalisms we show first that it is equivalent to a certain nonmodal system involving rules of a special kind next  it is shown that the latter admits a modal representation that uses only one modal opera tor the operator of belief moreover  under this translation the models of mbnf correspond to ''expansions of the associated modal nonmonotonic logic finally we show that  as far as such 
models are concerned  mbnf is redunhle to nonmodal default consequence relations from  bochman  1  these results have general consequences concerning relationship between different formalizations of nonmonotonic reasoning 
i n t r o d u c t i o n 
in many respects the logic of belief and negation as fail ure  mbnf  suggested in  lifschitz 1  can be seen as a most general formalism for nonmonotonic reasoning that provides a unifying framework both for logic pro-
gramming and for such nonmonotonic systems as default and autoepistemic logic in this paper we consider the relation of mbnf to other nonmonotonic formalisms our main results are twofold on the one hand  mbnf is shown to be reducible to usual unimodal nonmono tonic logics on the other hand we also show that it 
can be reduced to nonmodal default consequence relations from  boohman  1  
j he paper is organized as follows we show first that 
mbnf is equivalent to a certain nonmodal system called a bnf-consequence relation that involves rules or sequents of a special kind in this framework we define a counterpart of lifschitz models and the notion of an l-expansion that can be cor odered as their 'core' in addition we introduce the notion of  in l-extension that also turns out to correspond to well known objects from other nonmonotonic formalisms next we show that bnf-consequence relations admit a modal representation that uses only one modal operator the operator of 
belief 	moreover 	under this translation  l-expansions

　in the literature on modal logics one can meet two commonly used notions of modal consequence that reflect two main notions of validity of propositions with respect to possible world models let s be a normal modal logic a proposition a is called a local s-consequence of a set of propositions u  notation  if a is provable 
from u and theorems of ′ using modus ponens only a is called a global s consequence of u  notation if a is provable from u and theorems of s using modus ponens and the necessitatis rule 1/la in this study we will extensively use both these notions 
theorem 1 let  be the least nontrtvial coherent conseqvence relation containing a set of sequents s and s the set of ummodal formulas corresponding to sequents from s then a sequent s belongs to for any normal modal logic s between 
　here kd1g denotes a modal logic corresponding to kripke frames with transitive and directional accessibility relations  see  bull and segerherg  1   while kdai is a logic introduced in  bochman  1  it is determined b  directional knpke frames of depth 1 
　the theorem shows that the above ummodal translation is adequate for a representation of rohtrent bnf consequence relations consequently  it is adequate for capturing th - nonmonotonic mbnf-infcrence based on lifschitz models note  however that the translation itself does not depend on l-models and is adequate fnr any notion definable in terms uf  coherent  bnf consequence relations for example using the results from  bochman  1   sets u satisfying the condition  can be shown to correspond to ob-
jective subsets of stable sets containing s  while sets satisf ing  correspond to moore's stable 
expansions of s 
remark using the above results  we can perform a two-step translation of mbnf-formulas into ummodal ones  we first reduce an mbnf-formula to a flat one and then replace all occurrences of not in it by b- b note  however  that this procedure cannot be shortened to a direct replacement of 'not in mbnf-formulas since the above ummodal translation does not account for the interaction between nested modal operators of mbnf c onsequently it is inadequate if applied to non flat mbnf-formulas 
　thus  we have shown  in effect that mbnf can be returned to the family of usual modal nonmonotonic logics in the next section we will complete the picture by demonstrating that  under this reformulation  l-expansions correspond to modal s-expansions in the sense of  marek et a/  1  
1 	biconsequence relations and l-expansions 
bnf-sequents of the form  will be called  sequents such sequents correspond to modalized mbnf-formulas in which any propositional atom occurs in the scope of some modal operator note that all current applications of mbnf  see e g    inoue and sakama  1  lifschitz and woo  1  lifschitz and schwarz  1   use only formulas of this kind 
　let us rewrite as rules of a new kind as follows a sequent will correspond to a rule 
　we will call these rules bisequents such rules can be seen as representing entailment relations between pairs of sets of propositions in accordance with the original interpretation of blvf-sequents  bisequents can be read as follows  if all propositions from a are believed and all propositions from d are negated by failure  then either one of the propositions from b should be believed or one of tht propositions from c should be negated b  failure this interpretation also justifies the particular order of the four parameters chosen for representing the rule--
definition 1 a set of bisequents will be called a b1 consequence relation if it satisifies the following condi tions and rules 

　it is eas  to see that the abovt conditions are sim ply reformulations of the corresponding conditions for bnf-consequence relations note that by theorem 1 1-btquents are determined by bitheories only accords ingly  models of a. biconsequence relation can be defined 
as pairs  u i  such that 	then we have 
theorem 1 ifw-isa biconsequence relation then d iff for any model  u  v  if a u and b c t 
then either 
　clearly  an  bnf-consequence relation contains a biconsequence sub-relation that is determined by its bithe-
ones moreover  these biconsequence subrt lations can be ihown to be conservative in the sense that thev prove all 
and only -sequents that are provable in tht correspond ing bnf-consequence relation 
　instead of l-models we now have only it-expansions defined as sets u such that  u u  is a b-minmial model while l-extensions are defined as minimal modi is then it is easy to see that l-expansions and i extensions of a bnf-consequence relation coincide with the corresponding objects of the associated biconsequence relation 
　the conditions of coherence strong coherence and nontnviality can be immediately transferred to bicon sequence relations  since they are formulated in terms of sequents   as before  they will preserve i-expansions moreover  in this case the latter can he characterized as sets satisfying

　such an interpretation corresponds in fact  to that used in  lifschitz  1  lin and shoham  1  for representing default logic if  is strongly coherent is what is called in  bochman 1  a reflexive default consequence relation the latter has been shown to he adequate for representing default logic  reiter 1   where extensions correspond to sets satisfying the condition  now we have 
t h e o r e m 1 /f  is a strongly coherent bnf consequence relation then  is a reflexive default consequence relation moreover consistent extensions of coincide with l extensions of 
   1 he reader may notice an apparent discrepancy be tween the above two representation results especially if compared with the relevant results from  lifschilz 1 lin and shoham 1  where extensions vvere actually shown to correspond to l-expansions as well as with the results from  truszczynski 1a 1b  about im-biddmg of default logic into modal nonmonotonic logics where exensions were shown to correspond to sexpansions1 this discrepancy reveals an important though subtle general point about the correspondence between existing nonmonotonic formalisms 
   the above mentioned results may. cricle an impres sion of a broad equivalence between the relevant objects from different nonmonotonic formalisms 1 his lmpression can even be strengthened with lheorm 1  1 above that establishes a correspondence between l-expansions in mbnf and s-expansions in modal nonmonotonic logics as well as with the result from  bochman 1  saving that s-expansions can be characterized d precisely as extensions of modal default consequence relations still the impression is slightly misleading in fact as far as only objective propositions are concerned there are two kinds of nonmonotonic objects here one kind includes i expansions of m b n f and objective kernels of s-expansions of modal nonmonotonic logics the other more specific  kind includes extensions of default logic objective subsets of ground s-expansions and s-extensions  cf theorem 1 above and  bochman 
1   the difference between these two kinds of objects can be easily demonstrated if we notice for exam ple that an l-expansion can be a subset of anothtr lexpansion  which is impossible e g for  l- extensions 
   the following general result  cf also  lifschitz and woo  1   sh ows that the distinct ion is due to the presence of positive orrurences of not in mbnf-formulas 
t h e o r e m 1 let i  the least bnf consequence relation containing a set s of bnf-sequents of the form 
	then any 	l.-expansion 	of  is an l extension 
   this result implies in particular that truszczynski's translation of default theories generates only modal theories all expansions of which are ground such a translation is not reversible-objective subsets of expansions are not representable  in general  as extensions of some default theory 
1
　　note that the translation used by truszczynski is actually a special case of the unimodal translation given above finally note that the following definition 

also determines  a default consequence relation this consequence relation involves bnf-sequents that are responsible for world components of l-models in the sense that  if u is an l expansion then  if and only if 
　thus the main conclusion that can be made from the above results is that default consequence relations arc sufficiently expressive to capture the major nonmonotonic objects of m b n f in this sense m b n f is reducible to the former 
1 	conclusions 
 i his study can be seen as a contribution to a  future   general theory of nonmonotonic reasoning  . orrespondencies established between logic programming default logic and various modal nonmonotonic logics including those  statt d above strongly indicate that all these formalisms give rise to essentially the same nonmonotonic constructions moreover our results show that the rorre spondence between ihese formalisms can be extended to the h vcl of underlying reasoning systems and hence does not depend on particular nonmonotonic objects chosen 
   among other nonmonotonic systems  m b n f is clearlv one of the most expressive formalisms: more ov  r a.s we have seen  it is even loo powerful in lis expressive capa bililies for the objects considered a& its intended models however tilt list of piausiblf nonmonotonic objeets is by no means closed and there are indications that this framework or its fragments  such as bicousequence n-la tion& introduced above   could be appropriate for inanv of them however this is a subject for another studv
