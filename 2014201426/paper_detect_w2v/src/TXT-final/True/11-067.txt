 
　　the jazz musician has two problems. the f i r s t is the creation of melodic material. the second is the problem of f i t t i n g the melodic material i n to a particular harmonic structure. the work described in this paper concentrates on this second problem. to solve the problem we utilized a harmonic theory which allowed the identificat i o n of key centers and the assignment of functional meaning to chords. from this we constructed scales that were compatible with the analyzed harmonic structure. these scales were then used to translate abstract melodic material into sequences of notes that sound compatible with the background chords. 
introduction 
　　the eventual goal of the work described here is to produce jazz improvisations by computer. the computer's input w i l l be a piano score of a particular song. the output w i l l be a set of jazz variations on the original melody represented as a standard music score. this problem bears close resemblance to musical composition but there are two important differences. the jazz variations should be reminiscent in character to the original 
melody and they must f i t with the harmonic structure of the original piano score. these two cons t r a i n t s define a problem which is significantly different from that of composition in general. that it is a practical and non-trivial problem can be attested to by any practicing jazz musician. 
　　the work described here concentrates on the problem of f i t t i n g melodic material to a particular harmonic background. this is accomplished by f i r s t performing a function analysis of the song. the term functional analysis refers to the process of identifying with each chord i t s function within the song  and grouping together measures that move the tune from one key center to another. to identify functional structure  we f i r s t ident i f y the key centers. within these key centers  chords can be named and assigned functional roles. having named chords and identified key centers we are able to compute scales which are compatible with the harmonic background. 
overview and definition of the problem 
　　as music is performed it passes through a number of temporary key centers. these temporary key centers are sometimes very d i f f i c u l t to establ i s h . jazz musicians learn to identify key centers by listening for harmonic qualities in musicthese harmonic qualities depend to a large degree on which notes are sounded together during the execution of a piece of music what the musician hears has to some extent been codified in terms of a harmonic theory. the program presented by this text depends primarily on a theory described in coker   1 . 
　　a quick but incomplete grasp of this process of identifying key centers can be made in terms of scales. roughly speaking  a scale is an ordered set of notes from which melodies can be b u i l t . each musical key is associated with the notes of a particular scale- suppose that the union of the notes of three consecutive chords is identical with the notes of a particular scale. then the chances are great that the key center is one associated with the identified scale. 
　　while giving a good intuitive feel for how chords may be used to determine keys  the above observations may not be applied directly. there are several reasons why this is so. f i r s t l y   in jazz  variety is achieved by substituting certain chords for others. these substitute chords are not identical with the original chords and in fact may contain notes not found in the scale associated with the key. they do  however  function harmonically as though they were the chords that they replace. secondly  some chords are played with notes omitted. in such cases the sense of harmonic history allows the listener or 
musician to f i l l in the chord with his ear. finally the chord may be functioning as a transition chord between two other chords and as such does not have to conform to the harmonic restrictions of the key. 
　　because of the above considerations  it is necessary to approach the problem of determining key centers in a rather indirect manner. the i n tuitive idea is t h i s . we try out different key centers u n t i l we find one in which the observed chords each have functional meaning. again this intuitive idea requires some refinement. the principle problem is that a set of notes determines a unique chord only if the key has already been specified. for example  the notes  d fa c  determine a d minor 1 chord in the key of c. the same set of notes determine an f major 1 chord in the key of f- we seem to be blocked because we cannot identify the key u n t i l we identify the chord  but we cannot identify the chord without knowing the key. 
　　the approach taken to circumvent this problem is to f i r s t attach to each set of notes a l l possible chords with which it may be identified. the results of this process are then passed on to a key analyzer. the analyzer associates with each set of notes a set of keys in which some identified chord can function. some key will occur in each set throughout a section of the music when this is observed  the repeating key is assigned to the corresponding section of the music it may turn out that some sections are very short and have many keys associated with them- this usually indicates a section of the music that is harmoni c a l l y ambiguous and functioning as a transition section between two key centers or between two functional chords of the same key center. finally the music and analyzed key centers are passed to a 

a d d i i e a t i o n s - l : u l r i c h 

functional analyzer. the functional analyzer identifies and outputs the function of each chord with respect to i t s key center. 
the representation of songs 
　　because of our interest in harmony we view a musical composition as a sequence of chords. each chord is identified by a set of musical notes as already pointed out the set may identi fy more than one chord.  each chord is preceded by a number which represents the number of beats the chord 
is held before the next chord is sounded. to simplify the problem somewhat we assume that chords change only on the beat. additionally we assume that the absolute pitch of the notes is not important and that the voicing of the chords is such that each note is less than an octave apart from the next highest note of the chord. we represent the note sets as l i s t s with the lowest note occuring f i r s t   next lowest second and so on. as an example consider the f i r s t chord of figure 1. the l i s t is  1 b+ d f . the convention specifies that the chord is held for two beats. we use + and - to represent the usual sharp and f l a t signs-

basic chord forms 
　　in jazz the harmonic quality is largely determined by chords. each chord is associated with a particular harmonic quality. most people are familiar with the major and minor qualities found in religious music in jazz there are many other qualities. two distinct chords may have the same quality even though they contain none of the same notes. this is because quality is determined by the relative distances between notes rather than absolute pitch. additionally chords with identical notes may have a different quality depending on the harmonic context in which they are sounded-
　associated with each quality is a chord type. a chord type is just a l i s t of numbers which give the distance from the lowest note or root to each 
of the other notes of the chord. this distance is measured in half steps. in western music a half step is the smallest distance that separates two notes. in table 1  the reader is given several octaves of musical notes. the numbers give the distances from each note to the lowest note of the table . the letters are the standard names for the notes. the symbol  *  refers to sharps and f l a t s . table 1: half step table 

　　to compute the distance between a pair of notes we take the absolute value of the difference between the associated numbers. if x is a note and n a number then the expression x + n w i l l refer to the note n half steps above x. for instance d + 1 refers to the note a in the table- we can deter-
mine the notes of a chord when we know the lowest or root note of the chord plus its type. if x is the root and  n  .....nk   is a chord type then the notes of the chord are  x x+rl.   - . .  x+nk  . for example if the root is i  and the type is  1 1  then the notes that are determined are  d fa c  commonly known as d mi nor y we shall usually prefer the notation d 1 1  to  d f a c . when such notation is used the l e t t e r in front w i l l be called the root and the l i s t w i l l be the chord type. 
   there are two types of transformations which can be performed on chords which preserve to some extent their quality. we call these transformations inversions and omissions- inversion changes the order of the notes while omission removes one or more notes of the chord. inversions in practice usually leave the lowest note unchangedsuch inversions we call root 1 inversions. less frequently the inversion changes the lowest note. this is done most often to accommodate the base l i n e . inversions whose lowest note is the second note of the original chord we call root 1 inversion. inversions whose lowest note was the third note of the original chord we call root 1 inversions and so f o r t h . omissions provide additional problems because to determine the chord from a set of notes we must find out which notes were l e f t out. in practice these missing notes are determined by the harmonic context of the chord . this can be accomplished only if the basic functioning parts of the chord are l e f t in tact.

consider the notes  fa c d  which identify f major 1 chord and a root 1 inversion of d minor 1. if we omit the a we get  f c d . this group of notes sounds much more d minor 1 than f major 1 even though f is the lowest note of the group. the 
problem is that we removed the second note of the chord- for similar reasons removing the f or the d would render the chord unsuitable for f major 1. the general principle that we adopt is to disallow the omission of the lower two notes and the highest note in the chord.  this is in accordance with with standard musical practice . omission of any or a l l of the other notes w i l l be allowed and we shall need to find ways to determine the omitted notes. 
   we are now ready to define the entire set of basic chords. this is accomplished with the chord grammar given in table  . in addition to the complete forms of the chords the grammar generates a l l possible forms with omitted notes. the names of the nonterminals may be suggestive of the usual names of the chords for those familiar with standard chord nomenclature. the chords generated are most of the chords in common use . table 1 is provided for the reader who wishes to make a quick association between some chord names used by the program and those names in common musical usage. the variable x of the table can be replaced with any musical note. for instance if g is substituted for x the table t e l l s us that g major 1 is named g 1 1  by the program g minor 1 is named g 1 1  and so on.

the note is selected as the root. then the rest of the notes are seen to be explainable in terms of a permutation or a basic chord type this is done for a l l possible choices of root. the algorithm given inputs a l i s t of notes and outputs a l i s t of chords which may be identified with the input. for instance if the input is   d f a c   then the output w i l l be  d 1 1   f   1 1   since 
  d fa c  represents d minor 1 root 1 or f major 1 root 1. if the input is  f a c d  the output w i l l be identical to the f i r s t case since  fa c d  represents d minor 1 root   or f major 1 root 1. finally if the input is  c e b  we have a situation where a note was omitted. the original chord should be  c e g b  or  c e g- b . in this case the algorithm returns c{1 1  corresponds to  c e g b . it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the concept of a nondeterministic algorithm. the choose...thendo..-else construction used in the chord recognition algorithm is to be interpreted as follows: if some choice can be made which satisfies the conditions between the 

choose and the thendo then the code following the thendo is executed. 	otherwise control passes to the code following the else- 	the execution of 
back track x1 ....xn   has i t s usual meaning with con-
t r o l passing to the point of the last successful choice and the variables x1 . . x bei ng reset to 
their value at the time just prior to the last 
successful choice. 
recognition algorithm 
the recognition of chords 
   the grammar of table 1 may not be used directly to recognize chords because not a l l inversions of chords are generated. instead a somewhat more complicated approach must be taken. first one of 
	a p p l i c a t i o n s - l : 	u l r i c h 

unmark a l l rules that begin y - ; 
  b  backtrack  z  y  x  od 
else outputl; 
　　there are two backtracking operations marked a and b. at a either x is empty or y= stop . if x is empty then we have exhausted the set of notes. if y= stop  then there are no more nonterminals to process. if both of these conditions are true we have succeeded in identifying each note with a chord element. the backtrack at b means that we 
have exhausted a l l rules beginning with y. 
　　the chord namer applies the recognition algorithm to each group of notes in the song. 	tt produces an output identical to the input except that the groups of notes are replaced by a set of possi-
ble chords. figure 1 illustrates this process. figure 1 gives a transcription of the bridge section of blue moon as it would be presented to the chord namer. figure 1 represents the output from the chord namer. 
analysis of keys 
　　the next step in determining the functional structure takes place in the key analyzer. this 
program partitions the music into harmonically uniform segments and assigns to each segment a key center. this process is accomplished in several steps. each step may be thought of as a refine-
ment of the previous steps. the process is roughly as follows. we begin be segmenting the song into as many segments as there are chords. our aim is to reduce the number of segments to as few as 
possible. we reduce the number of segments by combining adjacent segments. segments may be combined in just the case that our musical theory can analyze a l l the chords of both segments in a single key. thus each segment must be harmonically consistent. this condition is t r i v i a l l y satisfied when each segment contains a single chord. 
　　the combining of adjacent segments takes place in a single program called  combine . since it is used at each stage of the key analyzer  we begin by describing combine. the input to combine is a l i s t of segments  s1 s1 ... sn  . each segment is a l i s t of three elements  1 k c  where 1 is a number representing the length of the segment  k is a set of possible keys for the segment and c represents the sequence of chords making up the segment. each element of c is a l i s t of two elements  n cset  where n is the number of beats the chord is held and cset is a set of possible names for the chord as determined by the chord namer. see for example figure 1. let  l1 k1 c1  and  l1 k1 c1  be two adjacent segments. we can combine them if the common part of k1 and k1 is not empty. in this case the combination is just l i s t  l1 + l1  intersection -  k1    append c1  c1  . the combining algorithm performs the combining step u n t i l it no longer applies to any pair of segments. the outcome certainly might depend on the order in which the pairs were processed and one can construct 
a r t i f i c i a l examples to prove this point. 	with actual music it seems sufficient to process from l e f t to right and ignore other p o s s i b i l i t i e s . 
combine s ;input s; output t; t : = n i l ; 
while s is not empty do  n k c := f i r s t   s   ; s:= t a i l   s   ; loop: if s not empty then do  n' k' c' := f i r s t   s   ; if k' and k have an element in common thendo 
n: = n + n' ; k:= intersection k k' ; c:= append c c' ; s:= t a i l   s   ; 
go to loop; 
	od 	  
od 
	t::= 	append t list list n k c   ; 
od 
end of combine; 
   the theory we use for determining possible function is discussed in   1  . it is based on what are commonly called seventh chords. for the purpose of applying this theory we trunce.te our chords by removing a l l numbers greater than 1 from the type. this effectively discards a l l superpositions of the basic seventh chords. in jazz harmony there arc three important functional roles called the tonic  dominant and subdominant. if x is the key then the chords x 1 1   x+1 1  and x+  1 1  respectively play these roles. the rough harmonic analysis performed at the f i r s t stage of key analysis part i t i o n s the music based on this fact. in doing this some mistakes w i l l be made and must be corrected later by using a more refined harmonic theory. the above observations yield the following: 
1. x{1 1  and x 1 1  and x{1  function as tonic in x 
1. x{1 1  functions as dominant in x-1 
1. x 1 1  functions as subdominant in the key of x-1. 
　　the f i r s t step of key identification processes each set of possible chords as they arc determined by the chord namer. if any of the chords are of the above type it is assumed to be functioning in one of the above roles. the key center is determined on the basis of this assumption. for an example of the execution of this step refer to figure 1.

l e t rt = root of x and t = type of x; i f t =  1 1  or t =  1 1  or t =  1  then add rt to y else 
if t =  1 1  then add r t - 1 to y else 
if t =  1 1  then add rt-1 to y

　　the song how high the moon is illustrated in figure 1. notice that the output from stepl contains some very small segments of questionable harmonic meaning. this w i l l be true in general because of the simple harmonic theory used in stepl. there are three possible reasons why these small .segments may belong to an adjacent segment. first of a l l the segment may contain chords that are functioning in the place of other chords. this is a common practice in jazz music since it provides harmonic variety to the music. for example in the key of c  e 1 1  may function as c 1 1 . the original analysis  by not taking this into account would have concluded that e 1 1  was in the key of d instead of c  see 1 . the second reason why a small segment may be assigned the wrong key is that it is functioning as tonic r e l i e f . tonic r e l i e f is a harmonic  device which is used to strengthen chord progressions by moving the key center up five half steps. the center usually returns to the original key within a few measures. for this reason most musicians do not regard tonic r e l i e f as a proper key change and prefer to retain the original key throughout the segment. finally the small segments may be sequences of transition chords which arc used in music to provide a smooth change from one chord to another. the use of transition chords is an area least well covered by functional theory. this is because transition chords actually function outside the usual harmony of the music. invariably they resolve into something functional or into another transition. the reader w i l l find it helpful to follow the example of figure 1. to make reading easier to follow  mult i p l e names of chords have been omitted from the example input. 


　　step1 refines the i n i t i a l segmentation by applying possible chord substitutions. the substitutions used are listed in table 1. the second column of table 1 specifies the function of the chord that it is substituting for. it is to be understood that x varies over the set of musical notes/keys. for instance if x is f then the tablc t e l l s us that f 1 1  can function as the dominant of the key of f-1 or e. step1 begins by augmenting the key sets of small segments by allowing substitute chords to function as the tonic  dominant  or subdominant of the segment's key. a small segment is defined to be shorter than p1 where p1 is a system parameter. when this is completed combine is used to merge adjacent segments that may now be combined.

functional analysis of chords 
   having completed the identification of key centers we are ready to associate with each chord its functional meaning. this is accomplished by applying a harmonic theory to each of the chords of the song. if the chord belongs to a segment with two or more possible keys then it will be analyzed in more than one way. the theory that we shall use is embodied in table 1. the x stands for the key in which the chords are being analyzed. the analysis program instantiates the table by substituting for x the key of the current segment. it then looks up each chord of the segment in the instantiated table. if a chord cannot we now indicate how the analysis can be used to f i t melodic material to a given harmonic background. we use motifs to represent melodic material. in music a motif refers to a small 
snatch of melody. sequences of motifs are woven together to form a melody. rather than constantly inventing new motifs  the musician modifies old ones to f i t new harmonic situations. this is accomplished by imposing on the motif a scale based on the key of the current section of music. examples and discussions of motifs may be found in coker  chapter 1. 
   we use the notion of an abstract motif. an abstract motif is like a motif except that is is void of rhythmic and harmonic structure. when these motifs are f i t into a specified rhythmic 

applicattons-1: ulrich 1 

and harmonic context they become m o t i f s in the usual sense. the harmonic context is determined by the key centers and the chord names produced by the key a n a l y s i s program. we w i l l show how a b s t r a c t m o t i f s may be i n s t a n t i a t e d w i t h respect to harmony. to i l l u s t r a t e the process we w i l l f i t i n s t a n t i a t i o n s o f a m o t i f t o the f i r s t e i g h t 
measures of how high the moon. 
　　before we can understand how i n s t a n t i a t i o n s are computed  we must understand the use of s c a l e s . it was mentioned above t h a t a scale was a sequence of notes from which melodies are c o n s t r u c t e d . most are f a m i l i a r w i t h the sound of c major s c a l e . this scale corresponds e x a c t l y to the white keys o n the piano. i f the reader r e f e r s t o table 1   s t a r t s at the f i r s t c in the t a b l e   and proceeds up through the l e t t e r e d notes to the next c in the t a b l e   then he w i l l have i d e n t i f i e d c major s c a l e . if we compute the h a l f steps associated w i t h each of the notes we get the l i s t  1 1 t 1 1   . this suggests t h a t we represent c major scale s i m i l a r t o the n o t a t i o n w i t h which represent chords  i . e .   c 1 1 1 1   . we c a l l c the r o o t of the scale and  1 1 1 1  the t y p e . d 1 1 '  1 1   w i l l be d major scale and so on. besides the major types of scales t h e r e are many others in general use. gome common ones are d o r i a n   m i x o l y d i a n and whole t o n e . they are defined by the scale types  1 1 1 1 1      1 1 1 1  and  1 1 1 1  respect i v e l y . each type of chord is associated w i t h a set of scale types t h a t are harmonically c o n s i s tent w i t h the chord. coker l i s t s these a s s o c i a t i o n s . we give in table 1 a l i s t of the scales commonly r e f e r r e d to and t h e i r set of compatible chords. 
	table 1: 	scales 

   we specify a motif as a sequence of displacements measured in scale steps. for instance 
 1 1 1 1 1 1  represents a motif of 1 notes. if we specify a scale say c major then we can identify each number in the abstract motif with a particular note. this is accomplished by associating each number of the motif with a location in the scale type. to compute a note associated with a number in the abstract motif we use the number as an index into the scale. this obtains for us the number of half steps the desired note is above the f i r s t note of the scale. using c major scale with the above example we obtain  d g b c b g db c b c d   if on the other hand we specify g mixolydian we get  a d f g f d a f g f g a  which is harmonically very different from the f i r s t case. 
　　the instantiation of a motif should retain i t s pitch throughout a segment. when a new segment is encountered however the motif is shifted in pitch so that it is now expressed relative to the new key center. there is a problem however in following this strategy. when a new chord is encountered the harmonic quality of the music changes. this usually requires that other notes of the original scale be altered. additionally notes of the motif that belong to the chord should be emphasized. this is accomplished by accent  rhythm and phrasing. 
　　to accommodate the changing harmonic quality of the music  musicians are taught to  think chords''. each chord that is sounded is associated with a set of compatible scales that are b u i l t on the root of the chord. the musician selects one of these scales. by restricting the notes he plays to those of the scale selected he avoids creating harmonic conflict. for instance the g l 1 1 1 1  scale is used with the g 1 1  chord. this is not entirely satisfactory for our purpose since the motif is expressed relative to the key of the entire segment which is likely to be different than g. in order to maintain the pitch of the motif and at the same time follow the usual musical practice  we modify the scale that the musician would use as follows: suppose that x is the key and y is the scale that is suitable. we create a new scale which is a permutation of y and has x as the root note. this new scale then becomes the basis for instantiating the motif. for example if the key is c then the scale g 1 1 1 1  would be modified to c 1 1 1 1 1 . these two scales contain exactly the same notes  just the root is different. under some conditions x w i l l not belong to the desired scale. in such cases we require the lowest note of the permuted scale to be above x but as close to x as possible. for computational reasons we keep x as the root of the scale even though in this case the scale does not contain x. 
   we have applied these concepts to generate an improvisation for the f i r s t eight bars of how high the moon. the rhythm was specified before hand in an ad hoc manner. the result is i l l u s trated in figure 1. the scales were computed on the basis of table 1. the motif was repeated when necessary. from such a simple technique the result 
is bound to be less than interesting music. 	the 
music is however consistent with the harmonic 
structure of the song. 
discussion 
   a feature of this work is that it takes a nongrammatical approach to harmonic analysis. some confusion may arise at this point because of the use of a grammar for the recognition of chord types. however the chord grammar is only used for the i n i t i a l naming of chords. the recognition of key centers and functional analysis of chords are noticeably non-grammatical.

　　in the long run the question of whether grammatical approaches are superior to nongrammatical ones may depend on how much harmonic s t r u c t u r e can be derived from l o c a l p r o p e r t i e s o f the music. i f g l o b a l p r o p e r t i e s are e s s e n t i a l to harmonic a n a l y s i s   then a grammar may provide a u s e f u l means of r e p r e s e n t i n g the g l o b a l o r g a n i z a t i o n . however in the case of jazz music  a 
musician can u s u a l l y i d e n t i f y the key on the basis of two or t h r e e consecutive chords. if t h i s statement can be v e r i f i e d experimentally then t h e r e is strong reason to believe t h a t jazz encodes so much harmony in the l o c a l s t r u c t u r e of the music t h a t ' g l o b a l considerations can be 
ignored. 
　　the assumption is made in t h i s study t h a t it is meaningful to represent melodic m a t e r i a l as abstract m o t i f s devoid of rhythmic and harmonic content. this assumption can be regarded as an approximation at best and must stand the t r i a l of f u t u r e i n v e s t i g a t i o n . moorer  k  reports a study  probably o r i g i n a l l y from lundin   1     w h i c h demonstrates t h a t subjects can determine on the basis of r e l a t i v e p i t c h when two consecutive notes w i l l achieve melodic r e s o l u t i o n . this suggests t h a t harmonic p r i n c i p l e s   i . e .   r e l a -

　　the jazz musician has two problems. the f i r s t is the c r e a t i o n of melodic m a t e r i a l . the second i s the problem o f f i t t i n g the melodic m a t e r i a l i n t o a p a r t i c u l a r harmonic s t r u c t u r e . the work described in t h i s paper concentrates on t h i s second problem. to solve the problem we u t i l i z e d a harmonic theory which allowed the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of key centers and the assignment of f u n c t i o n a l 
meaning to chards. from t h i s we constructed scales t h a t were compatible w i t h the analyzed harmonic s t r u c t u r e . these scales were then used t o t r a n s l a t e a b s t r a c t melodic m a t e r i a l i n t o sequences of notes t h a t sound compatible w i t h the background chords. 
　　the work described here is j u s t a beginning. for instance the theory used does not apply to songs w i t h minor t o n a l i t y and needs to be enlarged. the method f o r f i t t i n g m o t i f s to harmonic s t r u c t u r e is more an i l l u s t r a t i o n than a r e l i a b l e technique. the use of rhythm was not t r e a t e d at a l l nor was the problem of developing a l i b r a r y of useful m o t i f s . in s p i t e of these shortcomings the methods described do deal q u a n t i t a t i v e l y w i t h a number of p r a c t i c a l problems f a c i n g jazz musicians such as the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of keycenter  the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of chords and the c o n s t r u c t i o n of scales t h a t are harmonically compatible w i t h the i d e n t i f i e d keys.
