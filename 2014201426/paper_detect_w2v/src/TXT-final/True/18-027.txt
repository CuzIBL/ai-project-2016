 
　　　in t h i s paper  we describe a method using semantic constraints to reduce the ambiguities and generate case structure from phrase structure in chinese sentence analysis. 
　　　semantic constraints written on semantic markers indicate the plausible 
case structure. different sets of semantic markers 	are 	chosen 	according 	to 	the purpose. 	a 	p r i o r i t y evaluation 	scheme steers 	the 	analysis 	towards 	the 	most plausible structure f i r s t   	without trying a l l 	p o s s i b i l i t i e s . 
1. introduction 
　　　chinese 	is 	written with 	characters that 	don't 	admit 	formal 	i n f l e c t i o n s to indicate 	the 	grammatical 	categories 	of 
words. also  there are few functional words  so few cues are available to indicate the grammatical structure. 
　　　automatic parsing of chinese runs immediately into an explosive growth of 
possible structures 	due to ambiguity  	so syntactic and semantic constraints must be introduced 	as 	soon 	as 	possible in 	the analysis to r e s t r i c t the search. 
　　　knowledge that can be used for t h i s purpose is mostly of a p a r t i a l nature that leads to  plausible  interpretations. as such  it is d i f f i c u l t to manage  because 
　　　
several 	p o s s i b i l i t i e s occur at each step. 
　　　in a previous paper  yang et a l . 1   we show how to use the knowledge associated with  characteristic words  in a preprocessor designed to precede syntactical analysis. 
　　　here we describe a system that uses the semantic categories of words to obtain case structure. 
	1. case 	structure analysis 
　　　in chinese  we cannot derive the phrase structure from the syntactic categories of the words and phrases  because cues such as conjunctions and inflexions are for most part lacking. 
　　　a l l three examples show the same sequence np-vt-np-vp. the np  vp  e t c .   are the p a r t i a l results of a phrase structure analysis stage  but the analysis cannot proceed from here on. a l l the examples consist of two clauses  but the relationship between them is different in each case. in example 1  the clause is embedded  whereas examples 1 and 1 have both a  pivotal structure   li and thompson 1   that i s   the second np is both the object of the preceding clause and the subject of the following clause. these differences only emerge if oneconsiders the meaning of the words. 
　　　in our system we t r y to apply semantic knowledge to l i f t this kind of 
　　　

1. semantic constraints for case structure 
　　　we determine the case structure from the p a r t i a l syntactic structure using semantic markers. the semantic markers  for nouns  verbs  etc.  used for writing the constraints are organized in hierarchies of semantic categories. multiple hierarchies are used  according to the purpose  the particular ambiguity to be l i f t e d   and the subject domain of the text. 
　　　consider the examples above. we choose the case structure according to the semantic category of the verbs. seven types of case structure are defined for the np-vt-np-vp sequence  including the two types shown in figure1 . likewise  verbs are classified into seven groups named let  emotion  have  know  need  teach and other  each of which corresponds to one type of structure. note however that one verb can belong to several groups. 
y. yangetal. 1 
the rules are like the following: 
  i f the preceding verb belongs to the emotion group  then use the  pivot construction   as in example 1   with a 
　cause r e l a t i o n ; if the posterior verb  in vp  belongs to 
the need group  then the preceding part  np-vt-np is a clause which is the subject of vp  as in example 1 ; . . .   
     in some cases  the rules give contradictory conclusions. in example 1  the verb belongs to the emotion group  but belongs to the  need  group. we must find a way of managing such multiple p o s s i b i l i t i e s and choosing among them. this is done by means of the p r i o r i t y calculus scheme that we describe further on. 
     consider  as another example  the sentence '. like the sentence  a is b  in english  is a very common sentence in chinese  but it is d i f f i c u l t to decide i t s scope  that i s   where a begins and where b finishes. as above  we l i f t the ambiguity by using the semantical properties of a and b  to choose from several possible phrase structures. 
　　　for this particular problem we use a semantic hierarchy containing about 1 semantic markers for nouns  borrowed from the mu-project. however  we add cross relationships that link some categories that are not sub-categories one of the other. for example  in the physics textbooks that we tested our system w i t h   the need appeared for relationships linking 
 physical phenomenon  with   r e l a t i o n      standard  with  unit  etc.. this kind of add-on relationship is domain-dependant. 
　　　in the case where either a or b is an embedded clause  a quite different c l a s s i f i c a t i o n is appropriate  grouping for example the words that would most frequently stand opposite an event like 
        reason   	 problem    state   	   function   etc.. 
　　　thus the semantical hierarchies are both domain and problem  ambiguity  dependant. 
1. priority 
　　　as we mentioned above  our semantic constraints use knowledge which is 
- not 1% correct  only s t a t i s t i c a l l y probable   
- not complete  described for parts of structure  or only written for typical situations . 
this often results in some wrong decisions when a local analysis is done  so at some stages several p o s s i b i l i t i e s must be retained. we use a p r i o r i t y scheme to 
　　　
1 y yang et al 
evaluate the p l a u s i b i l i t y of each case structure and find the best choice. 
in calculation: 
　a  partial p r i o r i t y is calculated by constraint rules. it is determined experimentally. 
　b  positive p r i o r i t y indicates a l i k e l y structure  negative p r i o r i t y an unlikely structure  1 is i n d i f f e r e n t . 
　c  p r i o r i t y 	of the 	whole structure 	is 
the sum of p a r t i a l p r i o r i t i e s . 
　　　consider the two plausible structures in example 1  for example. their scores are both given as + 1 when the semantic constraints are checked with np-vt-np-vp. however  the score for  a is b  in the structure of figure 1 is +1 because both a   he   and b   fatso   belong to the same group human. the score for the other interpetation    i t is a big fatso that the childrens laugh at him.   is -1 because a  an embeded clause  and human b   fatso    form an unlikely pair. the two p a r t i a l scores above are added together  and the correct structure in figure 1  has the higher score. 
1. other features 
　　　　　for describing the knowledge used in semantic analysis  a complete set of rules comprising both general and word specific rules would be clumsy to w r i t e   use and modify. instead  we use an objectoriented scheme to separate the rules into independent modules  objects  according to their operational properties  and organize them into layers of classes. more then one parent  or a set of parents are allowed. the object-oriented interpreter supports a nondeterministic search mechanism for the multiple heritage. 
　　　a p r i o r i t y - d r i v e n parser is designed to make the searching e f f i c i e n t . the parser does a phrase structure analysis following context-free grammar rules  in a bottom-up way. it evokes an objectoriented interpreter  like calling a procedure  to generate case structure and calculate p r i o r i t y for each hypothesis it makes. only the p a r t i a l result with the highest p r i o r i t y is expanded. the others are saved  so the searching direction can be adjusted each time the p r i o r i t y is changed. 
　　　this system is in the course of being developed and is only p a r t i a l l y completed. as a preliminary evaluation  we tested the system against 1 typical sentences selected from grammar books and science and technology books in chinese  li and thompson 1  lu 1  zhu 1 . the correct case structures are obtained as f i r s t choice 1% of the time  and as f i r s t or second 1% of time. we also did a hand simulation with 1 sentences from a physics book in chinese  resulting in 1% success rate in the f i r s t choice. 
1. summary 
　　　in this paper  we described a technique for semantical analysis in our chinese analysis system. 
　　　rules of p a r t i a l semantic constraints b u i l t on a limited set of concepts are used to reduce the ambiguities in case structure generation. 
     the p r i o r i t y scheme gives us a way to write incomplete knowledge into our rules. the p r i o r i t y - d r i v e n parser guides the global analysis through the search space h e u r i s t i c a l l y   so a combinatorial explosion of computation can be avoided. 
　　　the object-oriented scheme makes it easy to modularize  access and modify d i f f e r e n t kinds of knowledge. 
　　　in conclusion  we hope this method to be useful for natural language processing  where very complex semantical information must be managed in an e f f i c i e n t way.
