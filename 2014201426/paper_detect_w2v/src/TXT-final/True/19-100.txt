1 	knowledge representation lytic. it provides with a certain set of propositions pertaining to a  possible  instance of the concept in question. 
　　we have to make the necessary distinction of analytic and synthetic knowledge. clearly  that the lack of a certain part or role results in the malfunction of the system as a whole. is synthetic knowledge. the concept of  a chair with two legs  could be derived from the concept of a chair by role restriction. however  whether this makes sense can be doubted. hence  a definitional component could be restricted by an assertinal one comprising the constraint  say: 
 a chair must have at least three legs  
thus preventing a knowledge engineer to conceive of  impossible concepts . an  elephant with three legs  or a  truck with two wheels  is not a concept derived by simple number restriction  but  based on a description of a possible contingent state of a system  a new concept dealing with a 
possible malfunction of a system. 
　　analytic and synthetic knowledge  though tightly intertwined  should be kept separatly requiring different modes of reasoning  deduction and  probabilistic  abduction  respectively. to model the correct deductions  i.e. to provide with epistemologlcahy adequate representations of knowledge  a semantics is required richer than the slot-and -filler -restriction scheme can account for.
