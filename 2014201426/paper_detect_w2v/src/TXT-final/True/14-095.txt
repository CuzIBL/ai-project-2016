   ipp  the integrated partial parser  is a complete understanding system that reads news stories and records them in a long-term episodic memory. ipp learns about the world by reading stories taken from newspapers and the upi news wire  adding information from these stories to memory  and making generalizations that describe specific s i t u a t i o n s . i t s primary domain is international terrorism. ipp uses the generalizations that it has made to help in understanding future s t o r i e s . 
a complete description of ipp can be found in   1     
¡¡as ipp adds stories to memory  it looks for similar events and attempts to make generalizations that describe the world. such generalizations form the basis for organizing events in memory and understanding later s t o r i e s . 
   as a story understander  ipp makes extensive use of top-down  predictive processing. as it processes a story  ipp accesses memory in an attempt to i d e n t i f y generalizations describing stereotypical situations that can provide predictions to be used in understanding  yielding a a robust and e f f i c i e n t understanding system that has been used to understand over 1 news s t o r i e s . 
¡¡the overall design of ipp  involving the integration of parsing  memory update/generalization  and generalization-based 
memory is shown in figure 1.
