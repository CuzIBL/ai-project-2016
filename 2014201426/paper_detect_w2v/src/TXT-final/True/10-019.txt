       in what follows  we want to describe a system for the automatic abstracting of textual mat e r i a l . in designing the system  major t h e o r e t i cal questions have arisen not unlike those that arise in dealing with any natural language system. in addition  we want to describe some proposed revisions which have important theoretical implications and which should lead to significant improvements in the capabilities of the present system. 
       our i n i t i a l e f f o r t s at automatic abstracting began in 1 as part of a more general questionanswering system  tharp  1; tharp and krulee  1  which made use of short stories about f a mous discoveries taken from a children's encyclopedia. the original text was mapped into a set of predicates representing the logical content of the story. although the main emphasis in this system was on question-answering  there were two questions that could be asked that made use of a summarizing and abstracting c a p a b i l i t y . these 
were: 	 who is the central character in the story   and  what is the main theme of the story   
       in our current efforts  taylor  1   we have extended tharp's methods in order to deal more e x p l i c i t l y with the problem of automatic abs t r a c t i n g . the system represents the meaning of a 
       text in terms of the semantic networks of simmons  1  which are based on the case grammar r e l a tionships of fillmore  1 . in this form of representation  the nodes are words or concepts while the arcs represent a case grammar r e l a t i o n ship that exists between a pair of nodes. using the graphical techniques of ramamoorthy  1   the system i d e n t i f i e s a portion of the original network  namely  the maximally connected subgraph  or graphs . then using the techniques of signal flow graph analysis  the system i d e n t i f i e s nodes that are most i n f l u e n t i a l within the maximally connected subgraph. by proceeding i t e r a t i v e l y   using this pair of techniques  a subgraph is obtained which serves as an abstract of the o r i g i nal t e x t . as a f i n a l step  again using a technique due to simmons and slocum  1   the subgraph is converted back into a set of natural language sentences as the f i n a l output. 
       the results of these i n i t i a l attempts are reasonably encouraging although certain practical d i f f i c u l t i e s have been encountered. for example  even a short sample of text  one or two pages  leads to the formation of a complex network that is d i f f i c u l t to store. however  computer time for the processing of these networks is not excessive  less than ten seconds on a cdc 1  and l i m i t a tions of space are more serious than of computer time. 
       during the past year  we have introduced a series of modifications into the original system  lindner  1 . one of these has to do with texts that have multiple themes  such as a main theme and some subsidiary themes. in our original system  the f i r s t part of the process leads to the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of several maximally connected subgraphs  msc's . however  only one of these-the l a r g e s t - - i s chosen as the basis for developing an abstract. this subgraph usually does contain the main theme plus some related d e t a i l s . a secondary theme may well be contained in a second mcs. thus  by choosing only a single mcs  one biases the system towards the development of an abstract that overemphasizes details r e l a t i n g to the main theme while ignoring secondary themes. 
       accordingly  we experimented with longer multiple-theme texts and with a procedure that would select the largest mcs plus one or more a d d i t i tional mcs's. the resulting abstract appears to be much improved. for example  using as a text a book review  three important mcs's were i d e n t i f i e d   the f i r s t concerned primarily with a d i s cussion of the author and the second and third 
with the main character of the book and the theme of the novel  respectively. thus  an abstract 
making use of a l l three leads clearly to a much more balanced presentation than does an abstract of equal length that refers only to the author. 
       our original program was unable to handle networks of more than 1 nodes. basically  the revised technique deals with the t e x t   paragraph by paragraph. as a f i r s t step  the network associated with each paragraph is reduced  one at a time  thus obtaining a sequence of reduced networks  one from each paragraph. these networks are recombined into a single network and converted back into an abstract. these abstracts obtained are not unlike those obtained through the use of the original method. most importantly  with this modification  it is the length of each paragraph that is c r i t i c a l rather than the length of the text as a whole  although  as the number of paragraphs increases  one again runs into d i f f i c u l t i e s in storing the reduced networks for each of a series of paragraphs. 
¡¡¡¡¡¡we now find ourselves faced with the problem of introducing modifications that would lead to a significant improvement in the capabilities of this abstracting system. we propose to introduce some radical changes of which the following are perhaps the most s i g n i f i c a n t . 
1. in many respects  networks representative of the meaning of a text make use of logical predicates as the basic semantic units and the higherlevel semantic unit that is computed is the prod-
uct of a  bottom-up  form of analysis with the propositions being related in pairs u n t i l the 

n a t u r a l 	l a n * u a s e - 1 : 	t a y l o r 
1 

overall network emerges as a f i n a l product. as an a l t e r n a t i v e   we propose that the higher-level se-
mantic analysis should be  top-down  in the sense of making predictions about the overall thematic structure of the material being processed. moreover  this analysis should make use of a higher l e v e l or semantic grammar much l i k e the thematic grammar that rumelhart  1  has proposed for the thematic analysis of children's stories. 
1. secondly  we are assuming that abstracting is normally a dynamic process that should be primari l y l o g i c a l or q u a l i t a t i v e in form and making use of what we might refer to as substitution or condensing operators. formally  these operators might resemble an axiom or theorem in mathematics  stating that certain content can be substituted for certain other content. these operators w i l l  condense  in the sense of taking a network representing a portion of text and replacing it with a simplified network or perhaps a single node. sometimes  the basis for condensing the text is made e x p l i c i t in the t e x t   in which case the operator is not unlike a procedure for identifying c e r t a i n types of phrases in context. for example  one often encounters sentences in the form:  there are two main methods for the production 
of .  or  when constructing a   one immediately faces three types of problems.  thus  in the abstract  one wants to i d e n t i f y in one case the two main methods and in the other case the three types of problems. moreover  one probably wants to name the methods or problems while ignoring a l l of the amplifying d e t a i l s . unfortunately  
under many circumstances  such strong clues may not be given e x p l i c i t l y and must be inferred in much the same way that answers not e x p l i c i t l y contained in a data base can be inferred by problem solving or theorem proving methods. thus  in our revised system we want to include a capability for  proving  that a set of summarizing statements can be inferred from the original data base. 
       in short  we are proposing two major modifications to our present abstracting program in order to make the system perform in a moce  humanl i k e   fashion and in order to develop a system 
with a s i g n i f i c a n t l y improved level of competence.
