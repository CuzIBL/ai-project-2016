     w-js is a first-order predicate calculus on the modal theory of knowledge. it is based on natural deduction rules and accompanied by possible-worldaccessibility semantics. as an example  the famous  mr. s and mr. p  puzzle is solved in w-js.

     reasoning about knowledge is one of the areas which has received the most attention from researchers in ai. j. mccarthy and others  mccarthy  et al.  1  have given a propositional modal logic of knowledge and some examples solved in it. but it is obvious that the famous mr. s and mr. p puzzle  see appendix  cannot be effectively formulated in a propositional modal logic. and  in a personal communication  j. mccarthy let us know that he had challenged the modal logicians to solve this puzzle. what we present here is a solution  we believe. this is a brief version of our paper  ma and guo  1 .

     w-languages are extensions of the usual first-order languages. 
     to express the statements about knowledge  we distinguish three cases: 

where p is a wff  c is a term  and 1 is a subject symbol. in addition  we use 

to denote ''s accepts p  or  s doesn't know that - p . 
     here is a short description of the syntax of wlanguages. 
symbols: a symbol is one of the following: 
subject symbols; 
constant symbols; 
concept symbols; 
variable symbols; 
function symbols; 
predicate symbols; 

terms: a term is one of the following: 
a constant symbol; 
a concept symbol; 
a variable symbol; 

subject-terms: a subject-term is a finite string of subject symbols. 
formulas: a formula is one of the following: 

p t1 ....  tn  where p is an n-ary predicate symbol  and t1  . . .   tn are n terms; where p is a formula; where p and q are formulas; 
vx p where p is a formula and x is a variable symbol; 
s:p where p is a formula and 1 is a subject-term. 
we will use the conventional abbreviations   
	in addition  the following 
abbreviations are new: 


m. xiwen and g. weide 1 

1 m. xiwen and g. weide

mr. s and mr. p puzzle: 
two numbers m and n are chosen such that 
1   m   n   1. 
mr. s is told their sum and mr. p is told their product. the following dialogue ensues: 
mr. s: i know you don't know the numbers. i don't know them either. 
mr. p: now i know the numbers. 
mr. s: now i know them too. 
¡¡¡¡in view of the above dialogue  what are the numbers
