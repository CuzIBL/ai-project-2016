. it ignores  
	j. fox 	1 
quite deliberately  the meaning of the events it deals with and concentrates on the formal structure of problems. it ignores the idiosyncrasies of the situation and i t s participants  and it ignores details of organisational or social contexts which can exert powerful influences on the very interpretation of a problem  as well as on the form of an acceptable solution. the r i s k of a nuclear disaster may be calculably remote  but that is irrelevant if my concern is with the competence of engineering contractors  the standard of routine maintenance  or the p o s s i b i l i t y that plutonium may f a l l into the wrong hands. 
　　second  mathematics is u n i n t e l l i g i b l e to most of us. this is not just because we lack some education  but more 
important it is a consequence of i t s abstractness. the s t a t i s t i c s on smoking are conclusive  but the effect on smokers has been l i m i t e d . the treasury's model of the economy might be as good a predictive device as humanity can develop but citizens can't see how  or i f   the model r e f l e c t s the rise or decline of economic a c t i v i t i e s that affect them. we just don't understand models that depend upon the interaction of f i f t y parameters. in effect we have no basis for assessing the personal implications of such calculations  and they are inevitably disregarded in individuals' personal  p o l i t i c a l and economic behaviour. 
　　thirdly  and consequent upon t h i s lack of i n t e l l i g i b i l i t y   many of us cannot t r u s t those who define ' r a t i o n a l social p o l i c i e s ' even if we should. if we accept the mathematics  without understanding  we accept the power of technical e l i t e s to decide matters that affect us without being accountable to us. disastrous medical advice can easily be dismissed as  the luck of the draw . the effects of a bad regulation or economic policy  could not have been foreseen . who can check  claims that professional ethics or public accountability provide proper controls are j u s t seen as special pleading and status quoism. human judgement may be rough and ready but it has the huge p o l i t i c a l advantage that it can be examined  and challenged  in the public arena or a court of law because we share a common language for discussing i t . in a p o l i t i c a l sense the most rational a t t i t u d e is to regard an obscure technical argument as simply a hostage to fortune.

　　finally there is the ancient problem of personal values and interests. i believe that the development of much of mathematics and the natural sciences would have arrived more or less as it is if the b e l i e f s   p o l i t i c s and values of the discoverers had been d i f f e r e n t . we might have had a d i f f e r e n t selection of discoveries  but not a contradictory selection. this is certainly not true of personal judgement or social policy. efforts to achieve harmony must recognise differences of value. it is here that mathematical techniques have been at t h e i r weakest. to be sure there are  objective1 quantitative notions of personal u t i l i t y and economic r a t i o n a l i t y but they are  in the view of many  unreliable and unconvincing. 
　　i conclude that certain aspects of human judgement are flawed  but the mathematical tools which may claim to correct or assist judgement are too abstract t o substitute for i t e n t i r e l y   too u n i n t e l l i g i b l e for us to know what they do and do not address  and too neutral to be confident that they protect our interests rather than those of others. 
the contribution of ai 
　　so what does a l l t h i s have to do with a r t i f i c i a l intelligence  ai claims to offer a radically new framework for understanding the manifestations of intelligence. judgement is one such 
manifestation. could ai offer a d i f f e r e n t sort of technology for making judgements that is more compatible with human understanding  could it l e t us build a new generation of harmony machines without the vices of the old  
　　the most prominent practical development in a r t i f i c i a l intelligence so far has been the introduction of expert systems. expert systems  it is said  use 'knowledge' to give assistance in specialised problem solving and decision making. many people see knowledge based systems as providing new capabilities for making decisions  interpreting information  planning and designing  and even making s c i e n t i f i c and commercial innovations. some see a role for knowledge based systems in the formulation of law and social l e g i s l a t i o n . 
　　the technical capabilities of expert systems are probably only a l i t t l e 
　　ahead  and in some ways behind  the capabilities of classical mathematical systems. the importance of knowledge based systems  however  is not t h e i r current achievements but in the way that they solve problems and some side effects of the techniques they use rather than t h e i r current c a p a b i l i t i e s . these features might address the the problems that i have outlined. 
　　expert systems emphasise knowledge  not numbers. ai workers have an idea of what knowledge i s   or at least a p a r t i a l one. the information that an expert system uses is primarily q u a l i t a t i v e   including  facts' such as: 
hopelessness is a cause of social alienation 
and  rules* l i k e : 
if client is unemployed 
and period of unemployment of client is long 
and opportunity of employment is low 
　then r i s k of social alienation of client is high  the syntax of these fragments is that of the props package developed at the imperial cancer research fund. 
capitalised terms are variables.  
　　there are several consequences of representing knowledge in t h i s way. 
　　f i r s t   the emphasis on qualitative facts and rules of thumb expresses f a i r l y d i r e c t l y what we know  or at least what we think we know. qualitative statements are imprecise  but they r e f l e c t ordinary thinking. precision is often an i l l u s i o n or irrelevant anyway. brian gaines has a nice comment that there is l i t t l e point in saying that something   w i l l be delivered at gate no 1 at 1 on saturday morning  when a l l you mean is it   w i l l be dropped off round the back over the weekend . the apparent precision of calculation may merely give an a i r of r a t i o n a l i t y without i t s substance. 
　　extensions of such ideas l e t us represent the meaning of the concepts referred to in the rules and facts. as more and more rules and facts about 
 unemployment   	 opportunity   	 social alienation  are added the computer becomes more and more able to use the concepts in ways which are isomorphic with the ways in which we use them. if the concepts are complex and varied  then the computer's representation of them is complex and varied. the a b i l i t y to represent the details and idiosyncrasies of the problem is greater than if we l i m i t ourselves to formal idealised models. 
　　dreyfus  weizenbaum and searle  deny that t h i s is  true meaning  in a human sense  but even if t h i s is correct  which many question  it is an observation which may have l i t t l e force. if the computer behaves in such a way that people can understand and even predict then the practical consequences are that i t s actions are i n t e l l i g i b l e . 
　　this i n t e l l i g i b i l i t y is a pivotal point for the present argument  as well as expert systems generally. we may consider these fragments of knowledge  and assert that they are s i m p l i s t i c   inconsequential or j u s t plain wrong. quite possibly  but l i t t l e or no t r a i n i n g in computer science is required to understand  and therefore challenge  the judgements they embody. although they are in effect fragments of a computer program  they are i n t e l l i g i b l e 
　　fragments that can be examined and debated. 
　　a side effect of representing knowledge in t h i s way is that the computer system becomes accountable to those it affects. it is well known that one of the features of expert systems is that they can give explanations. if i want to know how a conclusion or recommendation is arrived at i can ask. the computer must report the facts that it assumed and the l i n e of reasoning it followed. admittedly current techniques of explanation are primitive but they w i l l improve - and my experience is that an expert system's clumsy attempts at explanation are more understandable than many legal documents that i encounter. 
　　knowledge based systems w i l l be more credibly competent  or openly laughable  than t h e i r predecessors. the potential for argument  challenge and the exercise of individual discretion are thereby increased  and the commissioners  designers and operators of the machinery of policy become more accountable. interestingly  the habit of explanation could be catching. refusal of insurance cover; imposition of zoning regulations; taxation demands; denial of promotion or citizenship; public statements of 
j. fox 1 
changes to f i s c a l policy  or announcements of public works  would increasingly be expected to be accompanied by i n t e l l i g i b l e documents of explanation. a future freedom of information act might i n s i s t upon i t . 
　　finally  how do we analyse individual values  we can't  at least not e n t i r e l y . ai does not solve a l l the deep problems of philosophy. however even if our understanding of such matters is sketchy  a knowledge based system could s t i l l allow for   i f not f u l l y comprehend  individual values or attitudes. to give just one example we might imagine a home computer asking  which is more important to you  having your baby at home near your family and friends  or within reach of trained staff in case of problems   and r e f l e c t i n g the answer in i t s advice. 
　　i think t h i s a l l boils down to the p o s s i b i l i t y that  contrary to many expectations  ai could be a l i b e r a t i n g force. the influence of technology and the mechanical handling of information are growing at a rapid rate. many of these influences are hidden by v i r t u e of t h e i r incomprehensibility. a i   properly managed  could lead to needed checks and balances in a technology based society  and more participation by i t s members in the formation of p o l i c i e s . 
conclusions and caveats 
　　as we are increasingly dominated by complexity and change we need help to predict and control t h e i r consequences. one response is to introduce rational mathematical tools. but by themselves these tools are too alien to gain much ground  and where they are used they are l i a b l e to improper or unaccountable use. there are areas where technique can enhance judgement and policy making  but technique w i l l only be acceptable if it r e f l e c t s human understanding and is accountable to human authority. it is worth exploring what ai techniques have to offer. 
　　however the huge growth of interest in ai has not been driven by l i b e r a l aspirations  but by commercial ones. many of us feel that t h i s has unbalanced i t s development. most of the technical community is far more interested in the new c a p a b i l i t i e s   the new efficiencies and the new markets that ai seems to offer than the social benefits. although the administrators of research programmes and organisations established 1 j. fox 
to foster the development of ai appear to be sympathetic to the idea that it should be exploited for social as well as economic benefit the response from technical  social science and p o l i t i c a l groups has been disappointing. i hope that the ijcai panel w i l l contribute to a l t e r i n g t h i s . 
　　i do not suggest that the necessary ai developments are around the corner or w i l l be easily achieved. it must be said that ai is subject to p o l i t i c a l direction and management  and i t s application to socially valuable aims w i l l have to be consciously encouraged. the l i b e r a l i s a t i o n that i think ai could deliver would also be a painful d i s c i p l i n e for our masters; they may prefer obscure mathematics  or nothing at a l l . 
acknowledgement 
　　i wish to thank maggie boden for i n v i t i n g me to prepare t h i s paper  and to take the opportunity of drawing attention to her own paper in the journal of mathematical sociology  1  1  pp 1- 1  which deals with rather similar themes.
