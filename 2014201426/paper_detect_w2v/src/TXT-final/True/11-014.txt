       this short paper o u t l i n e s a methodology f o r generating reasonable d e s c r i p t i o n s   i n r e a l t i m e   of simple v i s u a l s i t u a t i o n s i n v o l v i n g one or two moving objects  hogg 1 . an implementation  based upon t h i s methodology  was constructed by the author at the u n i v e r s i t y of western ontario using a s p a t i a l data camera system d r i v e n by an i n t e r d a t e 1 mini-computer communicating w i t h a decsystem-1. the c a p a b i l i t i e s of t h i s working system are i l l u s t r a t e d by the f o l l o w i n g unmodified e x t r a c t from the computer generated d e s c r i p t i o n of an a c t u a l scenario set in the l a b o r a t o r y . 
 an o b j e c t has appeared at l e f t of scene  c a l l it o b j e c t a. object a has begun moving. object a looks l i k e a person  c a l l it fred. an object has appeared in middle of scene  c a l l it object b. fred placed o b j e c t b in the scene . 
       provided the l e v e l of o v e r a l l i l l u m i n a t i o n remains constant  the implementation generates c o r r e c t d e s c r i p t i o n s of a v a r i e t y of scenarios s i m i l a r to t h a t described above. 
the methodology 
       a s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d p i c t u r e d i f f e r e n c i n g a l g o r ithm is employed to locate moving and  t h e r e f o r e   i n t e r e s t i n g objects in a scene  perceived by a t e l e v i s i o n camera and d i g i t i z e d i n t o an i n t e r n a l image composed of a m a t r i x of l i g h t i n t e n s i t i e s . such images are generated repeatedly  every 1 seconds in the implementation  and d i f f e r e n c e d   in r e a l t i m e   w i t h the image of an i n i t i a l instance of the scene against which d i s t i n c t regions of change are i d e n t i f i e d . in g e n e r a l   an o b j e c t w i l l give r i s e to several changed regions in a s i n g l e image  through p a r t i a l o c c l u s i o n or i n s u f f i c i e n t pronouncement of the object against i t s background. by r e l a t i n g the regions generated from i n d i v i d u a l and successive images  the appearance of objects in the scene can be p o s t u l a t e d and these objects subsequently tracked and p o s s i b l y i d e n t i f i e d . to a s s i s t in t h i s process a simple r e l a t i o n a l theory 
was developed  d e f i n i n g s i z e   shape and p o s i t i o n a l d i f f e r e n c e s between r e g i o n s . tracking is performed by r e l o c a t i n g objects through successive images  at each stage guided by o b j e c t models derived from elementary image features and p o s s i b l y improved by high l e v e l processes. i n p a r t i c u l a r   b y i d e n t i f y i n g movement and shape c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s   the implementation is able to i d e n t i f y a human being and consequently to provide high l e v e l guidance f o r the t r a c k i n g process w i t h a subsequent increase in performance  e s p e c i a l l y when d e a l i n g

       the methodology is based upon a set of procedures through which c o n t r o l cyles during operation. each procedure is responsible f o r recognising instances of a p a r t i c u l a r concept  c h a r a c t e r i s i n g such instances by a set of assertions and perhaps producing a d e s c r i p t i v e output sentence. thus    i   low l e v e l feature e x t r a c t i o n   i n c l u d i n g image g e n e r a t i o n   and   i i   higher l e v e l r e c o g n i t i o n processes  may be c l o s e l y i n t e g r a t e d w i t h i n a uniform procedural r e p r e s e n t a t i o n . previous c o n t r i b u t i o n s in r e l a t e d f i e l d s have tended to concentrate in one of these areas and assumed the o t h e r   thereby avoiding many of the problems but as a consequence unable to r e a l i s e the b e n e f i t s of a j o i n t c o n s i d e r a t i o n  potter 1  badler 1 . during o p e r a t i o n   the combined sets of assertions maintained by each procedure c o n s t i t u t e an e v o l v i n g r e p r e s e n t a t i o n   any instance of which provides a d e t a i l e d d e s c r i p t i o n of the current s t a t e of the w o r l d i n c l u d i n g object l o c a t i o n s   
motion p r i m i t i v e s and the higher l e v e l s i t u a t i o n s in which these objects are p r e s e n t l y i n v o l v e d . this r e p r e s e n t a t i o n serves both as a medium f o r communication between procedures  enabling the r e p r e s e n t a t i o n i t s e l f to e v o l v e   and as a source of immediate high l e v e l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n f o r an observer. 
summary 
¡¡¡¡¡¡the working system demonstrates the f e a s i b i l i t y of 	the methodology and  	in p a r t i c u l a r   	t h a t 
high l e v e l guidance of t r a c k i n g increases both r e l i a b i l i t y and e f f i c i e n c y and can be implemented e a s i l y when both h i g h and low l e v e l processes are represented uniformly as procedures. an important consequence of the proposed methodology is the support it lends to the s u p p o s i t i o n t h a t c e r t a i n s i g n i f i c a n t concepts i n v o l v i n g motion can be recognised in a scene w i t h o u t the need f o r an extensive analysis of i n d i v i d u a l instances of the scene. 
       in c o n c l u s i o n   the conceptual framework and procedural r e p r e s e n t a t i o n   only o u t l i n e d i n t h i s short paper  are e s s e n t i a l l y independent of the basic p i c t u r e operators and m i g h t   t h e r e f o r e   provide a u s e f u l foundation f o r f u t u r e research  when more s o p h i s t i c a t e d p i c t u r e operators w i l l undoubtedly be employed.
