introduction 
   weighted techniques in h e u r i s t i c search have been i n v e s t i g a t e d by s e v e r a l researchers   e . g .   see -   1     . although thoes methods made the aearch more e f f i c i e n c y   the improvement is r a t h e r l i m i t t e d because weights are u s u a l l y added to a l l nodes u n d i c r i m i n a l l y   f o r example  in  1  the  same 
weight 	x 	is applied 	to each node.

   the a l t e r n a t i v e weighted technique presented here is the f o l l o w i n g . according to d e c i s i o n s made by some s t a t i s t i c i n f e r e n c e method d u r i n g a  or a*  search a weight w i l l only be added to the e v a l u a t i o n of some nodes which are u n l i k e l y in the s o l u t i o n p a t h . it r e s u l t s in a new weighted technique t h a t w i l l p r o v i d e b e t t e r r e s u l t s . 
a new weighted method 
   as shown in   1     under c e r t a i n c o n d i t i o n s we examine search as a s t a t i s t i c sampling process so that s t a t i s t i c i n f e r e n c e method can be used during the search. assume the wald s e q u e n t i a l p r o b a b i l i t y radio t e s t  sprt  is used as a t e s t ing hypotheses. in some searching stage  if the hypothesis t h a t some subtree t c o n t a i n s s o l u t i o n path is r e j e c t e d   from  1  i t ' s known t h a t subtree t c o n t a i n s the goal w i t h lower p r o b a b i l i t y . rather than p r u n i n g t  as in   a f i x e d weight w is added to the e v a l u a t i o n f u n c t i o n of nodes in t  i . e .   f   n   = f   n   + w . if the hypothesis t h a t the 
subtree t' c o n t a i n s the g o a l is accepted  the same weight is added to a l l nodes in the b r o t h e r subtrees of t1 which r o o t s are the b r o t h e r s of the r o o t of tv. if no d e c i s i o n can be made the search process is continued as in a search. thus the search w i l l concentrate on the subtrees which c o n t a i n 	the goal w i t h higher p r o b a b i l i t y due to the w e i g h t i n g . 	this new a l g o r i t h m 	is c a l l e d the weighted sa search-wsa. 
the complexity of wsa 
   assume the search 	space is a uniform m-ary t r e e   	the sprt is used as the t e s t i n g hypotheses and 	the given s i g n i f i c a n c e l e v e l 	is 
 the c o m p l e x i t y of an a l g o r i t h m is defined as the expected number of nodes expanded by the a l g o r i t h m when a goal is f o u n d . we 	have proved 	the f o l l o w i n g 	theorems 	  t h e p r o o f is 
presented 	in 	the appendix . 
	theorem 1: assume 	c is 
a known c o n s t a n t   n is the depth at which the goal i s l o c a t e d   p a  i s the c o m p l e x i t y o f a l g o r i t h m a when it searches the same space. using

procedure as follows: 
　 1  create a l i s t called open. expand initial node 1   generating its m successors  put them on open. 
create a l i s t closed  it's initially empty. 
　　　create a l i s t roots. put m successors of s on i t   the node in roots is called a. 
　 1  loop: if open is empty  exit with failure  it's impossible that open is empty when there exists a goal in the search tree . 
　 1  select the first node on open  remove it from open  and put it on closed. call this node 
n. 
　 1  if n is a goal  exit successfully with the solution obtained by tracing a path along the pointers which are established in step 1. 
　 1  expand node n  generating its m successors  put them on open.establish a pointer to n from these successors. 
　 1  if some subtree t a  is accepted according to some testing hypothese  add a weight w to the statistics of all nodes in the brother-subtree of t a   remove the root nodes of t a  and its brother-subtrees from roots and put their successors on roots. 
　 1  reorder the l i s t open according to statistics. go loop. 
conclusions 
　a new weighted technique is incorporated in a  or a*  search. while the algorithm a searches a space using evaluation function f n   some weight w is added to f n   f  n =f n +w  of the nodes which are unlikely in  the solution path according to decisions made by some statistic inference method. thus the paths that contain the goal with higher probability will be expanded more due to the weighting. 
　in a uniform m-ary tree  we show that a goal can be found by wsa in the polynomial time  although the complexity of a may be 1 e   for searching the same space. 
　both algorithm a  1  and sa are special cases of this more general algorithm wsa. note that when w =1 algorithm wsa is idential to a search. while w = +oo algorithm wsa degenerates into sa search. 
appendix 
the proof of theorem 1: 
　for simplicity  we assume the search space is a uniform 1-ary tree  m-1  in the following discussion. there is no loss of generality in assuming that p a =e cn 
　if a statistic decision is made in some search stage a weight w is added to evaluation of nodes of the rejected subtrees. a subtree is called a completely weighted if all its subtrees have been decided to be rejected or accepted. the subtree shown in fig.1 is completely weighted  where the rejected subtrees are marked with sign  x   . 
　obviously  a completely weighted subtree has more expanded nodes than the incompletely weight-
