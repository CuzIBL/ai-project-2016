 
       discourse is both about the world and an accomplishment in the world. this f a c t has led to two approaches to the study of discourse in a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e   one i n v e s t i g a t i n g   t e x t plans*'  the other  world p l a n s   . by analyzing a fragment of a n a r r a t i v e in which both kinds of plans f i g u r e i m p o r t a n t l y   we explore the r e l a t i o n s h i p between the two kinds of plans  l o o k i n g toward a synthesis of the two approaches. 
	1. 	two views of plans 	in 	discourse 
       recently  n a t u r a l language discourse has been analyzed in terms of the a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e 
       n o t i o n of planning. but the plans have been of two d i s t i n c t s o r t s   and t h i s d i s t i n c t i o n has given the f i e l d two approaches. 
       those using the f i r s t approach hypothesize about the plans that the p a r t i c i p a n t s in a dialogue or the w r i t e r of a t e x t must have. bruce  1   schmidt  1   and cohen and p e r r a u l t  1   f o r example  i n v e s t i g a t e the plans a dialogue system would have to generate to perform f e l i c i t o u s i n d i v i d u a l speech a c t s . a l l e n and p e r r a u l t  1  develop processes that would a l l o w a l i s t e n e r to recognize a speaker's plan to perform a p a r t i c u l a r speech act. there have also been attempts to extend the planning metaphor to l a r g e r stretches of d i s c o u r s e . the f i r s t author  hobbs 1  has sought to i n t e r p r e t the s t r u c t u r e that many i n v e s t i g a t o r s f i n d in discourse   e . g . grimes 1  longacre 1  as means by which a speaker can r e a l i z e goals of a   t e x t u a l   or   l i s t e n e r - d i r e c t e d   n a t u r e . winograd  1  and levy  1  also demonstrate how the s t r u c t u r e of discourse can r e s u l t from the speaker's goals i n t a l k i n g . recently we have been analyzing conversations in terms of the p a r t i c i p a n t s ' developing plans f o r c a r r y i n g on the conversation  hobbs and evans 1  agar and hobbs 1a. agar and hobbs 1b  hobbs and agar 1 . in a l l of t h i s work  the speaker is assumed viewed as using some kind of planning 
mechanism to generate plans whose actions are the utterances in the dialogue or the sentences in the t e x t . we w i l l c a l l these plans   t e x t plans  and the approach the   t e x t approach . 
       by c o n t r a s t   those using the other approach e x p l i c a t e the plans of the characters in the story i t s e l f . for example  schank and abelson  1  show how knowledge of people's t y p i c a l goals can be used t o understand s t o r i e s about t h e i r a c t i v i t i e s . wilensky  1  examines s t o r i e s b u i l t around the c o n f l i c t i n g goals and plans of c h a r a c t e r s . bruce and newman  1   bruce  1   and beaugrande  1  a l l analyze t r a d i t i o n a l s t o r i e s o r l i t e r a r y works in terms of the c h a r a c t e r s ' i n i t i a l goals and michael agar

t h e i r developing plans to r e a l i z e the g o a l s . related to t h i s work is the i n v e s t i g a t i o n of how the plan f o r accomplishing a task can s t r u c t u r e a dialogue about the task  grosz 1  hobbs and robinson 1 . in c o g n i t i v e anthropology there has been a s i m i l a r i n t e r e s t in d i s c o v e r i n g from discourse some of the c e n t r a l plans in people's l i v e s   including work by the second author  agar 1  and by hutchins  1 . in a l l these examples the plans are concerned not w i t h  how to t a l k   but w i t h  how to d o   . they are plans f o r achieving goals in the w o r l d   not in the t e x t   and we w i l l r e f e r to them as  world p l a n s     and to the approach as the   w o r l d approach . 
           those adopting the t e x t approach t y p i c a l l y see understanding discourse as a bottom-up  d a t a d i r e c t e d process. that is  it has been easier to s t a t e how possible i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s are constrained by the discourse i t s e l f than by one's expectations about its s t r u c t u r e . theories of t e x t s t r u c t u r e have e i t h e r had too l i t t l e coverage  as w i t h s t o r y grammars  rumelhart 1  and dialogue games  mann  moore and levin 1   or they have been i n s u f f i c i e n t l y c o n s t r a i n i n g   a s i s the f i r s t a u t h o r ' s coherence theory  hobbs 1 . in g e n e r a l   t e x t plans are ephemeral. they are not u s u a l l y constructed out of large p r e s t r u c t u r e d pieces. rather  they are b u i l t  on the f l y   i n response to unique s i t u a t i o n s . consequently  the major problem w i t h the t e x t approach is that several equally p l a u s i b l e coherence s t r u c t u r e s may f i t the d a t a   and a great deal of inferenclng might be required to discover any of them. 
       those adopting the world approach t y p i c a l l y view comprehension of a t e x t as guided by l a r g e   p r e s t r u c t u r e d plans that are simply i n s t a n t i a t e d 
       f o r the occasion. to i n t e r p r e t an utterance is to determine what step or steps in the world plan the utterance r e f e r s t o . this approach provides very strong c o n s t r a i n t s on possible i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s of u t t e r a n c e s . the major problem  however  is that we are not g e n e r a l l y given the r e l e v a n t plan at the beginning of a t e x t . the l i s t e n e r or reader has to pick the a p p r o p r i a t e plan from a l a r g e c o l l e c t i o n of possible p l a n s   or more f r e q u e n t l y   has to construct a new p l a n f o r the occasion. the world approach doesn't say how t h i s is done. 
       for the past year  we have been analyzing fragments from a l a r g e corpus of ethnographic l i f e h i s t o r y i n t e r v i e w s   attempting t o b r i n g formal approaches t o discourse developed i n a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e to bear on the problems of c o g n i t i v e anthropology. in the course of our research we have found it u s e f u l to analyze our t e x t s both in terms of the t e x t plans and the w o r l d plans t h a t are e x h i b i t e d . this raises a n a t u r a l q u e s t i o n : what is the r e l a t i o n s h i p between the two approaches to d i s c o u r s e   between t e x t plans and world plans  in t h i s paper  we focus on one fragment of an 

interview in which both world plans and text plans figure importantly  and we explore their relationship  in an attempt to bring about a synthesis between the two approaches to discourse. 
　　　the conclusion we arrive at has important consequences for discourse understanding systems. each approach can be seen to aid in the solution of the major problem in the other approach. the text structure  especially in the pattern of elaborations  frequently highlights c r i t i c a l areas of the world plan that must be constructed in interpreting a text. conversely  where the text plan is ambiguous  the world plan that has been developed imposes the most constraints. 
　　　as w i l l be obvious  there is no system that is capable of performing the analysis that we present  nor do we have any intention of trying to implement such a system. rather our effort is to use the sophisticated formalisms developed in a r t i f i c i a l intelligence to make sense of complex data that another field must grapple with  and in that context  to investigate the mapping between text and world  toward a synthesis of the two dominant views of discourse in a i . 
	1. 	the data 
　　　the fragment we analyze comes from a series of l i f e history interviews with a 1-year-old career heroin addict in new york  whom we w i l l call jack  collected by the second author in 1  agar 1 . in the particular interview this fragment is taken from  jack is t e l l i n g how  in 1  he became a burglar. in his global plan for t e l l i n g the story  he must f i r s t t e l l how he met johnny  the man who taught him burglary. johnny is i n i t i a l l y portrayed as naive in the ways of the world  u n t i l halfway through the interview  when  during jack's account of the f i r s t burglary  johnny emerges as extremely competent. much of the impact of the story derives from this contrast. 
　　　the fragment below describes his f i r s t encounter with johnny. jack has just stolen some luggage at penn station containing a pair of gloves he is now trying to fence. he has located a fence by the name of frenchy in a cafeteria. with frenchy are two  kids   one of whom turns out to be johnny. the fragment goes as follows: 
 1  now s i t t i n g with him  frenchy  were two young kids  
 1  they couldn't have been over 1 if they were that old  
 1  probably 1  1  
 1  bright-eyed kids  
 1  obviously not new yorkers  
 1  and they were talking at the top of their voices  
 1  why man  i- you know  blah blah blah  
 1  i got this guy before he knew what had happened  
 1  and man i had his watch 
 1  and man did you see the r o l l - his r o l l of b i l l s he had  
 1  and one guy is flashing a diamond ring out from underneath the table  
 1  he's flashing it up above the table. 
 1  meanwhile frenchy's called me to come over and s i t at the table with him  
 1  so you know  i looked at these two kids 
 1  and i sat down at the table 
 1  and i was just in no mood to listen to a lot of bullshit. 
 1  so 1 turned to the kids  
 1  1 said  hey look you guys  why don't you just soft pedal i t . 
 1  i said  i don't know what your story is and i care less  
 1  but you're making a general display of yourself. 
 1  this place is loaded with rats. 
 1  i t ' s only a matter of time u n t i l a cop comes in and busts the whole table  
 1  i told frenchy  i said  frenchy  what the fuck is the matter with you  
 1  you know  i said  why don't you t e l l these dudes to- to shut up. 
 1  but jack  they've got blah blah blah  you know  
 1  and i want to get this stuff  
 1  i said well look  i said you guys may not care if you go to j a i l   
 1  but i do. 
 1  i said i spend 1 percent of my time trying to stay out of j a i l   
 1  and i don't want anybody to come up here and bother us. 
　　　before getting into the detailed analysis it w i l l be useful to clarify the nature of our problem by casting it into a framework of levels developed by bruce  1  and illustrated in figure 1. at level 1  we have the real speaker  jack  and the real listener  mike. however  when they enter into a conversation they become an  implied speaker  and an  implied listener   by restricting the knowledge bases they build the conversation on top of to the knowledge they believe they share. we may c a l l the speaker in this fragment jack1. in constructing his narrative  he is developing a narrative plan on the basis of his 1 knowledge about  among other things  how to maintain coherence  how to t e l l a good story  and what his listener knows  in addition to knowledge of the content of the story. on the other hand  the main character in his story  whore we may c a l l jack1  is acting out the steps in developing plans to obtain money and avoid arrest. he is using his expertise as a hustler  his knowledge of the times square area  and his knowledge about social relationships* a l l of this knowledge is contained in the knowledge base that jack1 is using  but the reverse is not true  of course. jack1 has jack1's world plan in mind and develops a text plan  whose purpose is to convey it to his listener. his listener witnesses the execution of jack1's text plan and uses what he perceives to recover jack1's world plan  in part by discerning jack1's text plan  though not 
necessarily consciously . 
　　　it w i l l be clearest if we proceed by f i r s t laying out the principal world plans that figure at level 1. we do this in section 1. then in section 
1 we consider the problems jack1 has in generating a story that conveys these plans adequately  and the coherence devices he uses  that is  the text plan he constructs  in order to solve these 
1 

problems. in section 1 we close with a few observations about the relationship between the two kinds of plans* 
figure 1. 	levels in jack's story. 
	1. 	the world plans 
　　　before describing the specific plans that are relevant to our data  we w i l l describe the simple planning formalism we assume. first of a l l   it w i l l simplify things if we collapse causality and implication into the single relation  
 implication   represented by   -     . implication is a relation between propositions  whereas causality is a relation between events. however  an event can be  described  by a proposition. what we w i l l mean when we say that one event e1 implies  -   another event e1 is that there is a proposition pi that describes event e1 occurring at time t1 and there is a time t1 after t1 and another proposition p1 that describes event e1 occurring at time t1  and p1 implies p1. since our plans do not involve intricate temporal factors  we can get away with this simplification. 
　　　we w i l l assume a knowledge base that includes a number of rules of the form  p -  q   where p and q are propositions. we assume some of the rules to be in focus at any given instant. a plan is an and-or tree that is constructed as follows. there is some goal proposition go at the root. 
given a goal or subgoal proposition g  there is a conjunctive branch from g to subgoals p1  . . .   pn  for a l l rules of the form  not-pi--   not-g  that are in focus. for one or more rules  gi -  g   there is a  disjunctive  branch from g to the subgoal e  1 i .  the pi's are the preconditions; gl is the means by which the goal g is or could be accomplished.  if there is a rule  g -  s  in focus and g is a goal or subgoal in the plan  then s is a known side-effect of the plan  represented in the diagrams below by a horizontal arrow. 
　　　there are three plans that play an important role in this fragment. the f i r s t is the plan jack brings into the situation - his plan to get money from the fence for the goods he has stolen. the plan is illustrated in figure 1. jack's goal is to have money. in order to obtain money  he wants to exchange the gloves for money with frenchy. in order to do this  he f i r s t has to steal the gloves  which he has done. then he must be with frenchy. this much of the plan is probably prestructured  since it is something jack has done often  and it is just instantiated for the occasion with frenchy in the  fence slot  and the gloves in the  goods slot . 
　　　but there is a basic rule of social interaction that becomes relevant in this situation. it says that if you are with someone who is with someone else  then you are with that someone else.  with  is transitive. 
　　 a x y z  with x y  & with  y z  -  with x z   since frenchy is already with the kids  jack's plan has the side-effect of jack's being with the kids. figure 1 illustrates a l l this.  branches in a l l the diagrams are conjunctive unless otherwise indicated.  

　　　the second relevant plan responds to a maintenance goal that jack always has - avoiding arrest. here he presumably builds his plan on the f l y in response to the situation out of individual rules of plausible inference encoding his knowledge of how the world works. the crucial rule is that when the police arrest someone  then everyone with him is generally arrested too. 

the other relevant facts are the facts about the police that if they know someone has done an illegal act  they w i l l generally arrest him  assuming they are in a position to do so   

and the fact that if a  rat  hears someone t e l l about an i l l e g a l act  he w i l l generally t e l l it to the police  

in addition we need two facts about speaking. saying something results in the hearer's knowing i t : 
1 
 a x y z  say x1y z  -  know y z   
if you say tomething near someone else  that person w i l l frequently hear you; 
 a x y z w  say x y z  & near w x -- hear w x z   
out of these pieces we can build jack's plan to avoid arrest  shown in figure 1* we assume a typical rat r to avoid irrelevant complexities with quantified variables. 
　　　for referential convenience  we c a l l this  plan i i   and number the subgoals as indicated. 
　　　two of the plan's terminal nodes conflict with reality. the kids are openly admitting a mugging  and as jack1 say1  there are rats nearby. the other terminal node conflicts with the side effect of jack1's f i r s t plan. if he is to be with frenchy to fence the goods  he must be with the kids. 
　　　in order to resolve this conflict  he could either give up his f i r s t plan and therefore not be with the kids  or he could make everyone go someplace that wasn't  crawling with rats   or he could cause the kids to stop talking about the mugging. the last is obviously the cheapest alternative  and jack1's third plan has that as i t s goal. it is actually an extension of subgoal 1 i n plan i i . 
　　　he could normally expect the kids to have the goal of avoiding arrest too  and to know that their display risked arrest  but evidently this presumed plan of theirs was breaking down. either they didn't have the goal or they didn't know the risk. the two actions jack takes are to explain the risk to the kids   1  -  1   by laying out the chief elements of plan i i   and to emphasize the importance of the goal   1  -  1 . in addition  he tries an indirect cure by accusing frenchy of f a l l i n g in his responsibility to keep the kids quiet. we won't represent this plan formally since it would take us too deep into a notatlonal morass. 
　　　there are other goals and plans that figure in this story  including frenchy's plan to get the goods from jack  his plan to get the diamond ring and money from the kids  and his own goal of avoiding arrest. frenchy faces his own goal conflict between getting the prime goods that the kids have to offer and avoiding the arrest that their behavior invites. he solves it in a different way than jack does  by deciding that getting the goods is important enough to risk arrest for  as he says in utterances  1  -  1 . the potential gain outweighs the risk in frenchy's case in a way that it doesn't for jack. part of frenchy's plan must involve a decision not to t e l l off the kids as jack does  because it could be taken as an insult and jeopardize the deal. 
　　　the kids bring their own plans into the scene  f i r s t their plan to get money for their goods  and second the plan that must underlie their display. it might seem strange to call the display planned behavior  rather than something that results from their character  but as carbonell  1  has shown  character traits can be analyzed into propensities to exhibit certain kinds of goal-directed behavior. moreover  there is evidence in utterances  1  and  1  that jack is treating their behavior as planned. 
　　　the final plans at level 1 are jack's text plans that he executes when he talks to the kids and to frenchy  generating the internal structure of those sequences of utterances. these we discuss in the next section. 
	1. 	the text plan 
　　　the analysis in this section presupposes a familiarity with the coherence theory developed by the f i r s t author  hobbs 1  1 . briefly  it says that a speaker has various coherence relations  such as elaboration  contrast  and explanation  that he can use to organize his discourse so that it w i l l be comprehensible  and that in comprehension a listener recognizes these coherence relations  though not necessarily consciously  by drawing inferences satisfying certain general constraints. 
　　　let us take jack1's view of the problem of generating the story. he has to indicate the two d i f f i c u l t i e s in plan ii - that jack1 should not be with the kids  and that they are making a dangerous display of themselves. 
1 　　　utterance  1  expresses both significant facts - that frenchy was with the kids  and that the kids were young. the former remains on hold for a 
　　　time while jack develops the latter  but it turns out later to be a significant piece of information. in utterances  1  -  1  jack develops the theme of the kids' youth through a series of elaborations but the way in which it is elaborated is significant. first of a l l   in utterances  1  and  1   he gets more specific about their ages  and adds l i t t l e that is new. in utterance  1   however  he calls them  bright-eyed   and to recognize this as an elaboration of the  youth  theme we must find something youth and bright-eyedness have in common. there are many possibilities  but one of them is a careless naivete. finally we learn in utterance  1  that they are  obviously not new yorkers . for knowledgeable new yorkers  which both jack1 and agar are  this statement conveys a lack of knowledge of the ways of new york. to see this as an elaboration of the youth theme  we must draw the inference about youth and bright-eyed-ness that when one is young and bright-eyed  one is likely to lack street knowledge* thus  utterances  i  -  1  are tied together by a theme that could be characterised as  frenchy was with two young and hence non-streetwise kids'*. this theme is important since jack1's f i r s t attempt to overcome the goal conflict involves correcting the kids' lack of knowledge  and in fact the whole story of how jack became a burglar is built around the contrast between johnny's i n i t i a l seeming ignorance and his subsequently revealed competence as a burglar. the fact that jack1 gives the 
 unknowledgeable youth  theme such rich development indicates that it plays a crucial role in the story he is t e l l i n g . 
　　　this is an important point  and it suggests how the notion of the  evaluative structure  of a story  introduced by polanyl  1   needs to be extended. polanyl studied the use of various discourse devices  such as linguistic markers  and argued that these devices  evaluate   in the sense of  indicate the importance or value of   the important portions of a narrative. the extension of the concept of evaluation suggested by our data is that it la not just linguistic markers that evaluate  but the elaborative coherence structure i t s e l f . moreover  what is evaluated is material that points to crucial areas of the underlying world plan that must be constructed by the listener. 
　　　let us return to the analysis. having characterised the kids  jack1 next describes their behavior in utterances  1  -  1 . among the principal inferences that must be associated with character t r a i t s are inferences about the typical behaviors that the character traits result in 
  carbonell 1 . thus the relationship between  1  -  1  and  1  -  1  can be seen as one of general statement - specific instance. jack has told us what the kids are like in a way that t e l l s us that this information is important. now he gets spacific about why it is important. we learn two things. first we learn in  1  that they are talking ao loud that they could easily be overheard  pointing toward a violation of aubgoal 1 in plan i i . then in  1  -  1  we learn that they are talking about illegal a c t i v i t i e s   f i l l i n g in more crucial information in the violation of that plan. this is probably enough for someone reasonably familiar with the domain to construct at least the branch of plan ii from aubgoal 1 to aubgoal 1. within this segment there is a build-up in intensity. in  1  the kid makes a statement that could be interpreted ambiguously. in  1   1  there is an explicit admission of a mugging. 
this could s t i l l be mere braggadocio  but in  1   1  the goods are actually displayed. the nearly identical repetition we find in  1  and  1  again evaluates or marks as important the information conveyed by these utterances. jack1 shows us that the kids' lack of knowledgeability leads them to 
engage in very dangerous behavior. 
　　　this leaves jack1 with the  with  theme to develop - the problematic right branch of plan i i . 
in utterances  1  -  1  he gives us a very interesting counterpunctual development of the goal conflict surrounding the  with  relationship. in fact  we can view jack1's moves here as an attempt to block the transitivity of  with . utterances  1  and  1  serve to establish his  with  relationship with frenchy  while the alternating utterances   1  and  1  -  1   aerve to distance him from the kids. they emphasise jack's orientation toward the kids and thus call it into question. utterance  1  indicates that jack is making a judgment  perhaps about their character and behavior and i t s possible effects on him. utterance  1  provides a negative evaluation of their behavior  and utterance  1  again emphasizes his orientation toward them. jack1 could have conveyed the bare information simply by saying  
so i sat down with frenchy and i said to the k i d s . . .   
by spinning it out at greater length  he gives the listener a sense of the conflict involved in the situation and jack1's hesitation about entering i t . 
　　　this segment is an interesting i l l u s t r a t i o n of how the hard facts about arrest and the l i f e of a hustler interact with subtle factors of social interaction and get reflected in the fine details of social behavior and descriptions of social behavior. 
　　　now jack1 begins to speak and the distinction between level 1 and level 1 disappears. if jack1 remembered exactly what jack1 had said  then his text plan would be merely t h i s : describe t e l l i n g 
　　　the kids about the risk; describe asking frenchy for an explanation; describe telling the kids about arrest. but it is not likely that jack1 remembers  so he must construct a plausible text plan for jack1 to execute. hence we collapse jack1 and jack1 into simply jack. 
	we can 	almost read 	the text 	plan off 	world 
plan i i . jack begins in  1  by t e l l i n g them subgoal 1 e x p l i c i t l y . the rest of the segment   1  -  1   functions  in terms of the text plan  as an explanation for subgoal 1. in terms of the world plan  the explanation is simply the higher subgoals in the tree. thus  utterance  1  says that subgoal 1 is not being satisfied  utterance 
 1  says 	the same 	for subgoal 	1  and 	utterance 
 1  draws the conclusion that subgoal 1 may f a l l . by referring to  the whole table   jack points to the real problem for him  to which he gives further development in  1  -  1  - subgoal 1. the contrastive coherence relation between  1  and  1  -  1  highlights the importance of the latter:  i don't know the explanation for this  but 
whatever it is doesn't justify this display.  
　　　the coherence structure of this segment is illustrated in figure 1. the inferences that had to be drawn to recognise this could for the most part have been read off of plan i i   and it is d i f f i c u l t to imagine how  in the absence of the world plan  the coherence of some of the utterances  such as the deep parallelism between 
1  1  and  1   could have been discovered at a l l   
　　　in the final segment of the fragment  utterances  1  -  1   we see another interesting interaction between text plan and world plan  for the segment uses various coherence relations to evaluate heavily the top goal in plan ii instead of just giving the bare information  
i don't want to get arrested  
as he finally does in utterance  1   he f i r s t gives an explanation of this desire as following from a general principle  1   which he evaluates or highlights by a contrast with  1  and by elaborating it in  1  as being before him most of the time. 
	1. 	the relationship 
　　　the text plan  or equlvalently the coherence structure  of a passage is the trace of the speaker's decisions about how to travel about the world plan or other knowledge structure he is trying to convey. our analysis has yielded information about two kinds of decisions: 
　　　1. how to choose a starting point and how to move from node to node. 
　　　1. why and how to develop a node beyond the simplest statement of its content. 
　　　several solutions to the f i r s t problem seem to be possible. the speaker can start at the top  describing the most global goal  and then elaborate on the plan as he goes along by describing the particular steps implementing the top-level goal. or he can give the most detailed nodes f i r s t and provide the higher nodes by way of explanation. this is what we see in utterances  1  -  1  and 
 1  -  1 .  one interesting feature of this passage  if we take plan ii more seriously than we ought to  is that the intermediate subgoals 1 and 1 in the plan remain unexpressed as obvious and easily inferrable. mann and moore  1  address the issue of omitting such nodes in a description.  alternatively  the speaker could start at the beginning at the most detailed level and proceed in temporal order  producing the so-called normal narrative order. 
　　　the second problem facing the speaker is his choice of nodes in the world plan to which to give a richer development. as we have seen  this richness takes the form of elaborations  contrasts  and parallel examples - the expansion relations. it was suggested in hobbs  1  that the expansion relations reflect the structure of the speaker's knowledge base  so in a sense the speaker develops a point by lingering in one locale of his knowledge base. he provides information inferentially related to the node of the world plan he is developing. this suggests two reasons for giving development to a node. 
　　　the f i r s t is that the node is particularly important for the story and lies in an important and hence richly developed area of the knowledge base  or in an area of listener ignorance  so that an expanded development gives the listener the time and material to absorb it more thoroughly. this is what we have seen in utterances  1  -  1   and on a smaller scale in utterances  1  -  1 . 
　　　the other reason is quite the opposite. if the speaker is in an area of his knowledge base that is not richly developed  and is having d i f f i c u l t y expressing his thoughts  he is likely to take several cuts at i t   trying one expression  repairing or elaborating on that  or giving several parallel examples or a contrasting case. this kind of passage has a very different flavor to i t   however  from the expansions arising from the f i r s t reason. 
　　　our analysis has shown that the relation between text plan and world plan is close but not simple. among other things  the speaker determines which parts of the world plan are most crucial to convey  and evaluates or highlights them through a variety of  expansion  coherence relations such as elaboration  exemplification  and contrast. these expansions provide the listener with repeated opportunities  and we would expect them to dominate the discourse just when the listener could not be expected to have constructed the underlying world plan. on the other hand  once the world plan has been constructed  it can be used for the rapid selection of inferences to support coherence relations whose recognition would otherwise require a great deal of inferential work. 
　　　the interconnections between text plan and world plan are certainly richer and more complex than our investigation of this fragment has revealed. this is something further research w i l l undoubtedly show.
