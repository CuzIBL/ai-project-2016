 
augmented reality is a research area that tries to embody an electronic information space within the real world through computational devices a crucial issue within thus area is the recognition of real world objects or situations in natural language processing  it is much racier to determine interpietations of utterances even if they art ill formed when the context or situation is fixed we therefore introduce robust natural language processing into a sys tern of augmented reality with situation aware ness based on this idea we have developed a portable system called the ubiquitous talkft this consists of an l c d display that reflects the scene at which a user is looking as if it is a transparent glass a ccd camera foi re  ogniz ing real world objects with color bar id i odes a 
microphone for recognizing a human voice and a speaker which outputs a synthesized voice the ubiquitous talker provides its user with some information related to a recognized object by using the display and voice it also accepts requests or questions at. voice inputs the user feels as if he/she is talking with the object itself through the system 
1 	introduction 
there are many situations where we want to interact with the surrounding real world we would also like to communicate with the objects used in our everyday life augmented reality is a research area that tries to incorporate an electronic information space into the real world by means of computational devices1 this approach enriches  rather than replaces the real world  l e a virtual reality  by providing valuable infornia tion  such as descriptions of objects navigational help in plates and instructions for performing physical tasks

¡¡¡¡the term 'augmented reality usually refers to a variant of virtual reality that uses see-through head mounted dis plays to overlay computer generated images on the user s real world view for example  see  feiner et al 1  however we use it here with a more general meauing

augmented reality essentially the ability to ret ognize u a l world objects/situations there are several approaches to situation awareness such as detection of physical objects using visual processing detection of loc ation/oricntation by positioning systems and communi  ation with physic ally embedded computers  1 e ubiq uitous computing  weiser 1   for situation aware ness we employ a coloned barcode system  rekimoto 1  in this system any real world object has a colar bar tag attached to it that makes it easily identifiable 
   on the other hand in order to make natural language processing espcially spoken language processing more practical we must restract or constrain the domains contexts or tasks since e it requires a potentially broad search space on on a phonelic and linguistic level recently then has been a big trend in multimodal approarheh to combine verbal and nonverbal modalities in human c omputer communication various soits of nonverbrall in formation play a role in setting the situational context which is useful in restricting the hypothesis space con structed during language processing when a context or a situation is fixed by using nonverbal information the interpictation of utterances becomes much easiers even if the utterances are ill formed in other words the correct interpretation of natural language utterances sentially requires the integration of both linguistic and non lingustic contexts understanding multimodal dia logues is not possible without some account of the role of the non-linguistic context considering such a con text  results in knowledge bases that are very efficient and robust we have there fore introduced robust natural language processing into a system of augmented reality 
   we have d  ve loped a portable system called the ubiq uitous talkft this consists of an l c d display which presents the view at which a user is looking as if it is a transparent glass a c c d camera for recogmzing real world objects with color bar id codes a microphone for recognizing a human voice  and a spcakter that outputs a synthesized voice the ubiquitous talker augments reality with some additional information related to a rec ognized object/situation such information is conveyed by using the l c d display and voice the system are cepts and interprets user voice requests and questions the user may feel as if he/she is talking with the object itself through the system

¡¡when the system recognizes a real world object for instance a calendar on the wall  the system sends a mes sage such as   today is april 1  1 your schedule is and displays a timetable of the user s schedule then the user asks what about tomorrow ' ' and the ays tern replies your schedule tomorrow is and proceeds as before

to easily recognize real world situations/objects we use a colored barcode system as a real world identification  rekimoto  1  the color -code consists of a number of blue and red stripes that encodes  the id of a real world object 
   an image input from a small ccd  amera is processed in real time by a workstation 	the image recognizer con tmuously scans any objects with the color code the sys tern generates a synthesized d image by superimposing vi sual messages related to the color code on the real world image obtained from the camera the output image is shown on th  l c d display lmag  processing is done by software except for conversion between ntsc video signals and bitmap digital images the output image is updated at a late of 1 frames p  r second 
   recognition of objects can be naturally extended to the recognition of situations suppose that there is an id code on * very door in the building when the user stands in front of a door the system detects where the user is located and may understand what he/she intends to do by scanning the id code on the door and by processing the information located to it
