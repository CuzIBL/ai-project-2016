summary 
       the work reported here is an e x t e n s i o n of e a r l i e r work on a s t a t i s t i c a l theory of v i s u a l t h r e s h o l d s . 
       experiments are reported in which the quantum noise l i m i t a t i o n o f v i s u a l thresholds i s explored 
f u r t h e r by the d e l i b e r a t e a d d i t i o n of noise to the t e s t p a t t e r n s presented to the observers. 	a t h e o r e t i c a l 	framework is developed to account 	f o r the i n f l u e n c e o f t h i s noise and i t i s 	found t h a t e m p i r i c a l observations show the p r i n c i p a l charact e r i s t i c s p r e d i c t e d b y t h i s t h e o r e t i c a l 	framework. 
       this appears to c o n f i r m the v a l i d i t y of t h i s approach t o v i s u a l t h r e s h o l d s . i t also provides a convenient means f o r p r e d i c t i n g the response of the eye when used to observe the output of any imaging system in which noise is p r e s e n t .

       it was f i r s t suggested by barnes and czerny t h a t s t a t i s t i c a l f l u c t u a t i o n s i n the a r r i v a l o f photons might present a l i m i t to the performance of the eye at low l i g h t l e v e l s . the theory was put forward more f o r m a l l y almost simultaneously by two workers  rose and de vries   but the f u l l s t a t i s t i c a l approach was not proposed u n t i l the p u b l i c a t i o n of a now famous paper by rose1 in which the a c t u a l performance of the eye was compared w i t h the highest performance a t t a i n a b l e w i t h an i d e a l d e t e c t o r l i m i t e d to the p h y s i c a l dimensions of the eye   p r i n c i p a l l y the p u p i l a r e a   . 
       rose o r i g i n a l l y conceived the i d e a l d e t e c t o r as d e t e c t i n g a f a i n t p a t t e r n superimposed on a u n i f o r m l y i l l u m i n a t e d background. the basis of rose's theory i s t h a t   i f a n i d e a l d e t e c t o r i s c o n t i n u a l l y t a k i n g samples of a mean number  n  of events from a d i s p l a y of i n d i v i d u a l   equal energy  e v e n t s   then an incremental increase an in the number of events in a sample w i l l be r e q u i r e d f o r the presence of the increment to be detected w i t h a predetermined c e r t a i n t y ; the magnitude of the increment being given by the e q u a t i o n : -

the i d e a l d e t e c t o r and the v i s u a l system 
       rose's i d e a l d e t e c t o r took samples of the same shape and size as the p a t t e r n to be d e t e c t e d   the s e n s i t i v i t y of the detector being uniform over the whole of the area of the sample. d e t e c t i o n of a p a t t e r n against a background would i n v o l v e comp a r a t i v e measurements w i t h i n the p a t t e r n area and of the background alone  the d i f f e r e n c e g i v i n g the s i g n a l which the eye u t i l i s e s . this s i g n a l is thought of as being detected against the s t a t i s t i c a l photon noise in the background picked up by both d e t e c t o r s . this is the noise which unavoidably a r i s e s from the quantum nature of the d e t e c t i o n of l i g h t   and s h o u l d   of course  include the quantum noise i n the s i g n a l t o o   i f t h i s i s s i g n i f i c a n t i n comparison w i t h the background. 
       the v i s u a l system  on the other hand  appears to be constrained to use samples of l i g h t f a l l i n g w i t h i n c e r t a i n summation areas. this question has been discussed in some d e t a i l in two other papers1 it appears l i k e l y t h a t the eye takes samples e i t h e r w i t h i n an area of r a d i a l symmetry  the dimensions of which depend on the mean l i g h t l e v e l  a primary or area d e t e c t i o n     or w i t h i n an elongated area  or l i n e a r d e t e c t o r   . the eye also appears to be constrained to i n t e g r a t e over a p e r i o d of time determined by the mean luminance of the l o c a l background

w i t h i n two such summation areas s t r a t e g i c a l l y placed w i t h respect to the r e t i n a l image of the p a t t e r n to be d e t e c t e d . thus  the d i f f e r e n c e is a measure of the number of photons a v a i l a b l e to form the s i g n a l an by which the presence of the p a t t e r n may be d e t e c t e d . s i m i l a r l y the sum is a measure of the t o t a l number  n + an of photons in the background and s i g n a l detected w i t h i n these summation areas.

of line or edge detection* ' 
　　　it is as though the two forms of detection work in p a r a l l e l   their output summing as in an 'or 1 gate. whichever is the more sensitive automatically takes over the task of detection; thus  the curves of figure 1 are compound curves. the contrast required for detection by each process has been calculated  and the minimum of the two plotted. 
it is interesting that this theory allows us 
to assume both k and s 	relatively constant over 
	. 	. 	o 
a wide range of light 	levels. 
using the values:-

　　　the work which has just been summarised is based on the concept of a detection process limited by quantum noise. the j u s t i f i c a t i o n for this concept is the relatively close agreement between the theoretical predictions based on i t   and the empirical data on visual thresholds. it would  however  be of interest to have independent evidence of the influence of noise on the detection process  and for this reason experiments were planned in which dynamic noise was deliberately added to the patterns presented to the eye. modification to the theory to take this additional noise into account w i l l be described  and the predictions of this theory w i l l be compared with observation of the visual threshold for noisy patterns of a number of observers. 
　　　the form of noise chosen for these experiments was quantum noise of the type one might expect in the output from an image intensifier. this noise arises owing to the detection of individual photons at i t s input photo-cathode. this form of noise has the advantage that it is essentially the same in nature as the quantum noise we have assumed to limit detection in the eye  though the size of the  quantum  presented to the retina is different. there is the added convenience that calculation is straightforward  albeit somewhat laborious for certain patterns. 
an extension of the detection theory 
　　　the f a l l off in sensitivity towards the edges of the summation area can be regarded either 
 i  as a lowering of the probability that the arrival of a photon would be recorded by the summing unit  or 
  i i   as a diminution of the effect of each photon at the summing unit. 
the distinction has hitherto been relatively unimportant because it only makes a difference to a single multiplying constant common to a l l the predictions. by integrating as in equation  1   and using the results in equations  1  and  1  to represent mean square noise  it has i m p l i c i t l y been assumed that the former assumption is j u s t i f i e d . the latter assumption could have led to a reduction in calculated mean square noise of up to ten times. thus in making comparisons between predictions and theory in order to estimate the numerical value o f t h e value o f this ratio 
i 
could be as high as 1 or 1. from now on  to emphasize the importance of this difference  the effective area over which the background is integrated to determine the mean square noise w i l l be denoted as ab instead of a  if we adopt assumption   i     then 1 ＊ 1  but it w i l l be shown that g can be lower than this according to assumption   i i   . 
　　　we now wish to consider the integrated effect within a summation area of a display made up of a large number of spots of l i g h t . we shall assume that the effect of a spot of light w i l l decrease as i t s distance from the centre of the area increases  according to the law previously assumed for in equation  1 . 
　　　the noise due to photon detection in the retina remains a function of mean retinal illumination as before. 	the noise due to the presence of individual spots may be calculated as follows. 
the effect of visual noise on the summation area 
　　　if we consider the receptive field to be stimulated by a random display of n spots of light or  dots  per square centimetre per second  then the mean number of spots of light f a l l i n g on an annulus of width 1r and radius r in time t i s : -

where v is the distance of the observer from the display in centimetres and r and or are angular distances subtended at the centre of the lens. the mean square variation in this number is also 

now  the mean number of photons detected from each dot w i l l be:-





sufficient for one to detect the requisite 
　　we need now to identify the events which must exceed a certain mean number for the pattern to 
　　　　　　　　the answer to this is simple. if there are plenty of light quanta per dot  but few dots available to denote the presence of the pattern  it is the number of dots which is important. i f   on the other hand  there are plenty of dots  but very few quanta per dot  it is the number of quanta which control the v i s i b i l i t y of the pattern. now  which of these two situations arises w i l l depend on the light level. 
                       -1 the sample size a t is proportional to i 
　　　this means that if the ambient light level is decreased by a factor of 1  the sample size 

　　　from the general equation  1   have been calculated curves of contrast versus light level for various sizes of disc stimuli  see figure 1 . the effective area of the stimulus a   has also been calculated for rectangles by numerical integration  and figure 1 shows the contrast versus light level curves for four sizes of rectangle  their areas being the same as for the discs in figure 1. 
　　　it was assumed  in calculating the curves of figures 1 and 1  that the light level was varied by changing q and keeping n constant. this is the way in which the output display of an image intensifier would vary if the photon gain was varied  with a fixed illumination on the photo cathode. it is also the way in which the simulated image intensifier display altered as the subject controlled the brightness of the display in empirical experiments. 
　　　it w i l l be noted that the stimuli  instead of gradually becoming more detectable as the light level is increased in this way  should be optimally visible at a particular light level  and thereafter become less v i s i b l e . 
a simplified explanation of the theory 
　　　mathematical equations are not always the best medium for imparting theoretical concepts  and so it is f e l t that a brief summary of the above theory would be advantageous. 
the basis of the theory is rose's equation:-

present in a sample. this indicates the need for the mean number of observed events n to be 
taken by the eye increases by a factor of 1. now the significant number of events in a sample can be either the number of quanta or the number of dots  whichever is the smaller. thus  at high light levels  high values of q   we have a small summation area containing a small number of dots but a large number of quanta per dot  as shown in the diagram at the bottom right hand corner of figure 1. under these circumstances the 
number of events  or dots  decreases as the light level is increased  because both the summation area a  and the summation time t  decrease. the pattern therefore becomes less visible with more l i g h t . 
　　　at threshold at low light levels  low values of q  there are few quanta per dot  although the size of the summation area has increased and w i l l probably encompass more dots  as shown on the left hand side of figure 1  it is now the number of quanta that control v i s i b i l i t y and thus v i s i b i l i t y improves with increasing light level  the relatively low rate of change of summation area and time being more than balanced by the change in light quanta available. 
　　　the final result is that v i s i b i l i t y is optimum at one light level and drops with either an increase or decrease in light level. thus  we have a dip in the curve of log contrast vs log light level as indicated in figure 1  and shown in more detail in figures 1 and 1. the relative steepmess of curve to be expected on either side of the minimum depends  of course  not only on the rapidity of change of t and rm  but also on the size of the pattern relative to the summation area. if the pattern is smaller than the summation area  then variation of summation area with light level w i l l have l i t t l e effect on an and the rising slope to the right of the minimum w i l l be 
much less steep. 
a special case 
　　　when the pattern is large compared with the summation area  i . e . r    r   equation  1  simplifies t o : -


　　　as q is varied  the value of c defined by this equation has a minimum when the terms within the root sign have a minimum. the minimum of 


but  if x ＊ 1 and z = 1 . 1   as we have postulated  then:-
		 1  
for a minimum. 
　　　if the minimum of such a curve is established  we can determine a value of s  and thus s  for either assumption regarding 1. this gives s1 independently from k and hence separates the terms in the lumped constant   referred to earlier. 
a preliminary empirical investigation of the detectability of patterns immersed in noise 
　　　when the existence of a predicted optimum light level for v i s i b i l i t y was encountered  experiments were designed to explore the region of the minimum required contrast* noisy images of various degrees of contrast were recorded on cine f i l m   so they could be presented to observers. they were told that there might be an optimum light level and were instructed to determine the lower threshold of v i s i b i l i t y and also a higher threshold  if one should be apparent. if no optimum could be found  or no pattern could be seen  they were asked to report accordingly. if they thought they could see a stimulus at a particular light level  and not above or below this light level  they were instructed to set the display to this light level and inform the experimenter that they had found an optimum. 
results 
　　　the thresholds set by two subjects are given in table i. qualitatively  the results confirm the existence of an optimum light level. the higher threshold has been determined in most cases where the theoretical predictions led to the expectation of a minimum in the curve of contrast vs light level within the range of light levels covered. 
analysis of the results 
　　　the anlysis of the results may be performed by comparing empirical upper and lower thresholds with theoretical predictions. 	figure 1 shows theoretical predictions based on the measured 
number n  of dots per unit area in the f i l m . the position of the curves to the l e f t of the minimum depends principally on the ratio  which has been taken as 1 in accordance with the mean measured over previous experiments for observer j.e. the position of the curves on the right hand side depends principally on k. thus  for k/1/sq fixed  there are several curves for 
different values of k. 
　　　the measured contrast of the film is indicated by the dotted line. now i f   for example  we assume that k ＊ 1  the predicted upper and lower thresholds would be expected where the curve for this value of k cuts the dotted l i n e . these points are indicated by crosses. in fact  the measured upper and lower thresholds for j.e. are as shown on the horizontal axis. these do not coincide precisely with the predicted values  and by working back one can deduce modified values of k and s   which correspond to the empirical measurements of threshold. for covenience  in comparing the empirical results a l l the measured thresholds have been converted in this way to equivalent 'empirical' values of k and s/b. these are shown in table i l a . 
　　　roughly speaking  it is the position of the minimum on the horizontal axis that determines s   as indicated by equation  1 . this relationship is exact for large discs  but the interdependence is more complex for smaller discs and other shapes. as k is varied  for a given s   there is a proportionate vertical displacement of the predicted curve. thus the horizontal separation of the points of intersection with the dotted 'contrast' line depends on k and s   roughly speaking  it is the horizontal separation of the two measured thresholds that determines the 'empirical' values of k. the relationship is again only simple for large discs and can involve appreciable computation for small discs and other patterns  especially when the slope differs either side of the minimum. 
　　　it w i l l be evident that if measurements are made in a region where the theoretical curves 
shown in figure 1 have a small gradient  the observer might be expected to have some d i f f i c u l t y in determining the threshold accurately. the repeatability of threshold measurements was within about 1 log units  rather poorer than most of the measurements made without noise present. this 
might be expected to lead to errors in s 1 /1  of perhaps 1 log units in magnitude. 	large errors 
might be expected where the observer has attempted to determine the light level for optimum v i s i b i l i t y . this must be borne in mind in looking at the 

-1-

values derived in table l l b   a l l of which were derived from a single measurement of optimum 
light level. 
conclusions 
　　　the mean value of k in table lla for observer j.e. is 1  with a mean square deviation of 1. for observer j.b. the mean is 1  with a mean square deviation of 1. these results suggest a significant difference between these two observers  and imply that it is necessary to treat observers as individuals in determining this parameter. 
　　　the mean value of sq/1 for j.e. is 1  with a mean square deviation of 1  and for j.b. is 1  with a mean square deviation of 1. the percentage variation here is much larger  but again there is a hint that the differences may be significant and that observers should be treated as individuals. 
　　　the interesting feature of these results is that when we consider the quotient 
measurement. the tentative conclusions clearly j u s t i f y continuation of further empirical work  to confirm the findings and to investigate factors such as the variation of k and s1 between individuals. when computing the results of a more comprehensive experiment  it would be desirable to introduce pupil area as a variable  and perhaps to employ a modified weighting function  s   to describe the variation of sensitivity across the summation area.1
