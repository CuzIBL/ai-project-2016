another  t h i s paper analyzes mental behavior in terms of the representation and use of knowledge. we describe a network memory to represent knowledge  give an account of the mental processes  and present a program that simulates our behavior  f o r the p a r t i c u l a r problem. 
i n t r o d u c t i o n 
　　　a great part of our d a i l y a c t i v i t i e s seems to be routine and t r i v i a l s cleaning  cooking  shopping  e t c . are performed without demanding much of our i n t e l l i g e n c e . yet the mental processes  behavior  involved in these a c t i v i t i e s are f a r from being clear and  on the contrary to t h e i r seemingful t r i v i a l i t y   we r e a l i z e we are making numerous decisions even when we go shopping f o r m i l k i which market to go to: by what means to go: which roads to taket how much to buy: which section of the market to go to: where to pay: e t c . 
       this paper presents an analysis of the mental processes in such a c t i v i t i e s . in p a r t i c u l a r   we choose an a c t i v i t y of going from one place to another  make our analysis in terms of the representation and use of knowledge  and subsequently describe a program to simulate the behavior. 
representation of knowledge 
       there are many studies that suggest the kinds of knowledge we possess  what the elements of knowledge are  how knowledge is organized  and how it may be u t i l i z e d t o perform c e r t a i n tasks   c f . 1   1  1  1  1 . an increasing amount of r e search concerns various aspects of our knowledge to a t t a i n systems f o r b e t t e r understanding of n a t u r a l language  to design v e r s a t i l e world models  or to create a robot t h a t reacts to i t s environment comprehensively   c f   1  1  1  1  1  1 . 
       what we know about geography  or a map l i k e t h a t in figure 1  may be expressed in english sentences asi 
euclid avenue meets east 1k s t r e e t . 
public l i b r a r y is west of alpha univ. 
c i t y h a l l 	is on lakeside avenue at east 1 s t r e e t . 
bus terminal is on chester avenue between east 1 street and east 1 s t r e e t . 
　　　when we consider these sentences as the external representation of our knowledge on geography  one way to i n t e r n a l i z e it is to analyze each sentence w i t h a functor   r e l a t i o n   and i t s argument  concepts   1  1 . the knowledge about the map in an a p p l i c a t i o n of t h i s theory may be considered as names of s t r e e t s and places  concepts  and r e l a t i o n s among them. the r e l a t i o n s e s s e n t i a l to the knowledge seem to be that of i n t e r sections! d i r e c t i o n s   e t c . 
　　　the i n t e r n a l i z e d knowledge may then have 	forms: 

where x  or y  is a street name  p is a place name  d is a direction  e.g. east   n is either a street name or a place name  and x # y  n  # n1. when the internalization is performed in this manner  its output is a network memory that is used to perform various tasks. the output from the use of knowledge in turn is behavior which may be physical  verbal  or mental. the example in figure 1 shows a 
part of figure 1 in a network form  where angular brackets stand for a street name  brackets for a place  and an ellipse for a relation. the totality of such a network constitutes what we know about geography. 
use of knowledge 
　　　it is possible to reach a certain place b from a by tracing a l l paths  when a and b are directly or indirectly related in the network. this way of going from one place to another  however  is costly and we human beings seem to have better ways to achieve the objective. for instance  when we know b is north of a  we may use such information  i.e.  direction  effectively to reach b. if we know how to reach a certain place c and b is located somewhere near c  we would probably go to c f i r s t and then try to reach b from c. 
　　　we do not necessarily take the shortest path between the two places. if some routes are well known to us  they may be used as norms to reach other places. these routes may be the ones for schools  shopping centers  offices  or the like.

       to analyze the behavior in the above  we suppose that the knowledge of direction d plays the central role to go from one place to another and that the primary directions d' are east  e   west  w   south  s   and north  n . others ne  nw  se  and sw are secondary ones. when we go from a to b  the f i r s t thing we should know is what is the direction of b from a. the direction is a relation in the network and is found by asking a question whether there is a relation of category d with object a and value b. if the answer to this question is not null  we have found the direct relation between a and b. our task then is to find a way to go toward the direction until we reach b. 
　　　when the answer is null  we must figure out d of a and b. we suppose that b is in d' for a certain place. then the specific relation sd of b from a may be found if the following relations hold between xo and x n  

       as the most essential operation  the process of finding d of a from x  is done as follows: 
1. initialization - create empty lists s1 and s1 that hold place names. set t to be one of d'. put a to s1. 
1. a -topmost element of si with deletion: if this fails  i.e.  s1 is empty  goto 1. 
1. d -direct relation between a and x.i if this succeeds  output d and stop. 
1. bottom of s1 -places that are in t of a| if this succeeds  goto 1. 
1  	if s1 is empty  stop  no direction is found . 	otherwise  
s1 -s1 with deletion and goto 1. 
       to find sd of b from a  we determine dl of xi. from a and then d1 of b from x . if x.i=b  there is no problem. but when 
x . / b j we must invoke the above process for 
d1 between x. and b. this is time consuming. our program does not check the possibility of xi - b with d1  but only xi-  b with d1. we assume that we can t e l l relatively well what are in the d' from where we are  but not from there. 
　　　once the specific direction is found  we assume the knowledge of places in that direction becomes most important to reach b. this implies that we tend to go to our destination through the places which are well known to us. this part of inference is not very algorithmic but is 
roughly done as follows: 

　　　x as the set of places includes places that are located within 1o from a and the straight line that connects a and b. for instance  if b is sb of a  x includes the places in s  e  and se of a. y as the set of places includes places that are in the inverse directions of x from b. y in the example therefore includes places in n  w  and nw from b. when we find out x or y  we arrange its elements so that the places in the primary directions be put f i r s t in the l i s t that hold elements of x or y. this makes it easy to incorporate into our program an assumption that we tend to go straight if possible  or tend to make the least number of turns  to reach the destination. 
it is quite unusual to go to xi from 
a even when xi is s of a  if xi is sw of b. that is  nobody makes a detour  or goes to an unnecessary direction. the intersection z between x and y takes care of this part of our behavior. 
　　　when we try to go from a to x   we suppose that the streets where a and xi are located intersect directly. if this is not the case  we try to find the way 
by searching every path exhaustively! we often look for every road near a to reach c when we know c is somewhere near a. 
program 
　　　the program creates a memory f i r s t and then answers questions on geography. schematically it has the following two phases: 
1 


1 


　　　questions 1 to 1 no longer need explanationsi main st is simply not known in question 1. in question 1  the direction of east 1 st from west 1 st or lakeside ave is not found. so  we attempt to reach there directly by the exhaustive search as is shown in a tree: 

the search is w i d t h - f i r s t   or l e v e l by l e v e l   and no s t r e e t node occurs more than once in the search t r e e . once it appears  a l l possible routes are expanded from t h e r e . thus  e1 and w1 are not attached to the tree as daughters of prospect ave. 
a f t e r f i n d i n g the d i r e c t i o n of abc 
m a l l from alpha u n i v e r s i t y   public l i b r a r y is found to be the place we go by in question 1  public l i b r a r y in t u r n is 
reached by going by bus terminal. but in doing: so  a small checking r o u t i n e finds out t h a t east 1 s t   which is known in r e l a t i o n to bus terminal  i n t e r s e c t s d i r e c t l y to the one of streets  lakeside ave  on which abc m a l l is located. although the d i r e c t i o n s of lakeside ave f r o m chester ave and east 1 st from lakeside ave at east 1 st are not known e x p l i c i t l y   they are calculated by the d i r e c t i o n a l r e l a t i o n s among bus terminal  public l i b r a r y   and abc m a l l . question 1 is answered in the same manner. but the d i r e c t i o n a l r e l a t i o n s between east 1 st 
and carnegie ave and between carnegie ave and east 1 st are not understood in this case. 
discussions 
　　　the program is written in fortran for a local reason  though it has a 
number of deficiencies in representing knowledge  string and l i s t processing  and other salient features that are available in the recent a. i. languages  1 . 
　　　we have not discussed about the routes that may be used as norms to reach other places. this problem may be solved by organising the network hieratchically so that we have a high-level subnetwork whose elements consist of well-known streets and places. 
　　　information to be used for going from one place to another need not be restricted to the one we described. we may use knowledge on traffic conditions such as width of roads  traffic signals  lights  density  etc. differences of distance in routes may be another important piece of information. 
　　　if we put the exact mileages between any two places  we can use it to determine the shortest route. but to do so may not be consistent with our way of representing knowledge. even if it is  it would not help much to explain our behavior unless we assume that we take the shortest path  which is often not the case at a l l   to reach our destination. probably some sorts of nearness or farness is more adequate measure to be used to represent the concept of distance. but what sorts of information are satisfactory in a net-
work for a certain problem domain is yet an unsolved question.
