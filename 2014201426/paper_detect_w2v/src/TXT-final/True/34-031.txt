　　the paper 	deals 	with 	the adaptive approach to deoision 	making as applied to 	the problems 	of biological 	and medical 	cybernetics 	characterised by a p r i o r i 	uncertainty. 	a number 	of algorithms 	is suggested which  	being based on the an a l l s i s of aposteriory information  	y i e l d 	the most 	adequate 
decision rule to a specific problem. the learning is achieved by the stochastic approximation method and by means of the correction of the decision rule structure the methods discussed have been realized on a computer and used in a cybernetic 
medical centre. 
introduction 
　　　the basic 	d i f f i c u l t i e s 	of 	the a r t i f i c i a l intelligence simulation i n biological and medical applications are connected 	with 	problem of choosing of techniques 	and 	algorithms 	of decision making. these problems are characterised by a 	lack of apriory information which prevetns 	the use 	of 	the 	classical techniques 	of the theory 	of automatic 
decision making. a way out may be found in 	the application 	of 	the ideas 	of adaptive learning. 	let us consider the formal approach to the problem. 
　let  and  - two measurable space  	i . e . the 	observation space and the decision 	space  	respectiveli. 	on 
 a f i n i t e family of probability measures is given. based on a certain rule probability is b u i l t which is a measurable image from to  being fixed then is a probability 
measure on . i n case the family 
is f u l l y defined the construction of the decision rule is clear. when  however  the family has undefined parameters  the 
decision rule w i l l have the same degree of uncertainty  to be specified with the accoxnulation of observation data. 
 let the probability measure on 	is b u i l t by the procedure of the potential function 	method. as is well known 	 there are two realisation of 	potential function 	method  i . e . 	the perception and the computer 	ones. 	the perception realisation deals with a system of basic function 	 while 	the 
computer 	realisation deals 	with 	a potential function 	  which ie a 
symmetrical kernal on 	and 	is
