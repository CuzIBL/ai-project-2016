 data types  or objects  correspond to only a subset of the ways that concepts can combine in a programmer's mind. 
　　these limitations on the expressivity of programming languages have led ai/sw researchers to use more expressive languages for writing down the knowledge. these include a variety of program schema languages and the predicate calculus. a schema language  eg.  1   is usually a programming language of

some sort augmented with pattern-matching variables. plans are represented as incomplete programs  with variable parts. this approach lends itself well to syntactic matching on programs written in the base programming language  but the reasoning is subject to various types of errors  because the syntactic pattern matching can generate semantic nonsense. in particular  schema variables can be instantiated with code segments which destroy the dataflow relationships assumed by other parts of the schema.
