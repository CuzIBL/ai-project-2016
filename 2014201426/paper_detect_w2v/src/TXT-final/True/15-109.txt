	i 	introduction 
   in the area of expert-systems the acquisition of knowledge is known to be a problem - machine learning as a discipline is one result of that. an al-system which models a special part of the world has to be seen as a knowledge based system. its implementation presupposes the analysis of that domain  and in most cases  these domains are not as well-known as they should be. so we are dealing not just with a specific problem of expert systems but 
with a general ai problem. 
　if we divide knowledge into facts and rules  the process of discovering inference-rules is the more interesting one  because these inference-rules 
express the ways of thinking in a specific domain. 
　this paper presents a method for machine learning of inference rules which involves both 'learning by induction' and 'learning by being t o l d ' . concern the l a t t e r   it is assumed that the generalizations depend on the ordering of the facts told to the system  or to a human being   see section 1 . the former corresponds to higher concepts which are used to structure a new domain described by facts.

etc.   we introduce an additional theoretical concept: support-sets. using this term we are able to say:  colder-than is transitive on geographicalobjects  go's  . in a more formal way this can be described by 
 1  support set   t r a n s i t i v i t y  colder-than   go's  
with the interpretation  the rule schema of trans is to be applied only on go.  
　in this paper we concentrate on support sets; they are the basis for discovering concepts like the equator. 
　presupposing the existence of such concepts in the human mind we define the notion  characteristic situation for higher concepts   cs . we distinguish positive cs's  +cs   considering positive evidence  and negative cs's  -cs   considering negative evidence - counterexamples   1     . 
　these cs's correspond to the rule schemata and have to be regarded as empirical evidence for the existence  or nonexistence  of the transitivity of 
p. 	in case we find positive evidence of this sort  
i.e. of instantiations of +cs's of a higher relational concept  we may hypothesize this higher concept for the corresponding predicative concept  e.g. the t r a n s i t i v i t y of  colder-than . knowledge of this kind  i.e. of the type ' h - c   p - i   '   which is built up from predicate constants  p-i  and constants for higher concepts  h-c   constitutes metafacts.  similar concepts are used in omega .  acquisition of inferences through the use of higher concepts can be integrated in the system in the following way * : 
- searching in the knowledge base for cs's 
- analyzing the support set depending on the empirical data - hypothesizing rule schemata 
- working with the new rule schemata.

　the additional metafacts generalized on the basis of the previous knowledge and the facts of step 1 are listed together with the sources in the next table  fig. 1 . the parallelism of 'nor' and 'war' 
and of 'sou' and ' c o l ' as well as the conversity between 'nor' and 'war' and between 'sou' and ' c o l ' are induced by the new facts. the transitivity hypotheses of ' c o l ' and 'war' is inferred by 
metarules  cp. fig. 1 . 
　by the use of the inference rules produced out of the rule schemata with the help of the metafacts  
additional data can be inferred. 
iv analyses and restructuring of support sets 
　at this stage  a l l the knowledge is consistent  because we offered only-a special subset: instances of meteorological relations from the northern hemisphere. up to now this distinction is unknown to the system  so for the countries from the southern hemisphere it s t i l l infers that the climate is warmer in the south. now the system is given a f i r s t set of counterexamples  1.a : 
	col  c  h arg  	war  bol arg  
and a second set of counterexamples  1.b : 
	war  par c  h  	col  arg par  	col  par bol  
fig. 1: the 	instructional 	data 	- 	step 	1: 
counterexamples 
　these new instructions violate the parallelism between 'nor' and ' c o l ' or 'sou' and 'war'   respectively  i.e. they are inconsistent with mf1 to mf1  but consistent with mf1 and mf1. thus the support sets of these metafacts  up to now the 
whole set go  have to 	be changed. in the beginning the 	counterexamples 	are 	treated 	simply 	as exceptions and 	thus the support set 	strategy sssl  cp. fig. 1  is used *. 
sssl: if there are exceptions   not empty ex-set  then reduce the support set: 
sup-set mf.i new  - sup-set mf.i old    
                                 ex-set mf.i new  sss1: if the ex-set is large  or relevant  then try to find regularities in ex-set. if possible  
reanalyse the support set  probably with respect to other or new mf.j's: 
sup-set mf.i old  - join sup-set mf.i.new   
sup-set.1 mf.j new   
ex-set mf.i new   
fig. 1: strategies for restructuring the support set 
* 'ex-set   mf1  1.a  ' means 'the exception-set of the metafact mf1 after instruction step 1.a'. the other formulas have to be interpreted analogously. in the following we discuss only mf1  as example ; via conversity and some of the other mf's the counterexamples and thus mf1 and mf1 are treated in the same way.

	v 	conclusions and related work 
   in the present paper we describe a method of l e a r n i n g inference r u l e s by means of higher concepts of knowledge. the example used is an i d e a l i z a t i o n w i t h respect to the dichotomie  or rather spectrum  'exact r u l e s ' - ' r u l e s of thumb'. we w i l l deal w i t h the l a t t e r case by using a concept of ' i n e x a c t r e a s o n i n g ' ; thus the basic ideas described in t h i s paper as 'higher c o n c e p t s '   ' s u p p o r t s e t s ' and t h e i r analysis and r e s t r u c t e r i n g w i l l b e useful i n t h i s case  t o o . 
   kindred l e a r n i n g concepts which influenced our work are l e a r n i n g by analogy   1     learning by c l u s t e r i n g methods  and automatic theory formation   1   . 
　we w i l l conclude w i t h two short remarks: f i r s t   the l e a r n i n g concepts described here have been 
given a f i r s t implementation in prolog by the kitgroup at the technical u n i v e r s i t y of b e r l i n . secondly  the system w i l l be applied in a t e x t understanding system   w i t h knowledge about s p a t i a l and temporal r e l a t i o n s   . 
* a clever system should do t h a t   and we hope that our system is a clever one. but in the current s t a t e of implementation the system does not react in the s o p h i s t i c a t e d manner described above. it is o n l y able to recognize that  something happens.  
　** as a d i f f e r e n c e to lenats' am  which is able to discover i n t e r e s t i n g mathematical concepts our system is more g o a l - o r i e n t e d   is looking for concepts in order to resolve c o n t r a d i c t i o n s .
