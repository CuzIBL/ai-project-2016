s discrepancy in a group of cooccurring discrepancies indicates where exactly among the discrepancies the misconception lies. dealing with this root discrepancy can lead to the eradication of an entire set of bugs. 
¡¡the second step involves investigating mechanisms for articulating the causal relationships determined in the first step. specifically this will involve analytical justification of the mainly empirically determined causal relationships and will entail deeper knowledge about the components of a program and their specific role or behavior. the third step involves developing a case-based reasoner that uses the output and byproducts of the algorithms in the previous steps to determine the most appropriate remedial feedback to give a student in order to address his or her misconception.

conceptual clustering is the grouping of unlabeled objects into categories for which conceptual descriptions  concepts  are formed  and is the primary method for concept formation  i.e.  unsupervised concept learning  in artificial intelligence. most if not all conceptual clusterers form concepts solely on the basis of regularities in the data; however  causal relationships are important to strengthen concept coherence. for this reason  we have developed an algorithm for unsupervised concept formation  called mmd  sison  numao and shimura  1   that integrates similarity measures and causality heuristics. preliminary results show that mmd is capable not only of classifying  prolog  program bugs correctly  but also of identifying causal relationships among these bugs.
