discussion 
　　　　learning .in complex domains entails a large combinatorial search. the research described here attempts to solve two problems: generally  where to look in a domain for knowledge that w i l l help reduce the search space. s p e c i f i c a l l y   how to automatically generate word dictionaries for speech understanding systems both e f f i c i e n t l y and accurately. at the time of w r i t i n g the approach taken here appears to be f r u i t f u l . one idea that we see occurring repeatedly in this and other work   e . g . . vision  is the importance of models at various levels of abstraction in both the pruning and v e r i f i c a t i o n ot learned representations.
