       the t a c t i l e i n f o r m a t i o n plays an important r o l e f o r an i n t e l l i g e n t robot a c t i v i t y . the main advantage of the t a c t i l e i n f o r m a t i o n over the o p t i c a l one l i e s in i t s 1-d character. the t a c t i l e i n f o r m a t i o n can be used both f o r a f i n e r p o s i t i o n i n g before g r i p p i n g the object and f o r the shape and dimension r e c o g n i t i o n by a simultaneous handling the o b j e c t . 
       l e t ' s solve the l a t t e r problem. 1-d objects are gripped by an antropomorphic f i v e - f i n g e r hand. the hand c o n s i s t s of a palm to which the o b j e c t is pressed by m u l t i j o i n t e d f i n g e r s . the a r t i f i c i a l hand model has been designed by chalupa and marik   under the goalem p r o j e c t   1   . the complex t a c t i l e i n f o r m a t i o n i s obtained both from the t a c t i l e  contact  sensing elements s i t u a t e d on the palm surface and from the p o s i t i o n sensing element set  pses  on the f i n g e r j o i n t s . the r e g u l a r r e c t a n g u l a r net of the o n - o f f t a c t i l e elements is c a l l e d a t a c t i l e sensing u n i t  tsu . the tsu matrix consists of 1 l i n e s per 1 elements in one l i n e and 1 l i n e s per 1 elements the distance between the centers of neighbouring ones being 1 mm and the r a d i u s of the elements being 1 mm. for d e t a i l s see  
1 shape recognition by means of tsu 
¡¡¡¡¡¡1  the string a is transformed to the string b by a d i g i t a l f i l t e r : for simplicity we have considered the distance between two adjacent boundary points being h  even if it is  .h for the directions 1¡ã + k.1¡ã . in principle the response of the f i l t e r is expressed as a convolution b = f *a modulo 1 where f is the impulse response* having done a lot of experiments we have arrived at conclusions that for the string lengths n = 1 the transfer function 

is suitable for the shape recognition* our experience is in concordance with the theoretical conclusions of  . 
¡¡¡¡¡¡1  each number in the string b is considered as a primitive of the structural  linguistic  description. to each primitive the terminal symbol  is assigned. each tsu 
pattern is described by a sentence c = c   . .   c   
¡¡¡¡¡¡1  for the syntactical analysis of c tree grammars g1 and g are employed. g1 and g1 are the grammars for angular and oval patterns respectively. the shape of the pattern  angular or oval  is roughly determined by the grammar by means of which the parsing is successfully accomplished. the grammars g1' and g1 have been derived from the descriptions of the typical patterns. 
¡¡¡¡¡¡1  at the semantical analysis stage the right interpretation of the chain a is looked for. for example corner positions  edge lengths and the angle of edges are computed for the angular patterns  centers and symetry axis lengths are evaluated for oval ones. then we 
refine the shape classification inside the basic two classes  rectangle  square  triangle  . . . .   circular line  e l l i p s e   . . .   . the semantical analysis can be expressed in terms of a special grammar for semantical analysis gsa   1   .
