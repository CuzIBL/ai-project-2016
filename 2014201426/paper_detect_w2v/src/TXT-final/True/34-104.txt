i . introduction 
   a substantial amount of r e s e a r c h has been done in developing techniques for locating objects of interest a u t o m a t i c a l l y in d i g i t i z e d p i c t u r e s . d r a w i n g the boundaries around objects is essent i a l for pattern r e c o g n i t i o n   t r a c i n g of objects in sequence of pictures for c o n t r o l systems  image enhancement  data reduction  and various other applications. references 1  z  and 1 c o m p r i s e a good s u r v e y of r e s e a r c h and applications in image processing and p i c t u r e analysis. 
　　most researchers of p i c t u r e analysis assumed that  1  the image of an object is m o r e or less u n i f o r m or smooth in its l o c a l properties  that i s . i l l u m i n a t i o n   c o l o r   and l o c a l texture are s m o o t h l y changing inside the image of an object  and  1  there is detectable d i s c o n t i n u i t y in l o c a l p r o p e r t i e s between images of two different objects. we w i l l adopt these two assumptions in 
this paper and assume no t e x t u r a l image  see ref. 1 for an example of texture image analysis w h i c h does not make these assumptions . 
   the w o r k on automatic location of objects in d i g i t i z e d images has split into two approaches: 
 1  edge detection and edge f o l l o w i n g vs  1  region g r o w i n g . edge detection meant applying in different points over the p i c t u r e l o c a l independent operators to detect edges and then using algor i t h m s to trace the boundaries by f o l l o w i n g the l o c a l edge detected. a recent survey of l i t e r a t u r e in this area is given in ref. s. the r e g i o n g r o w i n g approach was to use various c l u s t e r i n g a l g o r i t h m s to g r o w regions of a l m o s t u n i f o r m l o c a l properties in the image.  see refs. 1 for t y p i c a l applications.   m o r e detailed references w i l l be given later. 
　　in this paper the two approaches are combined to c o m p l e m e n t each other. the end r e s u l t is a m o r e p o w e r f u l m e c h a n i s m to do the job of segm e n t a t i o n pictures into objects. we developed a 
　　new edge detector and combined it w i t h new r e gion g r o w i n g techniques to locate objects and thereby resolved the confusion that has resulted for r e g u l a r edge f o l l o w i n g when m o r e than one isolated object on a x m i f o r m background is in the scene  see ref. 1 . 
   the contributions of this report are the following: 
    1  a new and  optimal   given certain assumptions  edge detector is presented. 
    1  a simple one-pass region growing algorithm which was implemented on a mini-computer. it utilizes the edge detector output. 
    1  the application of path generator algorithms and  shortest path algorithms  to do the boundary following so as to close open edge lines into boundaries around regions. 
    1  special-purpose region growing intended to close open edges  cracks . 
    1  a special clustering algorithm which s i m plifies the region structure resulting from application of  1  through  1 . 

   an edge-line  or an edge  between region r1 and region r1 is the maximal sequence of adjacent edge units such that each edge unit in the sequence is between two matrix points  one belonging to r1 and the other to r1. it is possible that an edge line is inside a region  r1 = r1 . 
1    an edge line which is between two different regions is called a boundary. an edge line which is inside a region is called a crack. an open crack is a crack in which at least one end t e r m i nates without connecting to any edge line. a 
closed crack is one w h i c h t e r m i n a t e s at both ends on another edge line. f o r instance  c r a c k s w i l l appear when an object is s m o o t h l y d i s a p p e a r i n g into the background on one side and has detecable d i s c o n t i n u i t y on the other side   f i g . 1 . 
　　using the above definitions  this r e p o r t p r e sents an edge detector w h i c h detects edge units in p a r a l l e l l o c a l l y on the whole image. t h e n a r e gion g r o w e r w h i c h results in the g r o u p i n g of m a t r i x points into regions and edge units into boundaries and cracks is presented. a l o c a l r e gion g r o w e r w h i c h t r i e s to break a r e g i o n w i t h a crack in it into two regions for w h i c h the c r a c k is part of the c o m m o n boundary is then presented. a l t e r n a t i v e l y   a n o p e n - c r a c k - e x t e n d i n g a l g o r i t h m is suggested to connect the open edge unit of the crack to another edge l i n e . 
h i . 	the l o c a l edge detector 
   the edge operator is a detector of l o c a l d i s c o n t i n u i t y in an image. when applied between two adjacent points such as   i   j   and  i i l   j     it should r e t u r n a value which w i l l m e a s u r e the confidence 
that there is an edge between   i   j  and  i + l   j   . since we w o r k w i t h noisy input to achieve r e l i a b i l i t y   the operator must look at two 1-dimens ional  1-d  neighborhoods n  and n1 to obtain a r e l i a b l e value. neighborhood nj w i l l include   i   j   and a few adjacent points; n1 includes  i + 1  j  and a few adjacent points; and nj  ~  n% 1. as a r e s u l t the value r e t u r n e d w i l l m e a s u r e the confidence that the neighborhoods belong to images of d i f f e r ent objects. 
　　kdge detection is actually composed of three components:  !  choosing the p r o p e r neighborhoods   1  the measurements of differences between image s t r u c t u r e s in the two neighborhoods  and   i  l o c k i n g on the exact position of the edge. discussion of each of these steps f o l l o w s . 
i v . 	m e a s u r i n g differences i n s t r u c t u r e between two neighborhoods 
   a n y technique w h i c h m e a s u r e s t r u c t u r a l d i f ferences must make some assumption   e x p l i c i t l y or i m p l i c i t l y   on the s t r u c t u r e of an edge vs the area inside a r e g i o n . l u n f o r d and h e r s h k o v i t z  ref. 1  suggested three possible ideal edges defined by the intensity p r o f i l e on a n o r m a l - t o the-e.dge line   f i g . 1 . 
   a l l of these idealized edges are in r e a l i t y washed w i t h gaussian noise on both sides  w h e r e the noise is the result of both h a r d w a r e noise and surface i r r e g u l a r i t i e s . b a s i c a l l y   the decision needed to be made is between two hypotheses: 
ho- the readings in nj and n1 are taken f r o m the same object. 
   : 	the readings in nl are taken f r o m one object and in n1 f r o m another object. 
neighborhoods n1 and n1 are the neighborhoods mentioned in the previous section  and the decision  vs to how to choose them w i l l be d e s c r i b e d in the next section.

	v. 	l o c k i n g on a detected edge 
   c o m p u t i n g the edge value is not usually sufficient to decide w h e r e to put the edges. the values that are computed u s u a l l y look l i k e the ones in f i g . 1. 
   one w a y of f o r c i n g the edge to be w e l l defined is to c o n s t r a i n it to be a l o c a l m a x i m u m in a d d i t i o n to having a confidence value higher than a c e r t a i n t h r e s h o l d . t h i s i s   of c o u r s e   e x t r e m e l y i m p o r t a n t for l o c k i n g on the center of the edge  see ref. 1  page 1 . usually there is s t i l l some l o c a l a m b i g u i t y on the location of the edge  and f o r m a n y p r a c t i c a l reasons it is better to treat the area around an edge as ambiguous the source of p r o b l e m s here is that  because of c o m puting t i m e c o n s t r a i n t s   it was i m p o s s i b l e to f i n d a global o p t i m u m for edge lines using a l l a v a i l able data  and it was necessary to use only l o c a l i n f o r m a t i o n f o r evaluating the edge units in this l e v e l . in our s y s t e m   the d e c i s i o n as to w h e r e exactly to put the edge was left for the r e g i o n g r o w e r  see below . to demonstrate the possible 1 - d a m b i g u i t y   see f i g . 1. 
the search for a m a x i m u m m a y be used f o r special-purpose edge detection. 	f o r instance  	i f 
we look only for one d a r k s t r i p e c r o s s i n g a w h i t e background  	f o r c i n g the edge to be the absolute m a x i m u m or m i n i m u m on a h o r i z o n t a l l i n e in the image  keeping t r a c k of the d i r e c t i o n of the change  w i l l supply the a p p r o p r i a t e p a i r of edges.

　　the output of an a p p l i c a t i o n of an edge detect o r results in two new m a t r i c e s in addition to the m a t r i x v   i   j   o f r a w data. the f i r s t i s e v   i   j     w h i c h is the m e a s u r e of the confidence that there is an edge unit between   i   j  and   i   j + 1 ; the second is e h   i     j     w h i c h m e a s u r e s the confidence that there is an edge unit between   i   j   and   i + l   j   . e v   i   j   and e h { i   j   m a y include extra bits as d e t e r m i n e d by the d i r e c t i o n of the change on that suggested edge unit. 
　　t h i s output as it stands is not sufficient for a p p l i c a t i o n of p a t t e r n r e c o g n i t i o n and v a r i o u s p i c ture quantitative analysis tasks. outlines of objects are needed in o r d e r to recognize features. one w a y of achieving that is to use a r e g i o n g r o w e r w h i c h w i l l outline objects b y c l u s t e r i n g points into regions. t h i s approach was used in the past f o r p i c t u r e a n a l y s i s . recent w o r k s along that line are refs. 1  1  1  and 1- the basic c o n c l u s i o n of those w o r k s is that without using semantic i n f o r m a t i o n   w h i c h is the k n o w l edge on the subject of the p i c t u r e   c l u s t e r i n g cannot create perfect o u t l i n e s . m o r e recent w o r k   ref. 1 and 1   pg. 1  i n t r o d u c e d new t e c h ' niques o f c l u s t e r i n g w h i c h p r o v i d e m o r e f l e x i b i l i t y and m a y upgrade c l u s t e r i n g p e r f o r m a n c e f o r images . 
　　h e r e we introduce a new a l g o r i t h m for c l u s t e r i n g based on search f o r   v a l l e y s   of edge values in a p i c t u r e if r a n d o m access is a l l o w e d   a r e l a t i v e l y s i m p l e a l g o r i t h m w h i c h starts f r o m l o c a l m i n i m a of edge values and c l i m b up can be i m p l e m e n t e d . due to lack of storage capacity on our m i n i - c o m p u t e r   and in an a t t e m p t to use data as it d i g i t i z e d f r o m the video s i g n a l sequentially  a one-pass a l g o r i t h m to generate regions c o r r e s ponding to valleys was i m p l e m e n t e d . to our knowledge  this is the f i r s t t i m e that this app r o a c h is used. m o s t w o r k s on r e g i o n g r o w i n g  ours included  l a c k the capacity to m a k e use of the shape of the g r o w i n g object. an a l t e r n a t i v e approach to r e g i o n g r o w i n g is  edge f o l l o w i n g   w h i c h was used in v a r i o u s w o r k s l i k e refs. 1  1  1  and 1 . the basic idea in edge f o l l o w i n g 
　　is to detect a d i s c o n t i n u i t y and trace it and this 
w a y define edge l i n e s . unfortunately  the w o r k s in edge f o l l o w i n g suffers f r o m l a c k of an effective 
w a y of t y i n g regions p r o p e r t i e s into t h e i r decision processes and output. 
   l e t us s t a r t by d e s c r i b i n g a one-pass algor i t h m w h i c h the edge data into data s t r u c t u r e s of regions  	boundaries  	closed c r a c k s and open 
c r a c k s   and creates  as b y p r o d u c t s   two a r r a y s   f h   i   j   and f v   i   j     w h e r e f h   i   j   means that the p r o g r a m puts an edge unit between  i - 1  j  and   i   j     and f v   i   j   means a n edge unit between   i   j   and   i   j - 1 . 
   to ease the d e s c r i p t i o n of the d e c i s i o n m e c h a n i s m f o r placing edges  we need to define a few new t e r m s . l e t t   1 be the edge confidence t h r e s h o l d ; then

   m e r g i n g of two regions may always result in transformation into a crack of a previously c o m mon boundary of the two regions. in general  each operation of the region grower is f a i r l y elaborate: m o r e than meets the eye. the data structure used is not described in this paper  but it is essentially the same data structure described in ref. 1  with slight modification to include edge line representation through chain encoding. 
   this one-pass a l g o r i t h m is local and requires relatively small core resident data. however  it does not create m a x i m a l regions w i t h respect to our c r i t e r i a of path connectivity and reachability. the reason is the possible directionality of the

to elaborate the task of the image analysis and is defined h e u r i s t i c a l l y . in fact  in the c u r r e n t i m p l e m e n t a t i o n a l l c r a c k s are deleted since the edge operator was sensitive enough for our purposes.

take the output data  which is s i m p l e r e l a t i v e to o r i g i n a l p i c t u r e   and s i m p l i f y i t . w e take p a i r s of regions w i t h c o m m o n boundaries and m e r g e

ferent in the c u r r e n t s t r u c t u r e   m e r g e t h e m   and update the s t r u c t u r e . the confidence is dependent on two f a c t o r s :  1  the magnitude of the change across the boundary and  1  the difference of the p r o p e r t i e s inside the two r e g i o n s . both of these values are computed on the basis of assumptions s i m i l a r to those used in the edge confidence evaluation. f o r instance  if we assume g r a y l e v e l readings  then l e t xj i = 1  n be the readings on one r e g i o n and x i ' i = 1  m be the readings at the other  then the second factor w i l l be:
