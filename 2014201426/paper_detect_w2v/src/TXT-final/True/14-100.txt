 setting in which the system operates  and from which it derives its name  is the following the system is intially given some first order language l  i here is some unknown model m f or l  and an oracle  user  that can supply facts and answer queries on the truth or falsity of ground atoms in m i he goal of the system is to find a finite set of true horn clauses  which imply all true ground atoms and no false ones 
     i he user inputs the predicate to be inferred and the terms  predicate symbols  function symbols and constants  to be used in the intended axiomatization ol this predicate after receiving the initial input  the system starts prompting the user for new facts at each stage  the system maintains a set of hypotheses that are sufficient to derive all true atoms and none of the false atoms supplied so far 
     when an inconsistency is discovered between the hypotheses and the tacts  the contradiction backtracing algorithm is invoked in order to resolve this contradiction  the algorithm may query lor the truth of atoms not supplied b  the user yet when the hypotheses fan not derive some atom known to be true  the system adds to the conjecture refinements of previously refuted hypotheses. 
     i he user sees the axiomatization as it is developed by the system when he thinks the system has converged to a correct and sufficient axiomatization of the predicate  he can terminate the inference process it is his responsibility to terminate the system  since it is an inherent property of an inductive inference algorithm that /f can never determine whet her it has converged 
     below are examples ol the performance ol the system furthcr examples can be found in  1  i he system runs compiled using the in-core compiler of the edinburgh prolog-1 version .v i he computer is a decsystcm-1. running prolog-1 under the compatibility package pa 1 in the following  the running time in cpu seconds measured the time the system took to converge to a correct and sufficient axiomatization of the intended model facts arc the number of facts read therein  and hypotheses generated is the number of hypotheses generated by the refinement operator during the inference. i he numbers lollowmg an axiom are its sequential number as it was generated  and the number of refinement operations needed to generate it
