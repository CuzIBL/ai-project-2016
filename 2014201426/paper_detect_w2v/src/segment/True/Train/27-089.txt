recovering message communication system laboratory take yokosuka investigated message usenet newsgroup analyzed natural corpus investigation proposes computational recovering message japanese main natural message efficiently recovered linguistic type know utilize network forum llammond thus electronic message inevitable realize intelligent access super highway motivation started work investigation message usenet newsgroup krol newsgroup corpus forum apple macintosh mainly message aimed message appeared threemonths term message writer type slightly simplified message corpus needle intention infected kind virus wanted vaccine make read formatted floppy disk apple file exchanger read maciis read formatted story trouble sentence type read message able guess vaccine trouble stated thanks marker able guess even good disinfecting virus hand seems unclear sentence possibility role vaccine followed read disk shoot trouble vaccine read disk main verb sentence slight clue seem domain help disambiguation process wrong belief even domain case clearly trial make read disk failed suggests disinfect virus macii note process message seen trouble stated prevent achieving goal explicit message introduces goal disinfecting virus goal actually underivable domain response message pointed hayashi tion stated seen step differs cascaded process process identifies message fragment describes step recognizing distinctive surface many extraction system hobbs kitani fragment represents step process process integrates represents graph help linguistic heuristic discourse graph

perfect tense many case represents nuance writer undesirable masuoka domain turn describing problematic verb negation form represents agent verb writer desirable empathy kuno domain negation form represents writer think caused problematic type open thus must explicit type expressed mainly list identified type triple connective antecedent consequent brief explanation distinctive japanese connective type case connective suggests sentence describes kind fact thus insists type undesirable caused connective establishes background connective intentional suggests hold time connective neutral corresponds english kakawarazu even even english masuoka connective emphasize expectation violation speaker type strongly type confirmed mapping rule gave fairly accurate toward corpus data hand simulation show mapping rule stress rate hayashi assigning process extracted fragment type newly introduced goal type goal encoded fixed type know goal execute simply type know precondition hold

intentionally kind link node caused link imagine case writer wondering work goal thus know request message type mentioned newly introduced goal know strongly request message outline process looked message chronological thus basically construct incrementally central part link subgraph constructed procedure crucial node node constructed type link answer procedure simply node part connection note

ambiguous relationship vaccine make read clearly captured also know infected unfixed case clearly work reported close plan worth mentioning view roughly speaking plan natural long studied perspective hearer speaker utterance recognizing speaker plan generates utterance assumed hearer speaker plan seems handle plan speaker invalid hearer thus actuality work addressed pollack pollack view plan mental attitude speaker invalid plan handled dialogue work reported partly inspired work wood comment voods pollack deal partially specified plan incomplete plan plan vaccine disinfect virus knowing vaccine case incomplete plan precondition failure plan handled problematic besides wood made comment essay role surface introducing want tenure rented unambiguously signal relationship necessity determining plan infer answer particularly conclusion work computational recovering message domain work trial remain worked computational viewpoint must unseen data hand viewpoint harder particularly main concern moment formalization term mental process pollack formalizes plan mental attitude acknowledgment like thank jerry hobbs valuable advice work tsuneaki kato comment work done mainly staying csli stanford thus thanks also csli
