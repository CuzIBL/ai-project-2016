satisfaction reformulated linear reformulated domain size time surprising link algebraic show satisfaction simply exponential determining also address minimizing interested arise combinatorics artificial intelligence satisfaction familiar task graphcoloring exhaustive alternative converting linear satisfaction show converted linear linear analyze time give applying show surprising address good linear derive simply exponential toroidal provably backtrack sense backtracking enumerating must take much time actually enumerating time converting linear turn linear assignment fact exactly assignment prohibit assignment hold pair assignment forbidden form clear assign linear corresponds corresponds containing assignment multiplying linear linear diophantine generating multiplying give linear diophantine linear diophantine unknown form unknown hand generating formal parameter need mathematics coefficient fact proved euler schrijver page linear linear moment form relax restriction shortly coefficient monomial identity giving simplify remember interested coefficient ignore term divisible term divisible free slight abuse refer free part generating next note latter term free discarded give binomial namely need find system coefficient obvious simply multiply look term iteratively multiply binomial throw away term free repeat next binomial relax form exactly diophantine rivin zabih implicitly defines equality hand side implicit equality glance seem system implicit system equality closer look generating show need implicit system replace equality hand side examine free part implicit system equality coefficient term implicitly asserts system replaced plus replaced simply replace calculate generating coefficient replaced also part namely coefficient thus need calculate generating system equality implicitly simply replace equality hand side calculate coefficient implicit system equality summarize replace equality calculate free part coefficient coefficient term justifies linear consisted entirely equality form time time multiply iteration iteration multiply binomial represents thus multiplied time proportional size need size naively many term degree potentially high remember discard term free algebraic terminology computation ring give term degree term summarizing iteratively computes binomial term take time time show reduce worst case worth noting expect find time determining arbitrary coefficient schrijver proved linear even coefficient restricted placing rook chessboard rook attack clear permutation particularly encoding linear assignment convert exactly rook column encodes fact exactly rook column exactly rook column exactly rook formal parameter generating corresponds applying binomial binomial chessboard binomial column coefficient ignores time scalar take noting size coefficient scalar done time mlog find good encoding surprisingly multiplying corresponds closely backtrack find binomial term picking term force pick

corresponds failure backtrack note fact assignment constitute lost identity binomial recorded show fact time applying time significantly correspondence coefficient searching binomial term believe multiply iteratively correspond obvious applying backtrack seem thus susceptible parallel like dixon kleer good encoding difficulty time exponential encode many encoding able find good clearly must

encoding size smallest covering clique assignment graph covering graph clique garey johnson optimal encoding take exponential time case like chessboard easy find optimal encoding settle encoding also phrase vertex assignment graph also reduce good encoding obvious characterization good encoding good answer floyd suggests relationship smallest floyd pointed corresponds rivin zabih complement assignment graph equivalently size assignment graph work combinatorics relationship fixed size graph size smallest vertex relationship characterization work well term relies multiplying modification enumeration counting also reduce time carefully arranging binomial comprising multiplied enumeration determining interested enumerating convert linear need slightly recall converting assignment slight namely enumeration determining coefficient multiply selecting term binomial keep track binomial side coefficient encode multiplied iteratively coefficient time john lamping used reduce time multiply identify subset binomial comprising never outside binomial effectively reduce computing binomial grouped term highest divide term divisible usual discard free term contained coefficient replace forget never remaining part reduces reduces time well exponential turn guaranteed pair enables reduce turn reduces time pair encoding representing fact must exactly correspond constrains exactly binomial exactly binomial correspond binomial form coefficient need calculate even take necessarily coefficient recall linear corresponds actually representing happens replace discard summing coefficient stand implicit system equality early computation waiting multiply calculating thus reduce binomial corresponds assignment ordering guaranteed reduce corresponds considering assignment fixed moving next multiplying binomial satisfaction confined placing piece chessboard encoding property corresponds unsatisfiability detected consistency mackworth classic gauss placing queen chessboard queen attack toroidal line attack queen torus toroidal strictly fewer regular trivial fact evidence toroidal regular exponential rivin vardi toroidal formulated also column diagonal bottom applying time regular time diagonal give time turn need seen noting moving next remove left eliminates antidiagonal eliminated diagonal eliminates diagonal antidiagonal give much preliminary promising conclusion surprising connection multiplying analyze show satisfaction also hold possibility applying sophisticated algebraic satisfaction coefficient thus also mathematical like anshel goldfeld used studying generating modular form also surprising property seidel seidel like seidel easy analyze give exponential parameter seidel parameter property topology graph planar graph parameter property encoded linear linear
