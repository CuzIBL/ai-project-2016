introduction 
     the aim of t h i s paper is a complete description of a system able to acquire workpieces which are arranged in an a r b i t r a r y way in a b i n . this problem is of most importance in production automation for it allows workpieces to be fed from bins into 
machines in an automatic way   1   . kelley and a l l .  solved the problem by using simple machine vision techniques and a surface adapting vacuum gripper. but  in many cases  the l i g h t i n t e n s i t y information is impraticable  see figure 1  and the information contained in the range data must be 
preferred. from this information the proposed method 
isolate a workpiece  or more generally  a part of a workpiece to be handled by a robot grasper  without recognizing the workpiece. the p r o p o s i t i o n   the o r i e n t a t i o n and the aperture of the grasper are then calculated in such a way as to optimize the success of the prehension. the workpiece is then posed on a table where it lays isolated and in a stable p o s i t i o n . in such a case  the recognition  precise o r i e n t a t i o n and transport toward machines are well understood problems . 
     the paper consists of three sections  rather autonomous  each with independent applications  but used together here to solve the grasping problem. in section ii the 1-d sensor is described. this sensor provides the three coordinates of a point of the surface of an object  i . e .   provides the z coordinate as a fuction of the x and y coordinates. the 1-d information is derived by means of stereo vision and of a laser beam to avoid the matching problem between the views. the o r i g i n a l i t y with respect to the use of l i g h t s t r i p i n g   1   or structured l i g h t   1   for range data acquisition is in 
the random acces owing to a great s i m p l i c i t y of software. section i i i presents a p a r t i c u l a r contour detector algorithm using the range data. it provides 
the silhouette of a v i s i b l e part of a workpiece. this silhouette is used in section iv to choose the grasp and the parameters of the robot hand. this method  based on an appropriate segmental ion and parametrisation of the s i l h o u e t t e   seems to be a general solution for the matching problem between a hand structure and an object s i l h o u e t t e . no a p r i o r i information about the workpieces is needed ; the only entries of the program are the parameters of the grasper. f i n a l l y   the last section is devoted to the performances of the system and to the simulation r e s u l t s . 
i. a 1d sensor 
     the sensor used is a sensor which gives the z coordinate of a point on the surface of an object as a function of the x and y coordinates. 
     it is based on the  active stereoscopy  p r i n ciple : stereoscopy because it uses at least two cameras to give images from d i f f e r e n t points of view ; active because the d i f f i c u l t problem in stereo v i s i o n of matching the two views is avoided by a strong l i g h t i n g of one point of the surface 
to be observed. 
1. general p r i n c i p l e 
　　　the strong l i g h t i n g is provided by a laser beam which can he swerved in two directions x and 
y. the deflection system is controllable and so the sensor is a random access one. the laser beam 
creates a l i t t l e spot on the surface which i s   by d i f f u s i o n   a secondary source of light and so creates two images on both cameras. it is then possible to calculate from the position of these images on 
both retinas and from the geometrical parameters of the cameras  the three coordinates x y z of the 
b r i g h t l y l i t point. this is done by means of the same simple geometrical formulas as in classical stereoscopy. 
1. the system under development 
　　　the p r i n c i p l e of the sensor is very simple ; the r e a l i s a t i o n is more tedious and needs the 
1 1 determination and coordination of four d i s t i n c t systems : the r e t i n a s   the optics of the cameras  the laser  the logical u n i t . 
     because of t h e i r poor resolution and geometrical d i s t o r t i o n   the vidicon type cameras or the image-dissectors cannot be used easily and do not give good r e s u l t s . solid phase receptors have been prefered. but in this category  the 1-d receptors are expensive and of poor resolution  at least as this paper is w r i t t e n   . this is why the cameras have photodiode array. note that each camera i n dicates one plane containing the overlighted point. at least three cameras are needed. 
b  the optics od the cameras 
     in addition to requiring the enough l i g h t on the r e t i n a s   we also need an anamorphoseur system to observe on a rectangular photodiode array  a 
scene which looks generally l i k e a square. that is the reason why c y l i n d r i c a l lenses are used. 
c  the optics of the laser 
     this system has two functions. f i r s t l y   the l a ser beam must be swerved in both the x and y directions. this can be done by means of an opto electronic device  but a system composed of mirrors steered by galvanometers is preferred. these are the only moving parts of the whole apparatus. secondly  the beam must be focussed. the optics are arranged so as to maintain the diameter of the laser beam constant and minimal in the whole pro-
blem domain ; this arrangement also depends on the parameters of the laser. 
d  the logical  uni t 
     each camera is associated with a microprocessor which essentially determines the s i g n i f i c a n t l y lighted diodes and performs an i n t e r p o l a t i o n to obtain a position which is accurate to l / 1 t n of a diode width. a second microprocessor controls the whole system  in p a r t i c u l a r the galvanometers  and performs the t r i a n g u l a t i o n from the data provided by each camera. 
     so this sensor is r e l a t i v e l y autonomous. the connection with another l o g i c a l u n i t   whose size depends on the a p p l i c a t i o n   is assumed by the second microprocessor. the exchanges between both are very few : the l o g i c a l unit sends to the sensor the two parameters of the d i r e c t i o n of the beam and receive as feedback the three coordinates x y z of the measured point. with the s p e c i f i c a t i o n s   the time of a measure is approximately 1 ms. 
i i . how to use the sensor to pick up workpieces from a bin 
     as we b r i e f l y mentionned  we do not want to recognize the workpieces in the bin and to calculate t h e i r o r i e n t a t i o n . this would involve great 
d i f f i c u l t i e s   and  in p a r t i c u l a r   would require the construction of a 1-d model of the workpieces  which is i t s e l f an open problem. 
     moreover  the workpiece probably slides a l i t t l e r e l a t i v e to the gripper during the prehension  and so it does not seem reasonable to require a very accurate o r i e n t a t i o n of the workpiece at this stage. thus we distinguish two steps in feeding 
workpieces from bins into machines : we pick up a workpiece from the bin and put it on to a table  and then we are able to solve the c l a s s i c a l problem of finding the o r i e n t a t i o n of a workpiece place in a stable p o s i t i o n . the aim of this paper is to present a method which uses the above sensor  to solve the f i r s t step. the second step is widely exposed in the l i t t e r a t u r e   1   . 
       instead of recognizing a workpiece  we just want to extract some information which seems 
reasonably s u f f i c i e n t to isolate one workpiece not 
wedged by other - t h i s is the object of section i i and to calculate the places where to put the f i n gers of the gripper system- this is the object of section i i i - . 
　　　therefore  we want at f i r s t to f i n d a part of a workpiece which is on the top of the b i n and that the robot could grasp. this is performed by the algorithm b r i e f l y described below which looks for the  break points    i . e .   the points where there is 
a large gradient az in z  around a given point : 
i  choose n a r b i t r a r y points in the b i n   mea-
sure t h e i r coordinates and keep the one whose z is the largest  called the o r i g i n in the f o l l o w i n g . this assures that we work on a workpiece on the top of the bin presumed not to be wedged by others. i i   cloose an a r b i t r a r y d i r e c t i o n . 
i i i   go from the o r i g i n in this d i r e c t i o n u n t i l 
you find a large az. if the breakpoint is farther than d from the o r i g i n   go to v   . 
iv  follow the break by measuring succesively 
top and bottom points u n t i l no break point is found. 
v  calculate the polar angles of the end points 
of the break which define an observed sector. if i i i   f a i l e d   this is one angle. 
	v i   	if there are observations for enough d i r e c -
tions : end. if not choose the bissecting of the largest non-observed sector and return to i i i   . 
　- this algorithm produces a chain of points in ft  the break points  which defines in some sense the silhouette of a workpiece. this silhouette may be a closed curve or more generally several curves corresponding to the regions with a well defined break. of course  we are not sure that the s i l h o u ette is the silhouette of only one workpiece and that the workpiece is not wedged  but the r i s k is 
minimized. 
　　　f i n a l l y a piecewise linear approximation of the silhouette is stored for further investigations. 

1. positioning the fingers of the grasper 
　　this section is devoted to the determination of the possible ways to grasp the workpiece assumed to be defined by its silhouette. to grip securely the workpiece we need first to put the grasper in 
a stable position along the silhouette and then to guarantee that the workpiece w i l l stay in the grasper and not f a l l down or stay in the bin. the first problem and more d i f f i c u l t   is the subject of this section. the second one is solved  if necessary by the heuristics described in section iv. 
　　to position  without sliding  a grasper of a defined type along a silhouette is a matching problem complicated by a mechanical problem : the definition of stability. the matching problem has been extensively studied  but the methods used  even the most sophisticated  like relaxation 
in   are too slow to be efficient in robotics. on the other hand  the more specialised problem of stable prehension of an unknown object has received very l i t t l e attention and only in particular cases   1   .   1       . 
　　the approach presented here is based on three simple ideas : 
i  if we analyse locally the behaviour of the 
grasper  the problem becomes easier ; more precisely  we shall see that the different cases reduce to three. 
i i   we choose a parametrisation of the silhouet-
te more efficient that the chain of cartesian coodinates of its vertices. the parametrisation provides a simple analytic solution and a fast algorithm. moreover  though the principle of the method is presented for a plane silhouette and a two fingers grasper  the method may easily be generalized to a number of graspers and to nonplanar silhouettes . 
i i i   the stability condition w i l l be essential-
ly geometrical and is related to the fact that the grasper can only close  i.e.  the fingers can only be brought closer together. 
　　as mentionned in section i i   the silhouette is composed of one or more non-crossing polygonal lines. by convention  the silhouette will be oriented in such a way that the normal points to the workpiece   i . e .   the external contour is clockwise  the holes counter-clockwise . 
　　the grasper is defined as an ordered set of fingers whose relative positions and directions of tightening verify some constraints. 
　　a position of the grasper along the silhouette is said to be stable i f   when tightening   i . e .   when the fingers tend to move along their directions of tightening   it does not leave the 
workpiece. 
　　the organisation of the section is the f o l lowing ; f i r s t   we define a segmentation of the 

     these definitions yield the t r i v i a l proposition : a finger with a lenght less than l can only touch the silhouette at points belonging to one 
primitive. 
     we now introduce a parametrisation of the primitives which corresponds to the intuitive idea that positioning the finger d on to a primitive p 
requires three conditions : d must be near p  must not intersect with the workpiece and must be correctly oriented. 
four parameters are sufficient to define each

p r i m i t i v e . thus the convex and concave primitives are characterised by t h e i r associated oriented segment. so in every case  the parametrisation of a p r i m i t i v e is equivalent to the parametrisation of an oriented segment. 
     let {r} denote a reference frame whose o r i g i n is 1. we c a l l the parameters of an oriented segment v the 1-tuple   l   a   d   h   where l is the euclidian norm of v  a i t s o r i e n t a t i o n d and h the coordinates of i t s middle m expressed in the frame {r} by the r o t a t i o n  1 a . 

1. stable positioning of a grasper along the silhouette 
　　　the problem i s   now  the positioning of the d i f f e r e n t fingers of the grasper along the s i l h o u e t t e . we r e s t r i c t our study to the case of a grasper with two i d e n t i c a l fingers  see figure 1 . the generalisation to other types of graspers is 

	straightforward 	  1   . 
a p o s i t i o n of the grasper w i l l be said stable if the fingers are in stable position in the sense 
of ′1 and if the distancebetween them passes through a local minimum d i f f e r e n t from 1. this d e f i n i t i o n implies that a grasp associates two p r i m i t i v e s   
and that some associations of p r i m i t i v e s cannot y i e l d a stable grasp. we only have to consider the following cases : the  trapezoid   s s   the 
	  t r i a n g l e   	 s v   	the   b u t t e r f l y   	 c c   	the 
the workpiece. it is proved in  1   that  for the three types of p r i m i t i v e s   the f i r s t condition is a fonction of 1 exclusively  the second one of 1 and 1  the t h i r d one of 1 and ♀. this property w i l l y i e l d an a n a l y t i c a l solution in the case of several coupled f i n g e r s . 　　　finding a grasp for the grasper is equivalent to finding the conditions under which two primitives forming one of the above configurations  make a grasp. these conditions are obtained by w r i t i n g the 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　  t u n n e l   	 s c  the parameters of the oriented segment associated with the p r i m i t i v e p are called the parameters of p and we w r i t e p -   l   a   d   h   . 
     s i m i l a r l y   	the parameters of the finger d are those of i t s edge oriented in such a way that it 
forms with the d i r e c t i o n of tightening a d i r e c t frame. it is noted d -   l   1   1   e . 
     the stable positioning of a finger p on to a p r i m i t i v e i' involves three conditions : 	the o r i e n t a t i o n of d toassure the s t a b i l i t y   	the l a t e r a l po-
s i t i o n i n g to assure that v w i l l reach f  and the 
positioning normal to the orientation of the p r i m i -
tive of d to assure that p does not intersect with 
conditions of the stable positioning of each finger and by reducing the number of variables owing to the constraints of the grasp. it is shown in  that for each configuration the solution is simple and a n a l y t i c . a few tests on the parameters of the primitives allow to know if two primitives constit-
ute a grasp  and  if so  the possible positions for the grasper. as an example  we give the t r i v i a l case of the trapezoid for which the conditions are : 


iv. experimental study 
     the bin to be observed is a cubical one  1 cm wide. for i n d u s t r i a l reasons the whole sensor  camera  laser  and i t s optics  must be 1 m from the ground. to observe the whole bin whose edges are not transparent the cameras must not be more than 1 cm from the b i n ' s axis. this is a very disadbantageous condition for the   z   precision because the stereoscopic angle is only 1＜. the experimental sensor has 1 photodiodes arrays and thus we obtain a precision of 1 mm in z and one of 1 mm in x and y. this is superfulous in the following example  where the maximum length of the workpieces are about 1 cm : in this case  
simulation shows that a precision of 1 mm is s u f f i c i e n t   and hence  the length of the photodiodes arrays might be reduced. 
     a 1 mwatt laser is used  with a diameter equal to 1 mm having a divergence of 1 mrad. the optics composed of four lenses keep the diameter constant and equal to 1 mm on the e n t i r e bin. 
     figure 1 shows a photograph of the b i n . one notices that i n t e n s i t y data does not permit extraction of outlines of workpieces. in figure 1   a     the dotted lines represent the laser beam's course from an o r i g i n to a breakpoint  and the along the outline of a workpiece on the top of the b i n . the continuous line is the piecewise linear approximation of the s i l h o u e t t e . figure 1   b       c      d  shows three possible grasps among the best ones. the c r i t e r i a used to order the grasps is the c r i t e r i a defined in section i i i 1 added with some h e u r i s t i c s that prevent the workpiece to f a l l down or stay in the b i n   based on the r e l a t i v e position of the grasp and the estimated moments of i n e r t i a of the workpiece. 
in that application the sensor is used as a fast edge detector  allowing to i s o l a t e a workpiece or part of a workpiece on the top of the b i n . then a general algorithm defines the possible grasps along the silhouette  a representation of the object to 
be handled is not required ; it may be used to solve many other problems of automatic prehension  
when the object is unknown or when a p a r t i c u l a r o r i e n t a t i o n of the object is not needed.
