introduction 
	this paper describes the present state of 	the 
vocal speech understanding system. b r i e f l y   vocal is a complete  self-contained speech understanding system that has undergone s u f f i c i e n t t e s t i n g to i n dicate that it has p o t e n t i a l both as a p r a c t i c a l voice programming system and as a research t o o l for the i n v e s t i g a t i o n of more general problems of n a t u r a l   spoken man/machine communication. 
       vocal i n t e r p r e t s a spoken utterance as the well formed  meaningful sentence that sounds most l i k e i t s acoustic t r a n s c r i p t i o n of the input according to a q u a n t i t a t i v e s i m i l a r i t y measure and demonstrates i t s understanding by compiling the i n put i n t o executable machine language code. to accomplish t h i s   vocal uses several r e l a t i v e l y simple procedures linked by a c o n t r o l s t r u c t u r e - the vocal language was designed to be simple and powerf u l in specifying numerical algorithms. within the c o n s t r a i n t s of small vocabulary and simple syntax  the vocal language bears a reasonable s i m i l a r i t y to the special subset of english used by a mathematician to describe equations he is w r i t i n g on a black-board. f i n a l l y   vocal is f a s t   e f f i c i e n t   and p o r t a b l e . 
　　　vocal operates on a l i m i t e d vocabulary  as a l l speech understanding systems do  1 1 1  1   . sentences are spoken by cooperative subjects in quiet rooms. the vocal syntax is w e l l defined by a mathematical model and the problem domain is l i m i t e d to a specialized task so that h e u r i s t i c s for semantic analysis are a p p l i c a b l e . 
       vocal does not  however  accept t r u l y c o n t i n u ous speech i n p u t . our data was recorded under ideal conditions and the subjects were required to a r t i c u l a t e c l e a r l y . thus vocal can r e l i a b l y locate word boundaries by detecting b r i e f pauses between words. as a r e s u l t   vocal begins i t s acoustic processing at the l e x i c a l rather than the phonemic l e v e l . 
　　　there are 1 words in the vocal lexicon     t o   and  two  are considered the same word at the acoustic l e v e l   so that word i d e n t i f i c a t i o n becomes a d i f f i c u l t but t r a c t a b l e pattern recognition problem. 
       at the acoustic l e v e l   vocal represents l e x i cal information in the form of a spectrogram. an extremely e f f i c i e n t fast fourier transform  fft  generates the spectrogram  which contains a l l the information necessary for word r e c o g n i t i o n in suff i c i e n t l y compact form so that the f u l l power of mathematical pattern recognition techniques can be brought to bear.  very early work by p o t t e r   kopp  and kopp  and recent v e r i f i c a t i o n by k l a t t and stevens  demonstrate that a s p e c t r o gram can contain a l l t h i s i n f o r m a t i o n   although the more recent trend in acoustic signal processing has been toward d i g i t a l f i l t e r i n g  and 
p r e d i c t i v e coding  1 1  f o r s p e c t r a l estimat i o n .   
       in order to solve the grammatical problem of parsing u n r e l i a b l y transcribed input s t r i n g s   1   1     the parser is permitted to i n s e r t h y p o t h e t i cal words or s t r i n g s based on acoustic and semant i c information while processing the i n p u t . 
       the d i f f i c u l t y often encountered is p r o v i d i n g a speech understanding system w i t h semantic capab i l i t i e s was p a r t l y solved by the choice of problem domain. cherry  defines semantics as the r e l a t i o n s h i p between the symbols of a language and the real objects or concepts for which they stand. for the vocal system the objects to which the symbols are r e l a t e d are sets of machine language i n s t r u c t i o n s that cause the computer to perform the operations s p e c i f i e d by those symbols. the semant i c r e l a t i o n s h i p s are those required by an o r d i n ary compiler for the vocal language. 
　　　the c o n t r o l s t r u c t u r e of vocal has two important p r o p e r t i e s . f i r s t   information e x t r a c t e d at each l e v e l of processing is used by every other l e v e l . second  the actual strategy used by vocal to understand a sentence is l a r g e l y determined by that utterance of that sentence. in t h i s process  no absolute q u a n t i t a t i v e c r i t e r i a   e . g . e m p i r i c a l ly determined confidence l e v e l s   are used and no unbounded computations   e . g . exhaustive searches  are performed. 
       f i n a l l y   there is the matter of the cost of speech understanding computations in processing time and resources. because vocal is coded in fortran at a l e v e l very close to the machine and uses e f f i c i e n t fft  p a t t e r n r e c o g n i t i o n   and p a r s ing a l g o r i t h m s   it has only modest core r e q u i r e ments and w i l l run on-line in r e a l time on large minicomputers or medium-size machines. if the s p e c t r a l analysis is performed by an e a s i l y constructed bank of f i v e analog bandpass f i l t e r s   the

system can run on-line in r e a l time even on a small minicomputer. this opens up avenues for t e s t i n g   evaluation  and development that are closed to l a r ger systems. 
the vocal system 
　　　vocal is currently organized i n t o one main program and six subroutines. the main program  called cntrl  governs  and records for subsequent analysis  a l l of the operations of the subroutines. the subroutines and t h e i r tasks are l i s t e d below. 
        1  spgrm generates the spectrogram of s i n g l e word utterances. 
        1  swifft is a special purpose fast fourier transform algorithm used to compute short duration spectra. 
        1  knn1 is the pattern recognition algorithm. it uses a generalized k-nearest-neighbor scheme with preprocessing 	  1   . 
        a  pause is a push-down automaton that not only accepts w e l l formed sentences but also makes hypothetical insertions where the acoustic t r a n s c r i p t i o n leads to an ungraramatical s t r i n g . 
        1  semant forms hypotheses about the meaning of a sentence from clues it finds in the acoustic t r a n s c r i p t i o n and grammatical s t r u c t u r e . 
        1  compil generates machine language code corresponding to the f i n a l interpreted meaning of input sentences. unfortunately t h i s routine is 
machine-dependent  so it now stops short of generating the actual machine language code and merely sets up the i n t e r n a l form representation from which the code can be generated. 
acoustic 	processing 
spgrm performs a l l of the signal processing r e quired to segment the speech along word bounaries and produce a compact representation of the spectrograms of each of the words. 
　　　word boundaries are located by a simple thresholding technique. when the signal drops to a r e l a t i v e minimum and remains at that l e v e l for several consecutive samples  a word boundary is assumed . 
　　　the f i r s t stage in the generation of a spectrogram is the sampling of the short duration spectrum of the speech waveform every 1 msec  and storing the results in a matrix s *=  smn  given by equation   1   . 


　　　the result of these transformations is a 1 matrix that represents the normalized time and frequency smoothed spectrogram of a single spoken 
word. 
　　　the discrete fourier transform  dft  i m p l i c i t in equation  1  is a c t u a l l y performed by the special-purpose fft algorithm of subroutine swifft. the desired speed is achieved in t h i s a l gorithm by employing a l l of the f o l l o w i n g techniques : 
1  real transform of length n computed as a complex transform of length n/1 
1  mixed radix representation of subscripts 	 1  
1  pruning the f i r s t stage to account for the zero padding  
1  elimination of a l l t r i v i a l operations  e.g. m u l t i p l i c a t i o n by 1  ＼1  
1  i n - l i n e coding with no loops and no address calculations 
1  no e x p l i c i t binary s o r t . 
pattern 	recognition 
knn1 is the pattern recognition subroutine. 	it performs two separate operations  	feature select i o n and nearest neighbor o r d e r i n g   	i m p l i c i t 	in 
which is the 	i d e n t i f i c a t i o n process. 
　　　the feature selection process is accomplished by means of a karhunen loeve expansion applied to feature s e l e c t i o n problems according to methods described by meisel  and patrick   1   . recall that the spectrogram for each word is represented 
by the 1 matrix  s   of equation   1   . let y be a 1-vector whose components  yi. 1   i   1  are the elements of s  ordered columnwise. we reduce t h i s vector  y  to a ten-dimensional vector  x  by the l i n e a r transformation t. 
 a  x = t y. 
1 t is a matrix whose rows are the eigenvectors c o r responding to the ten largest eigenvalues of an estimate of the covariance matrix u of the t r a i n i n g set. that i s . 
of course  the computations described by equations   1       1       1     and  1  are done only once in an o f f - l i n e step and the matrix t is stored in knn1  which simply uses the transformation according to equation  1  to get a ten-feature representation of a spectrogram. 
       an examination of the eigenvalues of  from equation  1  reveals that the i n t r i n s i c dimensiona l i t y of the feature space is between 1 and 1. that i s    becomes very small for  1. but in order to keep the i m p l i c i t estimates of the probab i l i t y d i s t r i b u t i o n f u n c t i o n of the feature values consistent with the number of samples in the t r a i n ing data  we r e s t r i c t e d ourselves to a ten-dimen-
sional 	approximation. 
　　the next function of knn1 is to use the vector from equation  1  in the generalized k nearest neighbor decision rule of patrick 	 	to c l a s s i f y an utterance. 
parse is the subroutine that performs the necessary analysis for understanding a sentence. parse also serves as a   f r o n t end  for the f i n a l compilation of subroutine compil. 
are evaluated where 
	equation  1  	insures 	that 	the grammar 
1        vocal has 1 symbols and eleven d i f f e r e n t sentence schemata  most of which have two forms. the f i r s t form permits the use of l i n e numbers  which compil t r e a t s as i n s t r u c t i o n addresses. the second form is a  stand alone  form in which each sentence is a complete program unto i t s e l f . these command structures are of three types  executive   e . g . s t a r t   stop  e d i t     minor u t i l i t y   e . g . unconditional branching  subroutine l i n k i n g   i n p u t     and major u t i l i t y   e . g . c o n d i t i o n a l branching  assignment  indexing . the t h i r d are the r e a l work horses of the language and contain arithmetic expressions composed of variables that may or may not be subscripted  f l o a t i n g - p o i n t cons t a n t s   and a l l the usual a r i t h m e t i c operators  d e l i m i t e r s   and elementary f u n c t i o n s . 
equation  1  then defines the operation of m as f o l l o w s . on scanning input symbol a w i t h nonterminal symbol a on top of the stack  accept a and replace a by the s t r i n g a. if the stack is empty a f t e r the input sentence has been scanned  it is a w e l l formed sentence in l g . this operat i o n is the heart of parse. 
　　　the t r a n s i t i o n function of equation  1  is stored in the form of a table w i t h two levels of p o i n t e r s . one is for i n t e r n a l use and insures that the table w i l l be scanned e f f i c i e n t l y according to an algorithm described by gries   1     the second l e v e l provides a l i n k to semant  which we s h a l l describe s h o r t l y . 
　　　in addition to determining whether a sentence is w e l l formed  parse is also capable of i n s e r t i n g 
words according to the ordering of  1c  in a sentence to replace grammatically i n c o r r e c t ones. this replacement routine involves a l i n k to the acoustic and semantic levels and w i l l therefore be discussed when we consider the control s t r u c t u r e . 
semantic analysis 
the function of semant is to determine the meaning   i n terms of what c1mpil can understand  of w e l l formed sentences. semant generates these hypotheses on the basis of acoustic and grammatical clues plus some tabulated knowledge of i t s own. 
　　　semant treats phrases and sentences as meani n g f u l if compil can either make appropriate ent r i e s in i t s symbol table   e . g . data or i n s t r u c t i o n addresses  or can generate code   e . g . to compute the value of an arithmetic expression . for example  the word  seven  by i t s e l f is semantically meaningless but the phrase  x seven  is a variable for which compil would assign a storage l o c a t i o n . or the phrase  three point seven  could be a l i n e number for which compil would assign an entry address. semant scans the input s t r i n g s for clues and uses acoustic information to form the best phrase  the smallest metric computed from equation  1b   having the assumed meaning. information concerning the grammatical structure of the phrase is contained in the t r a n s i t i o n function of equation  1 . the appropriate set of production rules are located by the second l e v e l of pointers in parse described above. for example  the words   t h r e e   and  one  in the phrase three     one         
would serve as a clue to semant that a f l o a t i n g point constant was present. semant would then go to the t r a n s i t i o n table and look up the production rules for the formation of f l o a t i n g - p o i n t numbers. then  r e f e r r i n g to the values of the distance funct i o n computed by knn1 according to equation   1 b     the best such phrase would be formed and the result might be 
three point one four one. 
       semant forms four hypothetical command structures  since there are four major u t i l i t y i n s t r u c t i o n s   . the arguments of the command s t r u c t u r e are resolved   e . g . variable names  l i n e numbers   and f i n a l l y a r i t h m e t i c expressions are determined including proper parenthesizing. if the chosen command s t r u c t u r e cannot contain an arithmetic expression  of course  semant does not look for clues for one. 
       compil is not a necessary part of the speech understanding process but rather provides a means by which vocal can demonstrate that it has indeed understood a sentence. unfortunately a subrout i n e that produces machine language code is nece s s a r i l y machine-dependent. for that reason  compil has been purposely l e f t u n f i n i s h e d . in i t s present s t a t e   compil simply puts a sentence in a convenient i n t e r n a l form from which the appropriate subroutines could generate the object code. 
	control 	structure 
the organization of vocal is shown in f i g u r e 1. in t h i s diagram the single lines represent l o g i c paths and the double l i n e s   data paths. the r e quired control of i t s operation is performed by the main program  cntrl  and may be described as f o l l o w s . 
　　　d i g i t i z e d speech is processed to produce the nearest neighbor ordering for each word in the sentence according to equations  1b  and   1 c   . these r e s u l t s are stored for l a t e r use. 
　　　the sentence is then parsed. if the acoust i c t r a n s c r i p t i o n of the sentence is grammatically w e l l formed then a l l processing ends since no 
b e t t e r i n t e r p r e t a t i o n for the sentence can be found. 
　　most o f t e n   however  m i s c l a s s l f i c a t l o n s do occur  and they r e s u l t in ungrammatical s t r i n g s . in t h i s case the parser replaces the i n c o r r e c t word by other words in the vocabulary in the o r dering  1c  for the of fending word. 	the values of the discriminant functions of 	 1b  are added up as the sentence is parsed. 	when the e n t i r e sentence has been scanned t h i s t o t a l is a measure of the s i m i l a r i t y of the modified s t r i n g to the acoustic t r a n s c r i p t i o n . 	for example  l e t the acoustic t r a n s c r i p t i o n of the sentence h1 be r e p -
