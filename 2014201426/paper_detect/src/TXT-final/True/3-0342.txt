
in this paper  we investigate the relationship between two prioritized knowledge bases by measuring both the conflict and the agreement between them. first of all  a quantity of conflict and two quantities of agreement are defined. the former is shown to be a generalization of the dalal distance. the latter are  respectively  a quantity of strong agreement which measures the amount of information on which two belief bases  totally  agree  and a quantity of weak agreement which measures the amount of information that is believed by one source but is unknown to the other. all three quantity measures are based on the weighted prime implicant  which represents beliefs in a prioritized belief base. we then define a degree of conflict and two degrees of agreement based on our quantity of conflict and the quantities of agreement. we also consider the impact of these measures on belief merging and information source ordering.
1 introduction
in the belief revision and belief merging literature  the wellknown dalal distance known as the hamming distance between interpretations  dalal  1   plays a key role in the notion of minimal change. the dalal distance between two interpretations models how many atoms are in conflict  so it measures only the quantity of conflict between them. hunter has defined a degree of conflict between two knowledge bases based on the dalal distance  hunter  1 .
¡¡in recent years  relationships between two knowledge bases have been defined by measures of information and contradiction. in  konieczny et al.  1   a degree of contradiction and a degree of ignorance were defined and they can be used to order the sources of information. if a knowledge base has a high degree of contradiction and a low degree of ignorance  then it has a low order. in  hunter  1   some compromise relations between two knowledge bases were defined according to the quantities of conflict information and total information in them.
¡¡in all the relationships described above  the quantity of conflict information between two knowledge bases was focused upon. however  in reality  when establishing the relationships between two agents  not only information in conflict  but also information in agreement should be considered. the quantities of conflict and agreement can affect each other. considering two agents with low quantity of conflict between them  our perception of the degree of conflict between them will be further weakened if they have a lot in common. furthermore  when two agents have no information in conflict  it is useful to consider the agreement between them.
¡¡we use two quantities of agreement; one is called the quantity of strong agreement which measures the information that both agents  totally  agree with  and the other is called the quantity of weak agreement which measures the information that is believed by one source but is unknown to the other. both quantities will influence the degree of conflict  but their influences are different. intuitively  the quantity of strong agreement will have more influence on the degree of conflict than the quantity of weak agreement. to illustrate  let us consider the following three knowledge bases: b1 = {¦Õ ¦×}  b1 = { ¦Õ ¦×}  and b1 = { ¦Õ}. b1 is in conflict with both b1 and b1. b1 and b1 strongly agree on ¦×  whilst b1 only weakly agrees with b1 on ¦×. clearly the degree of conflict between b1 and b1 should be smaller than that between b1 and b1 because there is a topic that both b1 and b1 agree opon. however  when defining the degree of conflict  hunter  1   hunter did not distinguish the influences of strong agreement and weak agreement. to accompany the degree of conflict  we can define a degree of strong agreement and a degree of weak agreement.
¡¡in this paper  we will measure the conflict and agreement between two prioritized knowledge bases  where the priority of a formula  based on necessity degrees  is handled in possibilistic logic. it is well-known that priority plays an important role in inconsistency handling  belief revision and belief merging  gardenfors  1; konieczny & ramon ¡§ 1; benferhat et al.  1 . possibilistic logic provides a good framework for expressing priority. we first define the weighted prime implicant  wpi   which is a generalization of the regular prime implicant to possibilistic logic. then  the measures of conflict and agreement will be defined by wpis.
¡¡this paper is organized as follows. section 1 gives some preliminaries. we then define the weighted prime implicant and measures of conflict and agreement in section 1. section 1 discusses the impact of the measures of conflict and agreement. finally we conclude the paper in section 1.
1 preliminaries
classical logic: in this paper  we consider a propositional language lps from a finite set ps of propositional symbols. the classical consequence relation is denoted as `. an interpretation is a total function from ps to {true false}.   is the set of all possible interpretations. an interpretation w is a model of a formula ¦Õ iff w ¦Õ  = true. p q r ... represent atoms in ps. a literal is an atom p or its negation  p. we will denote literals by l l1 .. and formulae in lps by ¦Õ ¦× ¦Ã ... for each formula ¦Õ  we use m ¦Õ  to denote its set of models. a classical knowledge base b is a finite set of propositional formulae. b is consistent iff there exists an interpretation w such that w ¦Õ  = true for all ¦Õ¡Êb. a clause c is a disjunction of literals: c = l1¡Å...¡Åln and its dual clause  or term d  is a conjunction of literals: d = l1¡Ä...¡Äln.
possibilistic logic  dubois et al.  1 : possibilistic logic is a weighted logic where each classical logic formula is associated with a number in  1   a necessity degree  which represents the extent to which the formula is true. a possibilistic knowledge base  pkb  is the set of possibilistic formulae of the form b = { ¦Õi  ¦Ái  : i = 1 ... n}. possibilistic formula
 ¦Õi  ¦Ái  means that the necessity degree of ¦Õi is at least equal to ¦Ái. a classical knowledge base b = {¦Õi : i = 1 ... n} corresponds to a pkb b1 = { ¦Õi 1  : i = 1 ... n}. in this paper  we consider only pkbs where every formula ¦Õ is a classical propositional formula. the classical base associated with b is denoted as b   namely b  = {¦Õi| ¦Õi  ¦Ái  ¡Ê b}.
a pkb is consistent iff its classical base is consistent.
¡¡semantically  the most basic and important notion is possibility distribution ¦Ð:   ¡ú  1 . ¦Ð ¦Ø  represents the possibility degree of interpretation ¦Ø with available beliefs. from possibility distribution ¦Ð  two measures can be determined  one is the possibility degree of formula ¦Õ  defined as ¦° ¦Õ  = max{¦Ð ¦Ø  : ¦Ø |= ¦Õ}  the other is the necessity degree of formula ¦Õ  defined as n ¦Õ  = 1   ¦°  ¦Õ . the possibility measure is max-decomposable  i.e. ¦° ¦Õ ¡Å ¦×  = max ¦° ¦Õ  ¦° ¦×  . whilst the necessity measure is mindecomposable  i.e. n ¦Õ ¡Ä ¦×  = min n ¦Õ  ¦° ¦×  .
definition 1  dubois et al.  1  let b be a pkb  and ¦Á ¡Ê  1 . the ¦Á-cut of b is b¡Ý¦Á =
{¦Õ¡Êb | ¦Õ a ¡Êb and a¡Ý¦Á}.
definition 1  dubois et al.  1  let b be a pkb. a formula ¦Õ is said to be a possibilistic consequence of b to degree a  denoted by b`¦Ð ¦Õ a   iff the following conditions hold:  1  b¡Ýa is consistent;  1  b¡Ýa`¦Õ;  1   b a  b¡Ýb 1` ¦Õ.
1 measures of conflicts and agreements
1 weighted prime implicant
in this section  we will define and discuss weighted prime implicants of pkbs.
¡¡a term d is an implicant of formula ¦Õ iff d`¦Õ and d does not contain two complementary literals.
definition 1  cadoli & donini  1  a prime implicant of knowledge base b is an implicant d of b such that for every other implicant d1 of b  d1`d1.
¡¡prime implicants are often used in knowledge compilation  cadoli & donini  1  to make the deduction tractable. suppose d1  ...  dk are all the prime implicants of b  we have b`¦Õ  for any ¦Õ iff for every prime implicant di  di`¦Õ. now we define weighted prime implicants of a pkb. let us first define weighted prime implicants for pkb b = { ¦Õ1 a1  ...  ¦Õn an } where ¦Õi are clauses. for a more general pkb  we can decompose it to an equivalent pkb whose formulae are clauses by the min-decomposability of necessity measures  i.e.  n ¡Äi=1 k¦Õi ¡Ým  i n ¦Õi ¡Ým.
¡¡let b = { ¦Õ1 a1  ...  ¦Õn an } be a pkb where ¦Õi are clauses. a weighted implicant of b is d = { ¦×1 b1  ...  ¦×k bk }  a pkb  such that d `¦Ð b  where ¦×i are literals. let d and d1 be two weighted implicants of b  d is said to be more specific than d1 iff d=1 d1  d1  d  and   ¦×i ai ¡Êd   ¦×i bi ¡Êd1 with bi¡Üai.
definition 1 let b = { ¦Õ1 a1  ...  ¦Õn an } be a pkb where ¦Õi are clauses. a weighted prime implicant  wpi  of b is d such that
1. d is a weighted implicant of b
1. 1   d1 of b such that d is more specific than d1.
¡¡let us look at an example to illustrate how to construct wpis.
example 1 let b = { p 1   q¡År 1   q ¡Å  s 1 } be a pkb. the wpis of b are d1 = { p 1   q 1 }  d1 = { p 1   r 1    s 1 }  and d1 =
{ p 1   q 1    s 1 }.
the wpi generalizes the prime implicant.
proposition 1 let b = { ¦Õ1  ...  ¦Õn 1 } be a pkb which contains formulae with weight 1  i.e.  b is a classical knowledge base. then d is a wpi of b iff d is a prime implicant of b.
¡¡however  given pkb b  if d is a wpi of b  then d  is not necessarily a prime implicant of b . a counterexample can be found in example 1  where d1 is a wpi  but d {p q  s} is not a prime implicant of b .
¡¡the following proposition says that wpis can be used to compile a pkb.
proposition 1 let b be a pkb. if d1 ... dn are all the wpis of b  then for any formula ¦Õ  we have 
b`¦Ð ¦Õ a  iff di`¦Ð ¦Õ a   for all di.
next we give some justification for the wpi.
¡¡first of all  to measure information in a single classical knowledge base  this knowledge base may be inconsistent   most of the current methods are based on the models of the knowledge base  hunter  1; lozinskii  1 . in  hunter  1   the degree of inconsistency is measured based on the model of an inconsistent knowledge base in the framework of quasi-classical logic. in  lozinskii  1   a quasi-model of an inconsistent knowledge base  which is a maximal consistent subbase of the knowledge base  is defined to measure information for inconsistent sets. by definition 1  each wpi can be interpreted as a partial truth assignment. suppose p is an atom and d is a wpi  then  p a ¡Êd means that there is an argument for p in d with certainty degree a  and   p b ¡Êd means that there is an argument against p in d with certainty degree b  while ¦Õ1¡Êd  means the truth value of ¦Õ is undetermined in d. by proposition 1  a wpi can be viewed as a partial model of a possibilistic knowledge base. this is consistent with the methods in  hunter  1; lozinskii  1 .
¡¡second  when all the formulae in a pkb have the same weight 1  a wpi is a prime implicant. in classical logic  a classical model is often used to define the distance between two knowledge bases  dalal  1 . however  classical models are not suitable for us to define the quantities of agreement between knowledge bases because a classical model must assign a truth value to every atom in the knowledge bases. let us look at the example in the introduction again. the only model for b1 is w = {¦Õ ¦×} and there are two models for b1  i.e.  w1 = { ¦Õ ¦×} and w1 = { ¦Õ  ¦×}. b1 and b1 weakly agree on ¦× because only b1 supports ¦×. however  by comparing w with w1 or comparing w with w1 we cannot get such a conclusion. in contrast  a prime implicant can be viewed as a partial truth assignment. that is  only some of the atoms are assigned truth values. given a prime implicant d of b  a three-value semantics can be associated with it as follows:
	true	if d ` p 
vd p  =false	if d `  p 	 1  undetermined	otherwise.
in the example  b1 has one prime implicant d1 = {¦Õ ¦×} and b1 has one prime implicant d1 = { ¦Õ}  where d1 does not contain any information on ¦×; so the quantity of weak agreement between d1 and d1 is 1. as a consequence  the weak agreement between b1 and b1 is 1  which is consistent with our analysis above.
1 quantity of conflict and quantities of agreement
in this section  we will measure the quantities of conflict and agreement between two pkbs based on the wpi.
first we define the quantity of conflict between two wpis.
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pkbs. suppose c and d are wpis of b1 and b1 respectively  then the quantity of conflict between c and d is defined as
	qcon c d  =	x	min a b .	 1 
 p a ¡Êc and   p b ¡Êd
when all the weights are 1  qcon c d  is the cardinality of the set of atoms which are in conflict in c¡Èd.
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pkbs. suppose c and d are the sets of wpis of b1 and b1 respectively  then the quantity of conflict between b1 and b1 is defined as
	qcon b1 b1  = min{qcon c d |c¡Êc  d¡Êd}.	 1 
the quantity of conflict between b1 and b1 measures the minimum amount of information in conflict between them.
example 1 let b1	=	{  p 1    q ¡Å r 1 } and
b1	=	{ p ¡Å  r 1   q 1 } be two pkbs.	the wpis of b1 are c1 = {  p 1    q 1 } and c1 =
{  p 1   r 1 } 	and the wpis of b1 are d1	=
{ p 1   q 1 } and d1 = {  r 1   q 1 }. it is easy to calculate that qcon c1 d1  = 1  qcon c1 d1  = 1  qcon c1 d1  = 1  qcon c1 d1  = 1. therefore  the quantity of conflict between b1 and b1 is 1.
proposition 1 let b  b1 and b1 be three pkbs. if b1 b1  then qcon b b1  ¡Üqcon b b1 .
proposition 1 tells us that the quantity of conflict between two pkbs will increase  not strictly  when one of them has some new information added.
¡¡let x be a set of classical propositional formulae. let i x  be the set of interpretations of x delineated by the atoms used in x  i.e. i x  = 1atoms x   where atom x  denotes the set of atoms appearing in x . let m x y   be the set of models of x that are in i y  . that is  m x y   = {w|=¡Äx|w¡Êi y  }. the dalal distance  dalal  1  between two models wi  wj of a classical formula is the hamming distance between them  i.e.  dalal wi wj  = |wi   wj| + |wj   wi|.
proposition 1 let b1 and b1 be two consistent classical knowledge bases. let dalal  b1 b1  = min
{dalal wi wj |wi¡Êm b1 b1¡Èb1  wj¡Êm b1 b1¡Èb1 }. then we have
qcon b1 b1  = dalal b1 b1 .
proposition 1 is very important  because it reveals that our quantity of conflict coincides with the dalal distance in classical logic. therefore  the quantity of conflict qcon b1 b1  can be taken as a generalization of the dalal distance.
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pkbs. suppose c and d are wpis of b1 and b1 respectively  then the quantity of strong agreement between c and d is defined as
	qsa c d  =	x	min a b  	 1 
¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ p a ¡Êc   p b ¡Êd when all the weights are 1  qcon c d  is the cardinality of the set of literals that are in both c and d.
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pkbs. suppose c and d are the sets of wpis of b1 and b1 respectively  then the quantity of strong agreement between b1 and b1 is defined as
	qsa b1 b1  = max{qsa c d |c¡Êc  d¡Êd}.	 1 
the quantity of strong agreement between b1 and b1 measures how much information is supported by both b1 and b1.
example 1  continue example 1  by equation 1  we have qsa c1 d1  = qsa c1 d1  = 1 and qsa c1 d1  = qsa c1 d1  = 1. therefore  the quantity of strong agreement between b1 and b1 is qsa b1 b1  = 1.
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pkbs. suppose c and d are wpis of b1 and b1 respectively  then the quantity of weak agreement between c and d is defined as
qwa c d  =	x 	i	 	ai.
 pi ai ¡Êc¡Èd pi1¡Êc ¡Éd and  p 1¡Êc ¡Èd   1 
when all the weights are 1  qcon c d  is the cardinality of the set of literals which are in only one of c or d.
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pbks. suppose c and d are the sets of wpis of b1 and b1 respectively  then the quantity of weak agreement between b1 and b1 is defined as
	qwa b1 b1  = max{qwa c d |c¡Êc  d¡Êd}.	 1 
the quantity of weak agreement between b1 and b1 measures the information supported by only one knowledge base and unknown to the other.
example 1  continue example 1  by equation 1  we have qwa c1 d1  = 1  qwa c1 d1  = 1  and qwa c1 d1  = 1  qwa c1 d1  = 1. therefore  the quantity of weak agreement between b1 and b1 is qwa b1 b1  = 1.
¡¡the function qwa is not monotonic with regard to the subset relation  as shown below
example 1 let b1 = { p 1 } and b1 = { q 1 }  then qwa b1 b1  = 1. however  the quantity of weak agreement between b1 = { p 1   p ¡ú  q 1 } and b1 is qwa b1 b1  = 1  where b1 b1.
¡¡based on the quantity of conflict and quantities of agreement  we can define the following relationships between two knowledge bases b1 and b1 as
  b1 and b1 are said to be totally in conflict iff qc b1 b1    1 and qsa b1 b1  =
qwa b1 b1  = 1.
  b1 and b1 are totally in agreement iff qcon b1 b1  = qwa b1 b1  = 1 and qsa b1 b1    1.
  b1 and b1 are partially in conflict iff qcon b1 b1    1 and qsa b1 b1  + qwa b1 b1    1.
1 degree of conflict and degrees of agreement
in this subsection  we will define a degree of conflict and two degrees of agreement between two pkbs. the degree of conflict measures the extent to which two knowledge bases are in conflict. it was first introduced in  hunter  1  to measure the believability of arguments.
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two self-consistent knowledge bases  and dalal b1 b1  be the dalal distance between b1 and b1. the degree of conflict between b1 and b1  denoted as c b1 b1   is defined as follows:
	c b1 b1  = dalal b1 b1 	 1 
log1 |i b1¡Èb1 |
although this definition gives a method to measure the degree of conflict  it can sometimes overestimate the degree of conflict between two knowledge bases  because it doesn't distinguish the influences of strong agreement and weak agreement. for example  let us consider two pairs of knowledge bases  b1 b1  and  b1  b1   where b1 = {p q r}  b1 = { p q r} and b1 = {p}. although the quantity of conflict between b1 and b1 is 1  the quantity of strongly agreement between them is 1. this means b1 and b1 have more in agreement than in conflict. in contrast  although the quantity of conflict between b1 and b1 is also 1  but with dsa b1  b1  = 1 and dwa b1  b1  = 1  the degree of conflict between b1 and b1 should be higher than that between b1 and b1. however  by equation 1  c b1 b1  = c b1  b1  = 1. this is not reasonable.
¡¡we propose the following revised definition of the degree of conflict.
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pkbs. let c and d be wpis of b1 and b1 respectively. atomc c d  denotes the cardinality of the set of atoms which are in conflict in c¡Èd. then the degree of conflict between c and d is defined as
dcon c d  =	qcon c d 	 
atomc c d  + qsa c d  + ¦Ëqwa c d 
 1 
where ¦Ë ¡Ê  1  is used to weaken the influence of the quantity of weak agreement on the degree of conflict. in the following  we always assume that ¦Ë = 1  that is  the quantity of weak agreement only has  half  as much the influence on the degree of conflict as the quantity of strong agreement.
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pkbs. suppose c and d are the sets of wpis of b1 and b1 respectively  then the degree of conflict between b1 and b1 is defined as
	dcon b1 b1  = min{dcon c d |c¡Êc  d¡Êd}.	 1 
¡¡the advantage of our degree of conflict can be seen from the following example.
example 1 let us consider a dialogue between three people john  mary  and gary. they are discussing  whether italy is the best football team in the world   p  and  whether the best forwards are in brazil   q . john says  i think italy is the best football team in the world and the best forwards are in brazil   mary says  no  i think france is the best team  but i agree with you that the best forwards are in brazil   and gary says  no  i think france is the best team . so the knowledge bases are john = {p q}  mary = { p q} and gary = { p}. by equation 1  we have c john mary  = c john gary  = 1. this is not reasonable  because john and mary agree on q  the degree of conflict between them should be less than the degree of conflict between john and gary. in contrast  we have dc john mary  = 1 and dcon john gary  = 1  so dc john mary    dc john gary .
proposition 1 let b1  b1 be two classical knowledge bases. suppose c b1 b1  and dcon b1 b1  are the degrees of conflict defined by definition 1 and definition 1 respectively. then c b1 b1 ¡Ýdcon b1 b1 .
¡¡similarly  we can define the degree of strong agreement. we hold that the influence of the quantity of conflict on the degree of strong agreement is more than that of the quantity of weak agreement.
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pkbs. let c and d be wpis of b1 and b1 respectively. atomsa c d  denotes the cardinality of the set of atoms which are included in both c and d. then the degree of strong agreement between c and d is defined as
dsa c d  =	qsa c d 	 
atomsa c d  + qcon c d  + ¦Ëqwa c d 
 1 
where ¦Ë ¡Ê  1  is used to weaken the influence of the quantity of weak agreement on the degree of conflict. as in definition 1  we usually take ¦Ë = 1.
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pkbs. suppose c and d are the sets of weighted prime implicants of b1 and b1 respectively  then the degree of strong agreement between b1 and b1 is defined as
   dsa b1 b1  = max{dsa c d |c¡Êc  d¡Êd}.  1  example 1 let b1 = { p 1   q ¡Å r 1   p ¡ú s 1 } and b1 = { p ¡Å  r 1   q 1    s 1 }. the wpis of b1 are c1 = { p 1   q 1   s 1 } and c1 = { p 1   r 1    s 1 }  and the wpis of b1 are d1 = { p 1   q 1    s 1 } and d1 = {  r 1   q 1    s 1 }. so dsa c1 d1  = 1  dsa c1 d1  = 1  dsa c1 d1  = 1  dsa c1 d1  = 1. therefore  dsa b1 b1  = 1.
¡¡the degrees of conflict and strong agreement are related to each other.
proposition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pkbs. then their degree of conflict and degree of strong agreement cannot be greater than 1 at the same time  i.e.  if dcon b1 b1    1  then dsa b1 b1 ¡Ü1.
we can also define the degree of weak agreement.
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pkbs. let c and d be wpis of b1 and b1 respectively. atomwa c d  denotes the cardinality of the set of atoms which are included in only one of c and d but not both. then the degree of weak agreement between c and d is defined as
dwa c d  =	qwa c d 	 
atomwa c d  + qcon c d  + qsa c d 
 1 
in definition 1  the quantity of conflict and quantity of strong agreement have the same influence on the degree of weak agreement. when both b1 and b1 are classical knowledge bases  we have dwa c d  = .
definition 1 let b1 and b1 be two pkbs. suppose c and d are the sets of wpis of b1 and b1 respectively  then the degree of weak agreement between b1 and b1 is defined as
	dwa b1 b1  = max{dwa c d |c¡Êc  d¡Êd}.	 1 
example 1  continue example 1  by definition 1  we have dwa c1 d1  = 1  dwa c1 d1  = 1  dwa c1 d1  = 1  dwa c1 d1  = 1. so the degree of weak agreement between b1 and b1 is 1.
proposition 1 let b1 and b1 be two possibilistic knowledge bases. if dwa b1 b1    1  then dcon b1 b1    1 and dsa b1 b1    1.
proposition 1 shows that if the degree of weak agreement between two knowledge bases is large  i.e.  greater than 1  then both the degree of conflict and degree of strong agreement between them should be small  i.e.  less than 1.
1 impact of measures of conflict and agreement
1 choice of combination operators
many operators have been proposed for merging pkbs. given two pkbs b1 and b1 with possibility distributions ¦Ðb1 and ¦Ðb1 respectively  the semantic results of their combination by a t-norm tn and a t-conorm ct are
	 ¦Ø  ¦Ðtn ¦Ø  = tn ¦Ðb1 ¦Ø  ¦Ðb1 ¦Ø   	 1 
	 ¦Ø  ¦Ðct ¦Ø  = ct ¦Ðb1 ¦Ø  ¦Ðb1 ¦Ø  .	 1 
the syntactic results associated with ¦Ðtn and ¦Ðct are respectively the following pkbs  benferhat et al.  1 :
btn	=	b1 ¡È b1 ¡È { ¦Õi ¡Å ¦×j  ct ¦Ái ¦Âj  | ¦Õi  ¦Ái  ¡Ê b1 and  ¦×j  ¦Âj  ¡Ê b1} 	 1 
	bct	=	{ ¦Õi ¡Å ¦×j  tn ¦Ái  ¦Âj  | ¦Õi  ¦Ái  ¡Ê b1
	and  ¦×j  ¦Âj  ¡Ê b1}.	 1 
if we require that the result of the combination be a consistent knowledge base  then the t-norm based operator cannot be used when there is a conflict between b1 and b1. in this case  we can only use a t-conorm based operator.
¡¡typical t-norm operators are the minimum operator  the product operator and the  ukasiewicz t-norm  tn  for short   max 1 a + b   1  . the duality relation respectively yields the following t-conorm: the maximum operator  the probabilistic sum  ctps for short   a+b ab   and the bounded sum  ctbs for short   min 1 a + b  .
¡¡although some criteria to choose between merging operators have been given in  benferhat et al.  1; 1   these criteria are not enough.
¡¡suppose two pkbs b1 and b1 are consistent  then the degree of conflict between them must be 1 and at least one of the degrees of agreement is greater than 1. if the degree of strong agreement between b1 and b1 is very high  then b1 and b1 share beliefs on most of the topics. in this case  it is advisable to combine them using an operator with higher reinforcement effect  for example  the  ukasiewicz t-norm max 1 a+b-1 . however  if the degree of strong agreement between b1 and b1 is low and the degree of weak agreement between them is very high  it is advisable to combine them using the minimum operator which does not have any reinforcement effect.
¡¡suppose b1 and b1 are in conflict  we usually use a tconorm to combine them. when the degree of conflict between b1 and b1 is very high  then b1 and b1 have mostly different beliefs and we can choose the  bounded sum  operator which has a high counteract effect. on the other hand  if the degree of conflict between b1 and b1 is very low  we can choose the maximum which does not have any counteract effect.
¡¡more formally  we have the following criteria to choose between merging operators.
merging operators selection criterion: let ¨1 and ¨1 be two operators applied to merge a and b  and c and d respectively  then for all a  b¡Ê 1  
 1  ¨1 a b ¡Ü ¨1  a b  if 1   dcon a b    dcon c d   1  ¨1 a b ¡Ý ¨1  a b  if dcon a b  = 1 and dsa a b    dsa c d .
example 1 let b1 = { p 1   q ¡Å  r 1   s 1 } and b1 = { p 1   q 1   s 1 }  where
dcon b1 b1  = 1 and dsa b1 b1  = 1. the merging operator here should be the product operator  and the result of merging is b =
{ p 1   q¡Å r 1   s 1   p 1   q 1   s 1   p 
1   p¡Åq 1   p¡Ås 1   p¡Åq¡Å r 1   q¡Å r 1    q¡Å r¡Ås 1   p¡Ås 1   q¡Ås 1   s 1 }. however  if we use a lukasiewicz t-norm  the result of merging is b1 = {{ p 1   q¡Å r 1   s 1   p 1   q 1    s 1   p 1   p¡Åq 1   p¡Ås 1   p¡Åq¡Å r 1   q¡Å r 1    q¡Å r¡Ås 1   p¡Ås 1   q¡Ås 1   s 1 }}. in b1  the weights of formulae p and s are reinforced to 1. however  the certainty degrees of p and s are not high in both b1 and b1. moreover  b1 and b1 are not in strong agreement with each other because dsa b1 b1  = 1. so it is not reasonable to increase the weights of p and s to the highest certainty degree 1. in contrast  in b  p and s have certainty degrees of 1 and 1 respectively. therefore the result of the product operator reflects the reinforcement of b1 and b1 more accurately than that of the lukasiewicz t-norm.
1 ordering sources
in this section  we define an ordering relation to compare different knowledge bases based on the degree of conflict.
definition 1 let bi  bj  b be three pkbs. a closeness relation 1b with regard to b is defined as.
bi1bbj iff dcon bj b ¡Üdcon bi b 
bj is closer to b than bi to b  bi1bbj  iff bj has less quantity of conflict and more quantities of agreement with b than bi. if bi1bbj  then we may view bj is less problematic or more reliable than bi with regard to b.
example 1 let b1 = {  p 1    q 1    r ¡Å s 1 }  b1 = {  p 1    q 1    r 1   s 1 }  and b = { p¡Åq 1    s ¡Å r 1 }. since dcon b1 b  = 1   1 = dcon b1 b   so b1bb1.
1 conclusion
the main contribution of this work is that we not only measure the conflict between two prioritized knowledge bases but also measure their agreement in two ways. we defined the quantity of conflict and two quantities of agreement. the quantity of conflict is a generalization of the dalal distance. we then defined the degree of conflict and degrees of agreement based on both the quantity of conflict and the quantities of agreement. we have shown that the definition of degree of conflict is more reasonable than that defined in  hunter  1 . the measures of conflict and agreement can be very useful in many applications  such as belief merging  argumentation and heterogeneous source integration and management. another potential application of the measures of conflict is to belief revision as we have shown that the quantity of conflict generalizes the dalal distance.
¡¡we didn't touch the computational issue in this paper. it is clear that the computations of measures of conflict and agreement defined in section 1 and 1 depend on the computation of wpis. it has been shown in  bittencourt et al.  1  that the computation of the set of prime implicants of a formula represented by conjunctive normal form is npcomplete using a transformation algorithm in  bittencourt et al.  1 . given a pkb b = { ¦Õ1 a1  ...  ¦Õn an } where ¦Õi are clauses  it is expected that the computation of all the wpis of b is also np-complete by generalizing the transformation algorithm. this problem will be discussed in a future paper.
