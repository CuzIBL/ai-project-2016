introduction 
       this paper gives an overview of the approach being taken to l e a r n i n g w i t h i n a c o n t i n u i n g research p r o j e c t . the p r o j e c t is concerned w i t h developing an o p e r a t i o n a l computer based model of l e a r n i n g   drawing on a psychological theory of c a t e g o r i z a t i o n proposed by rosch et a l .  rosch e t a l   1 . 
       the type of l e a r n i n g t h a t has a t t r a c t e d most a t t e n t i o n i n the a . i . l i t e r a t u r e i s the l e a r n i n g of p r o p o s i t i o n a l r u l e s about a given feature set to d i s c r i m i n a t e between categories  michalski et a l   1 . 
       but the most d i f f i c u l t part of the work has already been accomplished when the relevant features f o r r u l e formation have been found. f u r t h e r   these systems only deal e f f i c i e n t l y w i t h concepts n a t u r a l l y described in terms of conjunct i v e features and do not respond k i n d l y to ' n o i s y 1 data. 
       following from t h i s we f e e l 	it 	is necessary to develop a model of l e a r n i n g which addresses not only the questions of how to d i s c r i m i n a t e between categories using a given f e a t u r e set but also the question of how such features are found. 	e f f i c i e n t l e a r n i n g algorithms w i l l depend upon the knowledge r e p r e s e n t a t i o n scheme upon which they operate: l e a r n i n g of l o g i c a l r u l e s f i t s n a t u r a l l y w i t h a p r o p o s i t i o n a l knowledge base but not so w e l l w i t h an a s s o c i a t i v e network knowledge base. 	we t h e r e * f o r e decided to model the e n t i r e c a t e g o r i z a t i o n process of knowledge r e p r e s e n t a t i o n   	f e a t u r e 
s e l e c t i o n and d i s c r i m i n a t i o n as one i n t e g r a t e d system. 	because l e a r n i n g of categories influences the s t r u c t u r e of knowledge in memory and t h i s s t r u c t u r e 	i n t u r n a f f e c t s higher l e v e l s o f learning operating on i t   	studying c a t e g o r i z a t i o n and r e l a t e d representations also has 	i m p l i c a t i o n s f o r 
the operation of other types of l e a r n i n g . the development of a model f o r such an i n t e g r a t e d system is a complex task and so a r e s t r i c t e d domain of c l a s s i f i c a t i o n was chosen f o r t h i s work. this is the domain of 1-d s i l h o u e t t e s of v i s u a l o b j e c t s . reasons f o r t h i s choice are the primacy of v i s u a l perception in humans and the importance of r e c o g n i t i o n . a more d e t a i l e d discussion of t h i s approach are a v a i l a b l e in 
 phelps & musgrove  1a . 
knowledge representation 
       some psychological evidence is a v a i l a b l e about the s t r u c t u r e of c a t e g o r i e s . it has been argued that the most c o g n i t i v e l y e f f i c i e n t and t h e r e f o r e most basic l e v e l of c a t e g o r i z a t i o n is that l e v e l at which the categories produced provide the most d i s t i n c t c l u s t e r s   i . e . the l e v e l which maximizes the s i m i l a r i t y of objects w i t h i n a category and maximises the d i f f e r e n c e s between objects i n d i f f e r e n t c a t e g o r i e s .  rosch e t a l   1  and  tversky and hemingway  1  provide evidence t h a t t h i s basic l e v e l of c a t e g o r i z a t i o n is the most abstract l e v e l at which instances have s i m i l a r shapes and parts and it is most abstract l e v e l at which a mental image  prototype  can r e f l e c t the appearance of the e n t i r e category. 
       the knowledge r e p r e s e n t a t i o n scheme adopted f o r objects and categories has been e x p l i c i t l y designed to f i t in w i t h the prototype t h e o r y   and 
is explained in greater d e t a i l in  phelps & musgrove  1b . marr's research in machine v i s i o n has taken the view that objects are most n a t u r a l l y segmented i n t o convex parts  marr 1  and we have followed t h i s l i n e of thought but r e f i n e d it so t h a t p a r t s need only be 'psuedoconvex f in the sense t h a t f u r t h e r d i v i d i n g them i n t o more convex subparts does not s i g n i f i c a n t l y increase the measure of convexity. this approach is reported elsewhere in more d e t a i l  phelps & musgrove  in p r e p a r a t i o n   . 
       the d e s c r i p t i o n of the v i s u a l image is achieved in stages. f i r s t l y   the image is described h o l i s t i c a l l y by a set of d e s c r i p t o r s i n c l u d i n g such measures as p r i n c i p a l a x i s   axis extension r a t i o   compactness   p e r i m e t e r / a r e a     s i z e   e t c .   a p p l i e d to the whole image  barrow & popplestone  1 . the precise set of d e s c r i p t o r s used is unimportant as long as it contains a rough d e s c r i p t i o n of the shape. only a rough d e s c r i p t i o n is necessary as more accurate descriptions are provided by successive stages. at the 
second stage the image is decomposed into its primary subparts. each subpart is now described by a set of descriptors  and the 'joins' between subparts are also stored. this process is now re-
peated to any desired number of stages  the subparts being successively divided and described in 
increasing detail. 
establishing categories 
　　　features are extracted from the representational descriptions and used to measure similarities between the representations. these similarity measures position objects in a representational space wherein the objects are examined for the existence of clusters. clustering of this type is only sensibly considered if the objects under consideration are a l l roughly of the same type. thus a cow and a horse both have bodies  necks  heads and four legs and so a similarity rating is concievable. however  cow and a tomato are so different that to attempt to devise a similarity measure is pointless. hence there is an i n i t i a l need to determine which of a set of objects may possibly cluster together and which are definitely in 
separate categories. 
　　　the hierarchical description of objects gives the possibility of extracting features at different levels of detail. the f i r s t features to be considered are those at the holistic level. these w i l l often by themselves be sufficient to rule out two objects from membership of the same category  
because of an extreme difference in one or more of the measures. 	at this stage we only sort out obviously unlike objects: 	we do not wish to regard a man with arms raised as totally different from a man with his arms at his sides  but he should be differentiated from a bus. 
　　　the next stage of the categorization process is the identification of potential category member ship at the level of part descriptions. 	this stage operates separately on each set of objects identified as a potential category at the previous stage. 
　　　we allow objects a and b to be potential members of the same category if we can find a subset of parts of a and a subset of parts of b 
which match and which account for most of the area of images a and b. when such matched subsets are found  any contiguous set of parts not in the subset is fused into one 'lumped1 part. it may then be possible to match lumped parts of a and b   in which case these matched lumped parts are added to the matched subsets. 
　　　if potential categories have been identified then an attempt is made to discover actual categories within each potential set by means of cluster analysis. 
　　　each object may be represented  in part subset form  as a point in a representational space 
 where p♀j is 
the result of a measure j applied to part i and r i is the relationship between parts i and j . a clustering algorithm has been developed which w i l l seek any convex clusters present among 
r. phelps and p. musgrove 1 
these points. in particular this algorithm allows clusters to intersect  thus allowing for the fact that some natural categories may not have sharp dividing lines between them. further  it does not require the number of clusters present to be set nor does it require the alteration of parameters to give good results on different data sets. in these ways it represents an advance in automatic cluster detection over other existing algorithms. details of this method  which is designed to emulate human performance in detecting dot clusters  are described elsewhere  phelps  1 . this algorithm is used to explore the cluster structures found using different subsets of the part and relationship measures as the axes of the space. the objective is to find a minimal set of these measures which provides a 'good' cluster structure. 
　　　if the object vectors display clustering then in most cases this w i l l be due at least in part to the different clusters displaying differences in their parts. thus the search for object clusters can in fact be largely carried out by searching for clusters within corresponding parts of the objects   p i i . . . p i n   . 
　　　if at least one cluster is found  the objects within it are members of the same category. the outcome of the process at this or further stages of processing is a partitioning of the object set into  possibly overlapping  classes  each containing category members or candidates for membership of a category. however  the category structure information we seek is only contained in 
clusters of objects found via the clustering a l gorithm. 	it is the set of measures used to find each cluster and the position of the cluster within this space which provide the operational notion of categories. 	objects in a class where no cluster has been found or which have been classified as 'noise' points are uncategorized at this stage. 
　　　the above stage of processing can be repeated on the next level of the description hierarchy  'parts of parts'  and again repeated at more detailed levels u n t i l the description hierarchy ends. 
illustrative analysis 
　　　as an example of the scheme outlined above  consider a set of four silhouettes: two horses  a cow and a bird  wings closed . these have been broken down into their primary convex parts  but these do not necessarily correspond to the parts 
which we normally consider these animals to have. for example  one leg may occlude another  so in the cow the two front legs are considered as one convex part. in the horses  the area at which the two legs merge into the body and into each other ha1 been separated out as a convex part. the back legs and t a i l of the cow have merged and been split into three convex regions. the labels given to the regions are for illustrative purposes only - it is not known to the algorithm at this stage that the regions of the two horses here labelled 'body' both correspond to the same part 

1 	r. phelps and p. musgrove 
of che concept 'horse'. 	 table 1 . 
　　　the bird may be immediately differentiated from the others because of the great difference in the number of parts found. 	the cow and horses cannot be immediately distinguished and so an i n i t i a l attempt must be made to match their part 
descriptions. the best match of corresponding subsets can be made by matching the largest parts  bodies   the next largest  heads  and one of the next largest  necks   which triples preserve roughly the same relationships between their parts and account for around 1 of their areas. with these subsets matched the front junctions and legs of a 
horse are contiguous and would be treated as one lumped part  as would the rear junctions and legs. similarly  the front legs and hooves of the cow would be lumped as would the 1 rear leg parts and hooves. 
　　　the three matched parts are now considered individually to look for clustering within each 
part. for the bodies  the major difference is in area between cow and horses  which might form a 
clustering characteristic with a larger sample. there is l i t t l e evidence of clustering from the head measures. for the necks there is evidence of higher compactness  lower elongation and higher area measures for the horses which again might form clustering characteristics. the triples would now be examined in a space with axes chosen from body area  neck compactness  neck elongation  neck area plus interpart relations  such as direction between part centres. 
　　　in fact for these three animals  using the above four part measures  there is a clear i n d i cation of difference between the horses and the cow indicating a probable cluster structure. 
　　　average values of the objects in each cluster go to form prototypes. in this case the prototypical horse silhouette would consist of the simp l i f i e d representation: body  neck  frontlegs  hindlegs  t a i l   together with their average measures and relations. 


the 1 rows give measures of 1  compactness  
1  elongation 1  p r o p o r t i o n a l area in each case. 
conclusions 
this is an  extremely b r i e f   o u t l i n e of the approach we are taking to machine l e a r n i n g . a l though i t i s presently l i m i t e d t o simple v i s u a l c a t e g o r i z a t i o n it is hoped that by studying l e a r n i n g at t h i s fundamental l e v e l we w i l l provide a foundation f o r models of higher l e v e l l e a r n i n g   and t h a t p r i n c i p l e s of organizations that emerge 
in c a t e g o r i z a t i o n w i l l also be incorporated t h e r e .
