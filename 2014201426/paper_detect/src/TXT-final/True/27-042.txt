 
this paper is concerned with an inferential approach to information extraction reporting in particular on the results of an empirical study that was performed to validate the approach the study brings together two lines of research  1  the rho framework for tractable terminological knowledge representation and  1  the alembic message understanding system there are correspondingly two principal aspects of interest to this work from the knowledge representation perspective the present study serves to validate experimentally a normal form hypothesis that guarantees tractability of inference in the rho framework from the message processing perspective this study substantiates the utility of limited inference to information extraction 
1 some background 
the broad focus of this work has been an attempi to exploit tractable inference in a complex and realistic natural language processing task the task in question is information extraction  that is the process of populating a fixed-field database with information extracted from free-form natural language text the computational framework in which we have explored this research has been the alembic messageunderstanding system  aberdeen et al  1  as with many such systems the extraction process in alembic occurs through pattern matching against the semantic representation of sentences these representations are themselves derived from parsing the input text 
　that this kind of approach can yield high performance in data extraction is amply documented in  sundheim  1  we have found-as have others-that good results can be obtained with only sketchy sentence semantics  as can happen when there are gaps in the lexicon s semantic assignments  in addition  when the parser normalizes such semantic phenomena as argument passing the number of extraction patterns can be relatively small 
　strict semantic pattern-matching is unattractive  however  in cases that presume some degree of inference consider the following example of what one might term an east-west 
joint venture  our examples here are either derived or closely inspired from a standard extraction task from the fifth message understanding conference  that of identifying business partnerships and joint ventures in newswire text

    samsung signed an agreement with soyuz  the externa -trade organization of the soviet union to swap korean tv s and vcr s for pig iron     
　what makes this sentence an example of the given concept is an accumulation of small inferences that soyuz is a soviet entity that signing an agreement designates agreement between the signing parties and that the resulting agreement holds between a soviet and non-soviet entity such examples suggest that it is far preferable to approach the extraction problem through a set of small inferences rather than through some monolithic extraction pattern this notion has been embodied in a number of earlier approaches  e g  jacobs  1  or  stallard 1  
　the inferential approach we were interested in bringing to bear on this problem is the rho framework rho is a terminological classification framework that ultimately descends from kl one unlike most recent such systems  however rho focuses on terminological inference  rather than subsumption  and whereas most kl one descendants sacrifice completeness for computational tractability inference in rho is complete in polynomial time if terminological axioms meet a normal form criterion 
　the primary focus of this paper is thus to show how we applied this idiosyncratic approach to inference to the twin problems of semantic interpretation and data extraction 
　the second focus of this paper is to present a closelyrelated empirical study that was actually performed prior to the implementation of inferential data extraction in alembic we undertook this paper study pnor to implementation so as to venfy that the framework could be expected to live up to the data extraction task in particular  we were keen to ensure that the theoretical critenon that guarantees rho polynomial time completeness was actually met in practice 
　giving away the punch line  these findings were encouraging beyond our most optimistic expectations bringing an implementauon of rho to bear in a running and externally evaluated version of aumbic further substantiated these findings and we also report briefly on these experiences 
　finally the tractability cntenon having survived both the analytic scrutiny of our paper study and the practical scrutiny of implementation  we were led to speculate whether this inferential approach to natural language semantics might somehow be correct at some deep level we conclude the paper with some tantalizing suggestions that this might in fact be precisely the case

had to make a number of assumptions about what could be expected out of alembic s parsing and semantic composition components in so doing we took great pain not to require superhuman performance on the part of the parser  and restricted our expected syntactic coverage to phenomena that we felt were well within the state of die art  and that subsequendy were implemented in the running system 
　in particular  we did not require spanning parses of a sentence as with similar systems alembic uses a fragment parser that produces partial syntactic analyses when its grammar fails to derive s in addition  we exploited alembic s hierarchy of syntactic categories and postulated a number of relatively fine-grained categories thai were not currently in the system this allowed us for example to assume we could obtain the intended parse of  irish soviet airline on the basis of the pre-modifiers being both adjectives of geographic ongin  and hence co-ordinable  
　we also exploited the fact that the alembic grammar is highly lexicahzed  being based on the combinatorial calegonal framework  this allowed us to postulate some fauly detailed subcategonzation frames for verbs and their nominalizations as is currently the case with our system  we assumed that verbs and their nominalizations are canomcalized to identical semantic representations we also assumed basic competence at argument parsing  a 
characteristic already in place in the system 
1 	the validation corpus 
with these assumptions in mind we assembled a corpus of data extraction inference problems in the area of soviet economics the corpus consisted of text passages that had been previously identified for an evaluation of information retrieval techniques in this subject area the texts were drawn from over 1 wall street journal articles from 1 that were released through the acl dci these articles were filtered  by extensive use of grep  to a subset of 1-odd articles mentioning the then-exlant soviet union these articles were read in detail lo locate all passages on a set of three pre-determined economic topics 
  east-west joint ventures these being any business arrangements between soviet and non-soviet agents 
  hard currency being any discussion of attempts lo introduce a convertible unit of monetary value in die former ussr 
  private cooperatives i e employee-owned enter pnses within the ussr 
　we found 1 such passages in 1 separate articles  l 1% of the initial set of articles under consideration  
　among these 1 passages were eliminated as they were just textual mentions of the target concepts  e g the string  joint venture'  or of some simple variant these passages could easily be identified by boolean keyword search-not a particularly insightful validation of a complex nl-based process' unfortunately this removed all instances of private cooperatives from the corpus  because in these texts  the word ' cooperative  is a perfect predictor of the concept an additional four passages were also removed dunng a cross-rater reliability verification these were all amplifications of an earlier instance of one of the target concepts

     1 dings eg  us and soviet officials hailed the joint project these passages were eliminated because the corpus collectors had differing intuitions as to whether they were sufficient indications in and of themselves of the target concepts or were somehow pragmatically parasitic upon earlier instances of the target concept the remaining 1 passages required some degree of terminological inference  and formed the corpus for this study 
1 findings 
we then set about writing a collection of terminological axioms to handle this corpus we honestly expected that the resulting axioms would not all meet the tractability criterion natural language is notoriously complex  and even such classic simple kl one concepts as brachman s arch  brachman and schmolze  1 do not meet the criterion 
　what we found took us by surprise we came across many examples that were challenging at various levels complex syntactic phenomena  nightmares of reference resolution  and the ilk however  once the corpus passages were mapped to their corresponding interpretations the terminological axioms necessary to perform data extraction from these interpretations all met the criterion 
　table l above  summarizes these findings to cover our corpus of 1 passages  we required between two and three dozen sufficiency rules  depending upon how one encoded certain economic concepts and depending on what assumptions one made about argument-passing in syntax we settled on a working set of thirty such rules 
　note that this inventory does not include any necessity rules we ignored necessity rules for die present purposes in pan because they only encode inheritance relationships the size of their inventory thus only reflects the degree to which one chooses to model intermediate levels of the domain hierarchy for this study we could arguably have used none in addition necessity rules are guaranteed lo meet the tractability criterion and were consequently of only secondary interest to our present objectives 
　because this validation corpus turned out lo be fairly small me conclusions to be drawn from it could only be considered somewhat preliminary nevertheless we were very much encouraged by the relative ease with which we were able to write rules that met the tractability cnienon we just didn t seem to find any counterexamples in this data extraction task the fact that the task was both non-trivial and independently motivated was particularly encouraging 
　this approach to semantic inference and data extraction was also applied in the version of alembic that we fielded for the fifth message understanding conference as noted the domain in this case was a far more complex model of joint ventures requiring identification of all companies involved in some joint activity their corporate officers  if 
1 
　
　consider for example 'a man who owns a cat and who owns a dog which propositionalizes as 
mentioned  the geographic locations of the companies  the 
　
product of the activity  and more-much more 
　once again  we found to our pleasure that the inference rules required to cover this expanded task all met the tractability criterion in this particular case  we ended up with a set of 1 rules with coverage breaking down as follows 
  linguistic phenomena  1 rules   covering collocations argument passing and certain contractions 
general knowledge and inference  1 rules  for instance geography or time 
domain specific inference  1 rules  covering the particulars of the domain 
　in both our paper study and our muc 1 system the rules we ended up writing were largely pedestrian even bonng most rules have three terms two unary predicates and a relation linking them predicate valence is never greater than three and only a handful of axioms yield dependency trees more exotic wan a simple linear sequence of variables 
1 some speculations 
both our paper study and our experience with muc 1 can be taken as empirical indications that the tractability criterion in rho is indeed a realistic restriction it is our belief that tractable non trivial inference is thus a practical reality  even in applications as complex as data extraction systems buoyed as we were by these results we began to question whether they might not be due to some general character istics of language in fact this seems to be tantalizingly so 
　in particular the intractable class of axioms is closely implicated with anaphora resolution one of the classic hard problems in natural language processing to be specific  axioms that violate the tractability en tenon can only be satisfied by sentences that display some kind of anaphora such as pronouns or definite
