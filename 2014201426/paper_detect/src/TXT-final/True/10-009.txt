	i 	introduction 
       to understand the sentences in a discourse  a computer system  like a person  must have knowledge about the domain of the discourse. however  the knowledge required to understand even simple  reall i f e domains is so extensive that it will overwhelm a system that does not apply it selectively. this means that the a b i l i t y to focus on the subset of knowledge relevant to a particular situation is crucial. this paper addresses the problem of focus from the perspective of building a computer system that can participate in a task-oriented dialog. a representation for focus is presented; its use is illustrated by showing how the referents of definite noun phrases are identified. 
　　　a combination of contextual factors influences the interpretation of an utterance. in fact  what is usually meant by  the context of an utterance  is precisely that set of constraints which together direct attention to the concepts of interest in the discourse in which the utterance occurs. both the preceding discourse context -＊- the utterances that have already occurred - and the situational context - the environment in which an utterance occurs - affect the interpretation of the utterance. for a dialog  the situational context includes the physical environment  the social setting  and the relationship between the participants in the dialog. this paper shows how the task and dialog contexts combine to provide a focus on those concepts relevant to the interpretation of utterances in task-oriented dialogs.

　　　the following two dialog fragments illustrate the role of focus in interpreting utterances. 
si: the l i d is attached to the container with four 1-inch bolts. r1: where are the bolts  
s1: attach the l i d to the container. r1: where are the bolts  
in the f i r s t sequence  statement s1 explicitly points out a set of bolts that are then referred to in response r1. 	the dialog context provides the focus for understanding the phrase 	in the second sequence  no such explicit mention occurs. instead  the attaching referred to in s1 implicitly focuses on the fasteners involved. 	in a particular task context  knowledge about the process of attaching a specific l i d to a specific container focuses on a specific set of bolts 	hence  the noun phrase in r1 is unambiguous. 
a. 	requisites 	for. a fou representatuion 
　　　there are three requisite properties of focus representation. the mos t crucial is that it differentiate among the items in the knowledge base   i . e .   the encoding of that po rtion of the world the system knows about  on the basis of relevance. by highlighting those items in the knowledge base that are most relevant to the current discourse  the focus representation enabl es the system to access more important informat ion f i r s t during its retrieval and deduction operat ions. 
　　　second  the focus representation must account for implicitly focused items specific mention of 
an object brings into focus not only the object i t s e l f   but also certain associated items. for example  mention of  the house  brings into focus such associated objects as  the living room    the roof    the yard   and  the owner . parts of actions as well as objects may enter focus in this way. for example   sewing a dress  brings into focus  cutting out the skirt .

1 　　　third  the focus representation must include mechanisms for shifting focus. as successive utterances in a discourse are interpreted  the items in focus change. shifts of focus occur both gradually with time  and more abruptly with change of topic. not only the objects in focus  but also the particular way of viewing them  can change. for example  a doctor can be viewed as a member of the medical profession  or aa having a role in a family. 
b. 	overview of paper 
       the next section describes a focus r e p r e s e n t a t i o n that s a t i s f i e s these requirements. the r e p r e s e n t a t i o n was developed in the context of a system for understanding language  walker 1 . the knowledge base of t h i s system is embodied in a semantic network. in such a system  i d e n t i f y i n g a 
       network s t r u c t u r e is the analog of the human process of i d e n t i f y i n g and r e t r i e v i n g an item from memory. hence  the matching of network s t r u c t u r e s is a c r u c i a l process in i n t e r p r e t i n g utterances. a 
major use of the focus representation is to make t h i s matching process more e f f i c i e n t . once the focus representation has been described  and i t s use i l l u s t r a t e d   mechanisms for s h i f t i n g focus in t a s k - o r i e n t e d dialogs are discussed. these mechanisms are the only part of the focus representation that i s s p e c i f i c t o t a s k - o r i e n t e d d i a l o g s . f i n a l l y   a d e s c r i p t i o n is given of how the focus representation can be extended to help solve two e s s e n t i a l problems in natural language understanding: focusing on d i f f e r e n t a t t r i b u t e s of the same object under d i f f e r e n t circumstances  and f o r g e t t i n g information no longer relevant to a discourse. 
       the focus representation was implemented in the sri speech understanding system  walker  1  and used by the discourse component to resolve d e f i n i t e noun phrases. the process representation used to encode the task model  which is needed both for i m p l i c i t focusing and to guide s h i f t s of focus  is designed and c u r r e n t l y being implemented.  the speech understanding system implementation used a simpler s h i f t strategy than the one described here.  
	ii 	the 	focus representation 
       this section describes a two-part focus r e p r e s e n t a t i o n . one part corresponds to e x p l i c i t focus  the other to i m p l i c i t focus. the e x p l i c i t focus data s t r u c t u r e contains those items that are relevant to the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of an utterance because they have p a r t i c i p a t e d e x p l i c i t l y in the preceding discourse. i m p l i c i t focus consists of those items that are r e l e v a n t because they are c l o s e l y connected to items in e x p l i c i t focus. for instance  in the d i a l o g fragments given in the i n t r o d u c t i o n   both s1 and s1 r e s u l t in the l i d   the container  and the a t t a c h i n g operation being in e x p l i c i t focus. the b o l t s involved in the operation are in e x p l i c i t focus f o l l o w i n g s1  but i m p l i c i t focus f o l l o w i n g s1. 
       concepts that are i m p l i c i t l y focused are separated from those t h a t are e x p l i c i t l y focused   i . e .   they are not added to the e x p l i c i t focus data s t r u c t u r e   for two reasons. f i r s t   there are numerous i m p l i c i t l y focused items  many of which are never referenced in a d i a l o g . i n c l u d i n g these items in the e x p l i c i t focus data s t r u c t u r e would c l u t t e r i t   weakening i t s h i g h l i g h t i n g f u n c t i o n . second  references to i m p l i c i t l y focused items are considered i n d i c a t i o n s o f s h i f t s o f focus.

focus 
       the representation of e x p l i c i t focus is achieved by p a r t i t i o n i n g a semantic network. a semantic network is a d i r e c t e d graph: a set of nodes  and a set of   l a b e l l e d   d i r e c t e d   a r c s   connecting p a i r s of those nodes. networks have been used in several previous language understanding systems   e . g .   q u i l l i a n . 1; simmons  1 . conventions for the use and meaning of nodes and arcs vary. the networks described here use the conventions of hendrix  1 -nodes are used to represent   o b j e c t s     where   o b j e c t s   include such things as physical o b j e c t s   events  r e l a t i o n s h i p s   and s e t s . arcs are used only to encode those binary r e l a t i o n s h i p s t h a t do not change over time. 
       p a r t i t i o n i n g adds to the s t r u c t u r e of a semantic network by segmenting the nodes and arcs of the network i n t o u n i t s c a l l e d spaces. hendrix  1  introduced the n o t i o n of network p a r t i t i o n i n g   and described i t s use in encoding q u a n t i f i c a t i o n   a b s t r a c t i o n   and h y p o t h e t i c a l worlds. in a d d i t i o n to separating the nodes of a network i n t o spaces  p a r t i t i o n i n g provides for grouping the spaces i n t o ordered sets c a l l e d v i s t a s . vistas t y p i c a l l y are used to r e s t r i c t the network e n t i t i e s seen by procedures t h a t reference the network   i . e .   v i s t a s impose v i s i b i l i t y c o n s t r a i n t s   . when given a v i s t a   a procedure can operate as though the only nodes and arcs in the network are those contained in some space in the v i s t a . although any set of spaces may be c o l l e c t e d 
       i n t o a v i s t a   v i s t a s t y p i c a l l y are used to group spaces h i e r a r c h i c a l l y . 
       to encode focus  hendrix's n o t i o n of p a r t i t i o n i n g has been extended to allow a network to be p a r t i t i o n e d in more than one way. the nodes and arcs are separated i n t o d i f f e r e n t sets of segments for d i f f e r e n t purposes. in p a r t i c u l a r   the network is p a r t i t i o n e d to encode focus in a d d i t i o n to being p a r t i t i o n e d to encode q u a n t i f i c a t i o n . the p a r t i t i o n i n g to encode q u a n t i f i c a t i o n is r e f e r r e d to as the   l o g i c a l p a r t i t i o n i n g     and is represented by dashed l i n e s in the f i g u r e s in t h i s r e p o r t . the p a r t i t i o n i n g to encode focus is r e f e r r e d to as the  focus p a r t i t i o n i n g   and is represented by s o l i d l i n e s . the spaces in the focus p a r t i t i o n i n g are used to h i g h l i g h t items t h a t become focused in a discourse. the focus spaces are r e l a t e d in a hierarchy t h a t r e f l e c t s the s t r u c t u r e o f the discourse   t h i s i s important for s h i f t i n g focus  as w i l l be discussed l a t e r   . 
n a t u r a l language: grosz 1        an example of a p a r t i t i o n e d semantic network is displayed in figure 1. the network is d i v i d e d i n t o four spaces: so  s1  s1  and s1- the conventions adopted for f i g u r e s in t h i s paper are t h a t a node l i e s on the space s  i n s i d e of which it is drawn  and an arc l i e s on the space s  i n s i d e of which i t s l a b e l appears. if the boxes representing two spaces o v e r l a p   but n e i t h e r contains the o t h e r   then the nodes and arcs in the overlap l i e on both spaces. in figure 1  space so groups the nodes representing exchanges  the set of a l l exchange s i t u a t i o n s     attachings  bolts  pumps  and 
platforms  the sets of a l l attach operations  bolts  pumps  and platforms  respectively . space s1 contains the specific exchange  represented by the node 'ex1'  single quotes denote node names   in which one object  the set of bolts b1. repressnted by the node b1'  is exchanged for another  the amount of money represented by the node '$1 . the e arc from 'ex1 ' to 'exchanges' indicates that ex1 is an element of the set exchanges. the s arc from 'b1  to 'bolts' indicates that the set b1 is a subset of bolts. space s1 contains the representation of a specific attaching operation  a1  of the minor part  pu1  and the major part  pl1. space s1 also contains the specific attaching operation a1 but shows that this operation involves the specific set of bolts  
b1. 
　　　the hierarchy of spaces in figure 1 is shown by the heavy arrows between spaces. each space is associated with a particular vista that is the  orthodox  vista for that space. in figure 1  the orthodox vista associated with each space s is composed of the space s i t s e l f and a l l spaces that can be reached from s by following the heavy arrows. for instance  the orthodox vista of so is  so  and the orthodox vista of s1 is  s1 s1 so . 
　　　the v i s i b i l i t y constraints that result from this partitioning may be seen by considering different views of the bolts b1 and the attaching operation a1. b1 is shown as taking part in two different events. a1 is a 1ingle operation shown at two different levels of detail. from the vista  s1 so   the set of bolts b1 is seen only to be involved in the exchange ex1. however  from the vista  s1 s1 so   b1 is seen as the fasteners in the operation of attaching pu1 to pl1. the two vistas give two alternative views of b1. a similar situation occurs with a1. from the vista  s1 so   a1 is seen only as an attaching between two parts  with the fasteners l e f t unspecified. when s1 is added as the bottom space in the vista  a1 is seen to involve the specific fasteners b1. 
　　　the focus partitioning makes it possible to highlight the particular way of looking at a concept that is germane to a given point in a dialog. when the same object enters the dialog twice  in two different subdialogs  e.g.  a tool used in two distinct subtasks   the node corresponding to that object w i l l appear in two distinct focus spaces. if different aspects of the object are focused on in the two subdialogs  different relationships in which the object participates w i l l be in the two focus spaces. for example  in figure 1  b1 is focused on in s1 as a 
　　　part of an exchange. in contrast  in s1 it is focused on as part of an attaching operation. 
　　　the main reason for providing the a b i l i t y to focus on different attributes of an object is to 
allow differential access to the properties of the object  and hence to order the retrieval of derivable facts about that object. differential access is important for events and relationships as well as physical objects. for example  when quilting is considered as a kind of sewing  the subactions of cutting and pinning are accessed f i r s t   but when quilting is considered as a social gathering  the subactions of talking and eating are more important  and are selected f i r s t . 
　　　there are two principles governing what is contained in a focus space. first  if a concept is in focus  type information about that concept must also be in focus.  the type information both indicates the aspect of the concept being focused on and provides the key index to additional knowledge about the concept.  therefore  in the network representation  every node in focus must have one outgoing element or subset arc also in focus. second. if a concept's participation in some situation  e.g.  a book's being the object of a specific owning relationship  is in focus  then the situation i t s e l f   i . e .   the specific owning relationship  also must be in focus. therefore  the node from which any focused case arc emanates must also be in focus. 
　　　new focus spaces are created as the focus of a discourse shifts. at any point in a dialog  only one focus space is  active   but several may be considered  open.  the active focus space reflects the focus of attention at the current point in the dialog. the open focus spaces reflect previous active spaces that contain some unfinished topics and hence may become active again; they are areas to which the dialog may return. the relationship between focus spaces is determined by  and hence reflects  the structure of the particular discourse being processed for task dialogs  the task hierarchy provides a framework for this structure  grosz  1  discusses the structure of these dialogs . 
b. 	implicit focusing through a task representation 
　　　the representation of implicit focus requires a decision about what information associated with a concept should be put in focus when that concept is introduced. the bounds on this information depend on the knowledge and expectations about the concept that are shared by speaker and hearer  see karttunen  1; maratsos  1 . the tradeoff between how much information to associate with a given concept  and how many levels of associations to consider for implicit focusing  must be resolved. in general  these problems entail basic and complex issues about the representation of knowledge. they w i l l be addressed here only as they occur for events. 
　　　for physical objects  the subparts of the object are among the concepts that must be implicitly focused when the object is in focus. for events  the situation is somewhat more complicated. the direct analogy of subparts of an object is subevents of an event. however  the participants in the subevents of an event are also implicitly focused. the dialog sequence s1-r1 presented in the introduction illustrates this point. s1 implicitly focuses on the bolts involved in the attaching as well as the subevent of fastening the l i d down. 
　　　to enable implicit focusing on both the subevents and the participants involved in them  the representation of an event indicates both i t s

subevents and the participants in i t s subevents.

optimally  for both kinds of decision  the matcher w i l l choose the most constraining element. in an unfocused match  the choice can be made only on the basis of local structural information. 
a. 	matching in focus 
　　　the focus representation is used to order the candidates considered for binding by the matcher. the term  focused match  is used to denote matches that are constrained by focu1. focusing on certain concepts  both nodes and arcs  constrains the matcher to consider only objects germane to the dialog. since arcs provide indices from focused items into general network  kvista  information  focusing on an arc also guides the matcher in establishing properties about nodes being matched. that i s   focused arcs provide a means of differential access to unfocused information. using the arcs in focus for differential access does not eliminate consideration of a concept from a different perspective. instead  it orders the way in which aspects of the concept are to be examined in looking for new  to the dialog  information about the concept. 
　　　when a focused match is requested  the matcher is passed two arguments in addition to the usual qvista and kvista: a focus vista and a  forced-infocus  l i s t . the focus vista represents the set of nodes and arcs considered to be  in focus.  different calls on the matcher are made for explicit and implicit focus matches. for explicit focus  the focus vista may be either the active focus space alone  or the entire vista of open focus spaces. for implicit focus  the focus vista is the composite of the implicit focus vistas for a l l items in explicit focus  e.g.  for each event  the vista of plot space and binding space . the forced-in-focus l i s t contains those items in the qvista that must be bound to items in the focus vista. as an example of the use of the forced-infocus l i s t   consider the requirement that the referent of a definite noun phrase be in focus. this requirement corresponds to a focused match in which the forced-in-focus l i s t contains the qvista node corresponding to the head noun of the noun phrase. 
　　　forcing a qvista item to be in focus provides a strong constraint on the search for a matching kvista item. 	hence  forced-in-focus items are selected as the f i r s t candidates from the qvista to be matched. 	if a successful match is obtained for such an item  it constrains other items in the qvista. 	if no match can be found for a forced-infocus item  then no focused match of the qvista is possible. 
　　　the focus vista is used to order the selection of kvista items for t r i a l binding to a qvista item. each step of the matching algorithm f i r s t selects relevant items in the focus vista both for explicit matches  the item in the qvista is bound to an item 
that explicitly exists in the kvista  and for derived matches  application of a general rule produces a new kvista element . hence  focus influences the order in which deductions are made in the process of arriving at a match. 
　　　figure 1 illustrates the use of focus to reduce the number of candidates considered for binding by the matcher. consider the kvista of figure 1 and the qvista  q.wl  of figure 1. the kvista contains several wrenches: w1 is a box-end wrench that is in focus fs1; w1 is a box-end wrench in focus fs1; w1 is an open-end wrench also in focus fs1; w1 is another open-end wrench not in focus at a l l . there is another object  1  with a box-end. the qvista represents the noun phrase  the box-end wrench . in an unconstrained match  the matcher would consider a l l the nodes with e 
　　　arcs to 'wrenches'  or all of the nodes with endtype arcs to 'box-end'  depending on which set is smaller  as candidates for binding to qw1. eventually  it would try 'w1' or 'w1' and obtain a successful match. in the worst case  this would entail one node and two arc bindings for each of the candidate nodes that f a i l s as a complete match. in general  there may be many such unsuccessful candidates  e.g.  many wrenches that are not boxend wrenches  but are considered by the matcher before it selects 'w1 or 'w1' . 
　　　the focused match is able to avoid a l l this searching. if focus space fs1 is used  only nodes 'h1' and *w1' are considered. 'h1' w i l l be rejected immediately because the e arc to 'hammers' is incompatible with the e arc from 'qw1' to 'wrenches'  the matcher knows that the sets hammers and wrenches have no intersection from the ds arcs from 'wrenches' and 'hammers' to 'tools' . with focus space fs1 as the constraint  both 'w1' and 'w1' are considered  but 'w1' is eliminated because of i t s incompatible endtype. in the worst case  one set  one e arc and one node  of unnecessary bindings is made. even greater savings are obtained when deduction is necessary to achieve a match  that i s   when general rules - chunks of information stored in the net as applicable to whole sets of concepts - must be applied  see grosz  1 . in such cases  focus constrains the application of such rules  avoiding a combinatorial explosion of t r i a l bindings. 
iv shifting focus and the resolution of definite noun phrases 
　　　to complete the focus representation  it is necessary to provide a mechanism for deciding when to shift focus. a shift in focus may be stated directly by some utterance in a discourse  e.g.   i've finished that step. what's next   or  let's change the t o p i c       but usually the cues are more subtle. for example  when the discussion of some activity turns to a discussion of one of the participants in the activity  the focus shifts from the overall activity to that participant. what indicates a shift in focus depends on both the kind of discourse being processed and on the topic of discourse. the shift strategy described here is specific to task-oriented dialogs. it reflects the task as the major topic of such dialogs  and hence the major indicator of shifts of focus. although the rest of the focus representation is general  this aspect would need modification for application to other kinds of discourse.

　　　in task dialogs  a shift in focus takes place whenever a new task is entered or an old one completed. a narrowing of focus takes place whenever a subtask of the active task is opened for discussion. the focus shifts back up to the higher level task when that subtask is completed. hence  when a subtask of the current task is referenced  a new active focus space is created below the current active focus space. when the subtask is completed  the new focus space is closed and the old space   i . e .   the higher space  becomes the active focus space again. the top of the focus space hierarchy is the focus of the overall task. 
　　　a shift in focus may be cued by any part of an utterance: a noun phrase  a verb phrase  or modifying phrases. 	although an individual constituent  e.g.  a noun phrase  may indicate a shift in focus  the constituent alone cannot be used to determine the shift  because the remainder of the utterance influences the decision. 	for instance  an isolated noun phrase may seem to indicate a shift to some task but  when considered 
with its embedding verb phrase  may indicate a shift to a different task. the following discussion examines the relationship between identifying the referent of a definite noun phrase and shifting focus. grosz  1  describes the interaction of various constituents of an utterance in determining a shift. 
　　　to illustrate how a noun phrase may indicate a shift in focus  consider the task hierarchy in figure 1 and the focus environment portrayed in figure 1. figure 1 is only for the reader's benefit; this information is actually encoded in structures like those in figure 1 and figure 1. the dotted lines show the task hierarchy and the solid lines show time sequencing. suppose that task t1  installing the aftercooler  is the current task. the focus spaces fso  fs1  and fs1 in figure 1 correspond to subtasks to  t1  and t1 respectively. fs1 is the active focus space; the vista  fs1 fso  is the hierarchy of open focus spaces. 
　　　a reference to an object in either the active focus space or one of the open focus spaces does 
not cause a shift in focus. those items in the active focus space are considered f i r s t when resolving a reference because the currently active task is more in focus than i t s embedding tasks. the phrases  the aftercooler    the wrench   and  the crescent wrench  a l l refer to objects in fs1  the active focus space. hence  the use of any of these phrases does not affect the focus of attention. the referent can be retrieved immediately. the use of either  the air compressor    the pump   or  the ratchet wrench  also does not cause a change in focus. since these objects are in open focus spaces  they are also in focus  but are accessed only after considering the objects in fs1. note that the noun phrase   the wrench   is not ambiguous because of the distinction between the active focus and the open focus spaces  this distinction is evident in references occurring in actual task dialogs between two people; see grosz  1 . 
　　　references to either a new subtask  or a new parallel or higher task  or to subtasks of any of these  do change focus. in the example  space iads contains the delineation of the process for installing the aftercooler. the plot space of this delineation is the implicit focus for node 'iaci'. it shows that this kind of installation has two substeps  corresponding to t1 and tu in figure 1 . the f i r s t substep involves a connection operation between the aftercooler and one of i t s subparts  an aftercooler elbow. in this focus environment  since there is no aftercooler elbow in explicit focus  the phrase   the aftercooler elbow   indicates a possible shift in focus to task t1- if the remainder of the utterance concurs with such a shift  a new focus space w i l l be created below fs1 in the hierarchy. the utterance   attach the 
aftercooler elbow   indicates such a shift  but the utterance   the aftercooler elbow is broken   does not. 	note that a shift in focus may entail instantiating new entities or identifying real entities corresponding to hypothetical entities in implicit focus. 	if focus is shifted to task t1  the aftercooler elbow ace1 is brought into focus and the noun phrase  the aftercooler elbow  is identified with i t ; i.e.  the new focus space w i l l contain the node 'acev. 
　　　with a representation of focus  the process of identifying the referent of a noun phrase looks quite different than in systems that search sequentially back through a discourse for a referent. the important question is when and how to shift focus  not how far back   i . e .   how many sentences  to look for the referent. the search for the referent of a definite noun phrase takes into account the difference between those items which do and those which do not shift focus. items in explicit focus  which do not indicate a shift in focus  are checked before items in implicit focus  which do.

　　　this section explores the use of the focus space representation in the solution of two other problems that arise in building knowledge based systems. first  there is a space-time tradeoff between storing derived information in the knowledge base and recomputing the information. ideally  the information would be stored only as long as needed and then erased from the knowledge base. this issue is closely related to the general issue of forgetting in a knowledge based system. second  any given object may be viewed from several different perspectives. highlighting a particular view may be used to capture the information conveyed by the specific way an object is described in a given utterance.

       in the process of matching network s t r u c t u r e s   it is o f t e n necessary to deduce i n f o r m a t i o n about p a r t i c u l a r objects from general r u l e s in the knowledge base. in the process of computing a match  the matcher may create new network s t r u c t u r e . i f the network s t r u c t u r e i s permanently stored in the knowledge base  the deduction w i l l never have to be repeated. however  making the s t r u c t u r e permanent uses up valuable storage. focus spaces provide a mechanism for determining how long to store such i n f o r m a t i o n . when the new s t r u c t u r e is d e r i v e d   it can be added to the c u r r e n t focus space. when the focus space is closed  the new i n f o r m a t i o n can be erased. 
       as an example of t h i s use of focus spaces  consider the s i t u a t i o n portrayed in figure 1. the   l o g i c a l   space oew.dese represents the f a c t t h a t a l l elements of the set 1-e have endtype open-end. bew.desc represents a s i m i l a r r u l e . suppose t h a t i n i t i a l l y the nodes 'w1' and w1' were in focus as elements of the sets b-e and 1-e r e s p e c t i v e l y   e . g .   the wrenches were selected from two boxes each c o n t a i n i n g one type of wrench . if the matcher is given the s t r u c t u r e for  box-end wrench   see figure 1  to match  it w i l l create two new a r c s   an endtype arc from 'w1 ' to 'box-end'  and an e x p l i c i t e arc from 'w1' to 'wrenches'. these new arcs are added to the focu1 space  fs  as shown in figure 1. any f u r t h e r matches sought for  the boxend wrench  while the focus is fs w i l l be able to take advantage of t h i s e x p l i c i t l y stored i n f o r m a t i o n . when fs ceases to be open  the arcs w i l l be erased. if the deduction had r e s u l t e d in new nodes being created  they too could be erased. using focus spaces in t h i s way creates the double advantage of having the i n f o r m a t i o n a v a i l a b l e when it is r e l e v a n t   and a l l o w i n g it to be  garbage c o l l e c t e d   or   f o r g o t t e n   a f t e r it ceases to be r e l e v a n t .

       the r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of some concept c may include d e s c r i p t i o n s of c as an instance of several d i f f e r e n t kinds of other concepts. focusing allows the p a r t i c u l a r way of looking at c germane to a given p o i n t in a d i a l o g to be h i g h l i g h t e d   c f . the use of m u l t i p l e perspectives in bobrow and winograd  1 . the arcs from focused items to unfocused items provide the matcher w i t h 
       p r e f e r e n t i a l access to i n f o r m a t i o n that is most l i k e l y to become relevant to a discourse. 
       this use of focusing addresses one part of the  mayor of san diego  problem posed by norman et a l .  1 . consider the s i t u a t i o n portrayed i n figure 1. the person represented by the node 'mnmsd' is shown to be both d's neighbor and the mayor of san diego. if mnmsd is r e f e r r e d to by d e i t h e r as  the mayor of san diego  or  d's neighbor   then node 'mnmsd' represents the i n d i v i d u a l r e f e r r e d t o . the problem is t h a t looking only at t h a t node provides no r e f l e c t i o n of the d i f f e r e n c e s between the two references to mnmsd  even though the surface noun phrases do express t h i s d i f f e r e n c e . focus spaces provide a means of representing t h i s d i f f e r e n c e . 	even though node 'mnmsd' w i l l be in focus no matter which reference is used  arcs from 	'mnmsd' 	that are in focus in the two cases w i l l d i f f e r . 	focus spaces fs1 and fs1 i l l u s t r a t e t h i s d i f f e r e n c e .

       the focus representation groups items relevant to a p a r t i c u l a r point in a discourse  providing a small subset of the knowledge base on which the understanding system can concentrate. 	in p a r t i c u l a r   	the focus representation may be used to guide the r e t r i e v a l of information from the knowledge base. 	it reduces the size of the search space that the r e t r i e v a l mechanism must t r a v e r s e . the representation of e x p l i c i t focus in focus spaces also appears to be useful 	for r e l a t e d 
       understanding system problems  such as describing objects and f o r g e t t i n g i n f o r m a t i o n . 	although the representation presented is in terms of a semantic network  p a r t i t i o n i n g a memory representation for the purpose of r e f l e c t i n g focus of a t t e n t i o n is a general mechanism which may be used in other representation schemes as w e l l .
