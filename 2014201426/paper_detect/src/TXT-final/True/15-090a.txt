i introduction 
　　　humans quite effectively reason about other humans' knowledge states  belief states  and states of wanting. unfortunately  the processes by which humans do this are not well understood. this paper outlines an approach toward computationally investigating these processes. this approach involves two components  the first of which involves adequately representing knowledge about others' knowledge; and the second of which involves describing implementable processes by which it is possible to reason about such knowledge. our approach is fregean to the extent that the kind of cognitive system 
we propose puts emphasis upon the representation of fregean senses. however  the approach is not entire  y fregean because we do not represent denotations. this contrasts with the purely fregean 
approaches of mccarthy  1  and creary  1 . 
a. mccarthy's approach 
　　　mccarthy begins with the simple example of pat knowing mike's phone number which is incidentally the same as mary's phone number  although pat does not necessarily know this. this example immediately exposes one of the difficulties of reasoning 
about knowledge  namely  the problem of inhibiting substitution of equal terms for equal terms in referentially opaque contexts. mccarthy's approach toward solving this problem involves explicitly representing senses and denotations. 
b. creary's 	extension 
　　　creary extended mccarthy's system to handle iterated propositional attitudes. mccarthy's system fails for iterated propositional attitudes because propositions are represented but not their concepts. creary's extensions involve introducing a hierarchy of typed concepts. thus for individuals such as the person mike  this scheme would have the person mike  the concept of mike  the concept of the concept mike  and so forth. the higher concept is the fregean sense of the lower concept  which reciprocally is the denotation of the higher concept. a similar situation holds for propositions. the hierarchy would consist of a truth value  the proposition which denotes the truth value  the concept of that proposition  and so on. this scheme allows for the representation of iterated propositional attitudes because all objects in the domain of discourse  most notablv proposi-
tions  have senses. 
c. the maida-shapiro position 
　　　our starting point is the observation that knowledge representations are meant to be part of the conceptual structure of a cognitive agent  and therefore should not contain denotations. the thread of this argument goes as follows: a cognitive agent does not have direct access to the world  but only to his representations of the world. for instance  when a person perceives a physical object such as a tree  he is really apprehending his representation of the tree. hence  a knowledge representation that is meant to be a component of a  mind  should not contain 
denotations. a more elaborate statement of this position can be found in maida and shapiro  1  and the system for representing knowledge  called lambda net  described in the remainder of this paper is described in maida  1 . for our purposes  refraining from representing denotations achieves two goals: 1  the problem of substitution of equal terms for equal terms goes away because distinct terms are never equal; and 1  we can represent iterated propositional attitudes without 
invoking a hierarchy of types. 
ii l a m b d a net 
a. intensional 	individuals 
　　　there is a class of intensional individuals for which it can be said that they have a value as seen in assertions such as: 
a  john-bear knows where irving-bee i s . 
b  john knows mike's phone number. 
c  john knows the mayor's name. 

a. maida 1 
what does john know in each of 	these 	sentences  

he knows the value of 	some 	intensional 	i n d i v i d u a l . we can characterize 	these 	individuals by 	observing 	that 	they 	each 	involve 	a 	two-argument 	r e l a t i o n ; 	namely  	location-of  	phone-no-of  	and name-of  	respectively. 	in each case  	one 	argument is s p e c i f i e d ; 	namely: 	irving-bee  	mike  	and 	the 
mayor. the other argument is unspecified. we make the assumption that context uniquely determines the value of the unspecified argument. this value is the value of the intensional expression. the expressions themselves can now be represented as: 

b. knowing intensional i n d i v i d u a l s 
       since each of these expressions has a value  someone can know their values. we w i l l express this via a relation called  know-value-of  which takes a cognitive agent and an intensional i n d i -
vidual as arguments. to represent  john knows mike's phone number   we w r i t e : 
	g  	 know-value-of 	john 
	 the 	 lambda 	 x  	 phone-no-of 	mike x     
observe that we treat proposition al a t t i t u d e s   and a t t i t u d e s toward intensional i n d i v i d u a l s   as being r e l a t i o n a l and not as intensional operators. knowing is viewed as correct  but not necessarily j u s t i f i e d   belief. 
　　　the meaning of  know-value-of  entails that if john knows the value of mike's phone number  
and the value of mike's phone number is 1  then john  knows-that  the value of mike's phone number is 1. 
c. iterated 	proposltional 	attitudes 
       reasoning about the knowledge states of others necessarily involves iterated proposit i o n a l a t t i t u d e s because the cognitive agent doing the reasoning is generating beliefs about another agent's knowledge state which i t s e l f may contain beliefs about the beliefs of other cogn i t i v e agents. thus it is useful to show how lambda net represents such assertions. creary  1  offers three semantic i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s of the ambiguous sentence: 
h  pat believes that mike wants to meet jim's wife. 
he suggests that the task of representing these i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s provides a strong test of the representation. in order to allow the reader to compare the lambda net scheme with creary's we 
list 	the 	representations below. 	in each 	case  	we 
give a rendering of the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n in english  our r e p r e s e n t a t i o n   and creary's representation. 
1  pat believes that mike wants to meet jim's wife as such. 
the reader should refer to the o r i g i n a l papers  creary  1  and maida  1   to make the proper comparison. one of creary's goals is to stay 
within the confines of a f i r s t - o r d e r logic. lambda net does not have that constraint. 
d. knowing 	coreferential 	intensional 	individuals 
       to assert that two intensional i n d i v i d u a l s are coreferent  we w r i t e : 
i   equiv 	i n d i v i d u a l - 1 	l n d i v i d u a l - 1   
the r e l a t i o n  equiv  is mnemonic for extensional equivalence  and is the only reference to extens i o n a l i t y used in lambda net. one of our performance goals is to design a system which reacts appropriately to assertions of coreference. this involves specifying a method -to treat transparent 
and opaque relations a p p r o p r i a t e l y . a r e l a t i o n   or verb  such as   d a i l   or  value-of  is transparent whereas a r e l a t i o n such as  know  is opaque with respect to its complement p o s i t i o n . we can express this as: 
	 transparent 	dial  
	 transparent 	value-of  
	  c o n d i t i o n a l l y - t r a n s p a r e n t 	know 	lst-arg 	1nd-arg  
  d i a l   and  value-of  are unequivically transparent  whereas  know   either know-that or knowvalue-of  is transparent on the condition that the 1 a. maida agent doing the knowing also knows that two e n t i ties are coreferent. we can p a r t i a l l y express 
e. 	axiom of 	rationality 
       a system that reasons about the beliefs of another cognitive agent must make assumptions about the r a t i o n a l i t y of that agent in regard to 
what he considers legitimate rules of inference. we shall assume that all cognitive agents u t i l ize the same set of inference schema. this is the axiom of rationality and we further assume that this set of schema is exactly the set given in this paper. a statement of the axiom of rationa l i t y is: 
axiom of rationality - if a cognitive agent knows or is capable of deducing all of the premises of a valid inference  then he is capable of deducing the conclusion of that inference. 
the axiom of rationality enables one cognitive agent to determine by indirect simulation whether another cognitive agent is capable of inferring something. it implies   if i figured it out and he knows what 1 know  then he can also figure it out if he thinks long enough.  we w i l l assume that the s i t u a t i o n s involved in knowing about t e l -
ephone numbers are simple enough to make p l a u s i ble the stronger rule   if 1 figured out and he knows what i know  then he has d e f i n i t e l y figured it out.  
f. 	reasoning 	about 	knowing 
       in this section we give an example of how reasoning about knowing can take place in lambda net by modeling the following s i t u a t i o n involving a propositional a t t i t u d e . 
premises: 1  john knows that pat knows mike's phone number. 
1  john knows that pat knows that mike's phone number is the same as mary's phone number. 
conclusion: john knows that pat knows mary's phone number. 
by the d e f i n i t i o n of knowing as correct belief  it follows that: 1  pat knows mike's phone number; 
and  1  pat knows that mike's phone number is the same as mary's phone number. from c o n d i t i o n a l transparency and the axiom of r a t i o n a l i t y   the conclusion f o l l o w s . 
i l l summing up 
a. what has been achieved  
　　　a system which can reason v a l i d l y about knowledge must have at least the following three per-
formance c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s : 	1  	the system must be able 	to 	represent 	assertions 	involving 	iterated propositional 	a t t i t u d e s 	and 	reason 	from 	these assertions; 	1  	the 	system must react 	appropriately to 	assertions 	involving 	coreference 	between 	d i s tinct 	intensional 	i n d i v i d u a l s ; 	and  	1  	the 	system 
must f e l i c i t o u s l y represent that another cognitive agent can know the value of some intensional i n d i vidual without the system i t s e l f necessarily knowing the value. lambda net has these c h a r a c t e r i s tics just as creary's  1  does. however  lambda net offers the advantage of not invoking a hierarchy of conceptual types in order to achieve these performance c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s . 
b. current 	work 
       we are implementing this system to process speech acts using the general strategy described by allen  1 . this approach views speech acts as communications between cognitive agents about obstacles and potential solutions to achieving some goal. therefore  comprehending and appropriately reacting to a speech act necessarily requires the capacity to reason about another cognitive agent's goals  wants   planning strategy  and knowledge states.
