　　　my purpose is to present a new technique for computer d e s c r i p t i o n of textured surfaces. although i use outdoor scenes  i n v o l v i n g grass  water  f o r e s t   and the l i k e as a s t a r t i n g point of i n t u i t i o n   t e x tured surfaces generally appear in almost every sort 
of scene and  t h e r e f o r e   i w i l l also show some examples of i s o l a t e d and a r t i f i c i a l t e x t u r e s . 
       this study is motivated by a wide range of pract i c a l a p p l i c a t i o n s . the a g r i c u l t u r a l survey and anal y s i s of earth resources by means of s a t e l l i t e p i c tures is one such example. the s o c i a l b e n e f i t s of computer-controlled cars using computer v i s i o n   as described by john mccarthy  is another. i n d u s t r i a l robots w i l l soon acquire v i s i o n   too. texture synt h e s i s   to which i f e e l our techniques are also app l i c a b l e   is useful in computer-aided design and computer-aided a r t . i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of scanning e l e c t r o n microscope p i c t u r e s   e . g .   for metallurgy  may also be of i n t e r e s t . 
　　　a primary problem in texture is how we perceive a textured surface as a uniform s t r u c t u r e in a nont r i v i a l way. i n t u i t i v e l y speaking  there are many levels on which one can perceive t e x t u r e . in one s i t -
uation we may look at the p a t t e r n created on a w a l l and c a l l that a   t e x t u r e .   in another s i t u a t i o n we may have a closer look at the same w a l l from the same distance  but in t h i s case see texture of the i n d i v i d u a l b r i c k s and ignore the texture given by the o v e r a l l a r c h i t e c t u r a l s t r u c t u r e of the b r i c k s . we want to characterize textures in terms of a compact symbolic representation. 
　　　we f o l l o w a s t r u c t u r a l d e s c r i p t i o n of textured regions in terms of texture elements and t h e i r s p a t i a l r e l a t i o n s h i p s . 	in t u r n   textured regions can also be texture elements in a larger s t r u c t u r e   e t c . 
　　　texture elements cannot be determined in i s o l a t i o n . they are recognized through t h e i r s i m i l a r i t y r e l a t i o n s h i p s   although the measure of a s i m i l a r i t y 
may vary considerably. 	for example  in a texture of pebbles 	the size s i m i l a r i t y may be important even though the sizes vary s i g n i f i c a n t l y . 	s t i l l   	there is u n i f o r m i t y w i t h i n a f a c t o r of 1 or so. 	s i m i l a r i t i e s of other properties such as c o n t r a s t   shape and spat i a l d i s t r i b u t i o n s may also be only approximate.

	texture 	descriptions 
　　　the problem of texture recognition has been noted already in early computer v i s i o n research. ' ' ' ' 
       the best review paper about the current state of texture e x t r a c t i o n technology is that of hawkins. according to him  there are four types of approaches that have been taken toward texture c l a s s i f i c a t i o n : 
 1  s p a t i a l frequency content;  1  gray l e v e l content;  1  l o c a l shape content; and  1  higher order measures. a l l of these approaches are p a t t e r n c l a s s i f i c a t i o n techniques. these techniques are not s a t i s f a c t o r y for a d e s c r i p t i o n of r e a l textures for the f o l l o w i n g reasons : 
 1  p a t t e r n c l a s s i f i c a t i o n techniques have concentrated on l i n e a r decision procedures and domain independent formulations. in t h i s method the p r i n c i p l e of c o n t i n u i t y based on l o c a l s i m i l a r i t y r e l a t i o n s h i p s of some features is missing; however  in r e a l scenes this fact is very important. take  as an example  a grassy f i e l d . usually  grass appears as a l i n e a r y h o r i z o n t a l t e x t u r e   e . g .   h o r i z o n t a l p a r a l l e l l i n e s . however  
when the wind blows  some of the grass s t a l k s change d i r e c t i o n away from the h o r i z o n t a l l i n e s . although t h i s change of d i r e c t i o n a l i t y is continuous and thus 
detectable  p a t t e r n r e c o g n i t i o n methods would miss i t . 
 1  in p a t t e r n recognition approaches  context appears as a set of numerical c o e f f i c i e n t s in a l i n e a r funct i o n and in the choice of features. better models exi s t   in terms of context dependent decision t r e e s   
which provide a f l e x i b l e d e s c r i p t i o n of the object in the scene. the d e s c r i p t i o n is not a simple name of a class to which the object belongs  but rather a desc r i p t i o n of the o b j e c t ' s p a r t s   a t t r i b u t e s   and r e l a tionships ＊ 
　　　in f a c t   s t r u c t u r a l d e s c r i p t i o n of a texture is the main theme in our work. in other words  our work involves the d e s c r i p t i o n of texture elements   t h e i r shape  s i z e   o r i e n t a t i o n   e t c .   and r e l a t i o n a l f e a tures   s p a t i a l o r g a n i z a t i o n   texture g r a d i e n t   and the like . 
       in p r a c t i c a l implementations we can describe only simple r e l a t i o n s h i p s in s p a t i a l organization among the elements  e . g .   l i n e a r   b i l i n e a r   p e r i o d i c   regular but aperiodic  symmetric. likewise  shape descriptors of the elements must be r e l a t i v e l y simple   s t r a i g h t l i n e s   dots  b l o b - l i k e   . one may question the e f f e c tiveness of simple r e l a t i o n s h i p s and t h e i r d e s c r i p t o r s ; it is reasonable to think that a more complex desc r i p t i o n of texture elements and t h e i r r e l a t i o n s h i p s is necessary for adequate d e s c r i p t i o n of t e x t u r e s . however  the psychological experiments i n d i c a t e that human d i f f e r e n t i a t i o n of textures depends heavily on a few simple d e s c r i p t o r s   such as contrast and d i r e c t i o n a l i t y   and ignores even curvature in making texture groupings. although we cannot estimate the computat i o n a l complexity of d e s c r i p t o r s   we have an i n t u i t i v e f e e l i n g that in terms of time or in terms of complexi t y o f w i r i n g for p a r a l l e l systems  simple d e s c r i p t o r s   such aa d i r e c t i o n a l i t y   are c l e a r l y p r e f e r r e d . 
	procedures 	f o r texture descriptors 
　　　basically  there are two domains from which one can derive t e x t u r e d e s c r i p t o r s : the s p a t i a l and the fourier domain. yet  some features are more v i s i b l e 
in one domain than in the other. for example  the local properties  buch as the shape of a texture element  are grumbled in the fourier domain while they are preserved in the bpatial domain; a similar situation exigts in the bpatial shift among elements. on the other 
hand  the global organization of texture elements is expressed more succinctly in the fourier domain than in the spatial domain. we shall describe below the procedures of feature extraction in each respective domain. 
texture descriptors derived in the spatial domain 
since descriptors refer to properties of objects 
  texture elements  represented in the image space  it is natural to look for operators acting directly in the spatial domain. several low level operators have to be combined into a procedure to obtain the desired texture description. a skeleton of such a process usually consists of: procedures isolating the image elements  geometric description of image elements  and clustering of elements based on proximity and their spatial organization. a set of simple descriptors has been suggested and implemented by rosenfeld and thurston. they use  in parallel  several local averaging operators applied in different directions and on various sizes of windows. though this method finds some texture boundaries  the operators are too t r i v i a l for handling a wide class of real textures. besides  they do not provide any description of a texture  rather they only detect the texture differences. 
　　　tn the process of isolating the image elements the most important features are the following topological properties: connectivity  continuity  and proximity. these properties  applied to brightness or color  are used in a l l region finders. here  the a l gorithm is based on grouping a l l adjacent points with similar brightness and/or color. discontinuity is the basic property to be used in edge and line operators.-1 current edge and line operators are designed for detecting discontinuities between two large homogeneous regions and they do not operate satisfactorily on small regions. the textured elements that one finds in outdoor scenes are too small in size and too large in number to be processed usefully by any of the above operators. 
　　　after completing the isolating of image elements - figures  we shall describe them. 	we select those descriptors which enable clustering  i.e. based on proximity  those which w i l l find the nearby elements. in passing  i want to emphasize that color and brightness are among the most important descriptors in natural scenes. 	image elements cannot be taken separately from their background. 	in fact  the common background of the elements is a strong clue for their clustering. 	the relationship between the background and color is expressed in terms of contrast  and  therefore  it can be used as another descriptor. 
　　　since the shape of a two or three-dimensional object in a general situation could be extremely complicated  we cannot hope and  in fact  we do not want to describe it in detail. instead  complex shapes are decomposed into simpler ones which are hopefully easier to describe; the size of the texture elements must 
also be simplified to correspond with the shapeb. a typical example is a tree which may be decomposed into its trunk and crown  the trunk being geometrically l i n ear  the crown being blob-like. in shape analysis of outdoor scenes  we find directionality among the most useful features. 
　　　finally  we describe the spatial organization of texture elements. this amounts to the description of a new structure formed by the texture elements. here  the main problem is to recognize the whole as composed of texture elements. for example  the dots could form a straight line or a random dot pattern; straight lines 
with the same direction form parallel lines  etc. 
　　　l i m i t a t i o   o f spatial domain procedures despite the importance of descriptors derived in the spatial domain  we shall not use them in this work for the f o l lowing reason. currently available edge finders and region finders are tailored for large homogeneous regions. in natural scenes  textured areas are composed of small texture elements. even to the extent that the boundaries of s m a l l regions are determined  the data structures require unreasonably large memory  since the 
boundary descriptions are no longer economical. the next steps - description of elements and clustering e l ements of similar direction  size  color  or brightness - seem prohibitively time consuming and difficult for grass  pebbles  sand  etc. 
texture descriptors derived in the fourier domain 
     why do we suggest to use the fourier domain rather than the bpatial domain  an effective texture operator 
must have certain virtues. 	it should describe the spa-
t i a l distribution of texture elements  and it should characterize the shape and the size of the texture elements. 
　　　from the elementary properties of the fourier operator  it follows that any real periodic function has a symmetric fourier image with respect to the origin. an equally well-known but somewhat more interesting fact is that the power spectrum is invariant with respect to translation in the spatial domain  but not with respect to rotation. a t r i v i a l consiquence of this property is that the directionality of a pattern in the picture is preserved in the power spectrum  but the phase of the transform is not. 
　　　if a function is periodic  partially periodic  of almost periodic  then its fourier transform provides a more concise representation of the image  and the relational feature derived from the fourier image forms a good description of periodic or almost periodic patperns. for example  take an image of a texture composed of several parallel lines. its power spectrum w i l l have only one line. in addition  the power spec-
trum w i l l contain the information about the width of the line and the number of lines occurring in the image. 
　　　the fact that directionality is preserved in the power spectrum allows us to infer some gross bhape properties. he are able to distinguiah directional and non-directio- *1 rormonents of texture. for this reason  it is useful to transform the power spectrum from a cartesian coordinate system  r  p . then in each direction   one can regard p r m  as a one-dimensional function pffl r . similarly  for each frequency r  p  qi  is a one-dimensional function. in addition  if we integrate along direction {p  we obtain 
it 
	p r  * 1 z 	p  r    
	-1 	* 
 p 
and similarly  integration along radius produces w/1 
p    - 	i 	p   p  . r-1 
where w is the window size. 
     thus  the description of the texture depends in this method on the form of the pair of functions  p r   p o   .

bout the area to handle this situation appropriately  because the same component  wavelength - 1   which in the case of grass is undesirable  is in the case of the canvas texture an essential part of i t s description. 
　　　function p r  in the cases of grass and wood shows s i m i l a r i t i e s   which suggests that both of these 
textures have some noisy irregular backgrounds. on the other hand the canvas texture displays significant peaks in low frequency and decreasing power in higher frequencies. 
　　　for more detailed analysis of p r   one has to separate the different directionalities. this is what 
we have followed up in figures 1b  1b and 1c. 
　　　the last two examples of texture of blobs and band demonstrate the differences between nondirectional texturea. in fig. 1 and 1 are functions p tr  and p r  of samples of texture recorded in fig. 1 and fig. 1  respectively. table 1 contains their corresponding parameters. 
　　　the p {p  is a f l a t function in both textures as is expected. p r  in the case of blobs has one significant peak; whereas  in the case of sand  p r  is approximately f l a t . 

　　　we must make some comments about the differences between continuous and f i n i t e d i s c r e t e fourier t r a n s forms. the continuous fourier transform e x i s t s f o r every function w i t h f i n i t e energy  while the f i n i t e d i s c r e t e fourier transform e x i s t s for any f u n c t i o n . our i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s w i l l be based on the continuous transform and the actual computations on the discrete transform  fast fourier transform . the discrete transform is r e a l l y a fourier s e r i e s . a continuous fourier transform is r o t a t i o n a l l y i n v a r i a n t  except f o r windowing e f f e c t s     while a descrete transform has distinguished axes along the coordinate axis and the diagonals. thus  a d i r e c t i o n a l image has a continuous fourier transform in a very narrow band transform only f o r d i r e c t i o n s along the preferred a x i s . there is a corresponding d i f f i c u l t y i n d e f i n i n g fan f i l t e r s which 
we have not succeeded in s o l v i n g . 
　　　one should make a note of a f a i r l y important though elementary mathematical f a c t : namely  that the fourier transform does not preserve f u n c t i o n a l r e s t r i c t i o n . more s p e c i f i c a l l y   if g x y /w denotes the r e s t r i c i t o n of the image f u n c t i o n g   x   y   to a window w 
 so that g   x   y   is truncated outside w   	then 
f g x y |w  - f g x y  |w 
is true f o r every w only when g x y  is periodic w i t h period equal to the si1e of w. thus a fourier image of a truncated f u n c t i o n   truncated outside a window  w i l l in general depend also on the part of the f u n c t i o n g x y  whose domain is outside w. what t h i s means p r a c t i c a l l y is that c e r t a i n texture elements could be s p l i t in h a l f by windowing  and  as a consequence  an improper i n t e r p r e t a t i o n would be derived. this problem 
can be p a r t l y compensated for by overlapping windowing. 
conclusion 
       in t h i s paper we have presented procedures f o r des c r i b i n g textured surfaces by operating in the fourier domain of the image. although the d i r e c t i o n a l i t y in the fourier domain has already been recognized   it has not been used in texture d e s c r i p t i o n s . the novelty of t h i s method is that it recognizes some gross shape features  raonodirectional  b i d i r e c t i o n a l   nondirect i o n a l   e t c .   of textures in the fourier domain. in a d d i t i o n to the frequency p r o p e r t i e s   we are also able to make some estimates about the size of texture e l e -
ments. the descriptions are symbolic. they are associated w i t h a l i s t of parameters  with corresponding numerical values  that are used at a higher l e v e l in the h y p o t h e s i s - v e r i f i c a t i o n process. the data s t r u c ture of texture descriptors is f l e x i b l e and is expected to change during the h y p o t h e s i s - v e r i f i c a t i o n a c t i v i t y . we are aware of several weaknesses inherent in t h i s method. for instance  human perception tends to d i s count smooth changes in shading; yet the fourier t r a n s form r e f l e c t s not only the edges but also the slow changes. we are accustomed to regarding images in terms of homogeneous regions w i t h sharp boundaries and to describing elements by brightness and color contrast and o u t l i n e shape. in the fourier domain  these become jumbled in a way that is only approximately resolved by our h e u r i s t i c s ; thus  they are not always u s e f u l l y described. 
　　　in a d d i t i o n   the texture elements   t h e i r shape  and t h e i r organization are also jumbled together in the fourier domain. for instance  dots and small segments of l i n e s organized in p a r a l l e l - l i n e d fashion w i l l be described equally as monodirectlonal texture and  t h e r e f o r e   not in f u l l d e t a i l . for more d e t a i l   one has to apply the s p a t i a l   l o c a l operators. 
       to sum it up  there are several possible t e x t u r e operators  such as s t a t i s t i c a l and fourier operators  i n t e r v a l a n a l y s i s   and others. some operators are b e t t e r than others. thus  the fourier operators are very e f f i c i e n t for l i n e a r perodic textures as w e l l as for l i n e a r regular but not periodic t e x t u r e s . take grassy f i e l d s   waves in the water  e t c . they are also useful for random dot patterns as long as the question is only the r e c o g n i t i o n of random organization versus regular organization  example the sand t e x t u r e   . however  fourier operator w i l l f a i l t o recognize the differences in more d e t a i l e d shapes of texture elements. for example  it w i l l not d i s t i n g u i s h texture made of   c a p i t a l a  and t r i a n g l e s  a  of the same size and o r g a n i z a t i o n . here more l o c a l operators are necessary. so the spat i a l technique  being more l o c a l and therefore more accurate in some sense  can complement the fourier t e c h nique. which operator is used where should be determined by higher l e v e l program.
