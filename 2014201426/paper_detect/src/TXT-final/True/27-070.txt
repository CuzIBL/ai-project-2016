 
nonmonotonic formalisms and belief revision operators have been introduced as useful tools to describe and reason about evolving scenarios both approaches have been proven effective in a number of different situations however  little is known about their relationship previous work by winslett has shown some correlations between a specific operator and circumscription in this paper we greatly extend winslett's work by establishing new relations between circumscription and a large number of belief revision operators this highlights similarities and differences between these formalisms furthermore these connections provide us with the possibility of importing results in one field into the other one 
1 	introduction 
during the last years  many formalisms have been proposed in the ai literature to model commonsense reasoning particular emphasis has been put in the formal modeling of a distinct feature of commonsense reasoning  that is  its nonmonotonic nature the ai goal of providing a logic model of human agents' capability of reasoning in the presence of incomplete or contradictory information has proven to be a very hard one nevertheless  many important formalisms have been put forward in the literature 
　two main approaches have been proposed to handle the nonmonotonic aspects of commonsense reasoning the first one deals with this problem  by defining a new logic equipped with a nonmonotonic consequence operator important examples of this approach are default logic proposed in  reiter  1  and circumscription introduced in  mccarthy  1  the second one relies on preserving a classical  monotonic  inference operator  but introduces a revision operator that accommodates a new piece of information into an existing body 
   'work partially supported by the esprit basic research action n 1 compulog ii  n 1 medlar and the 
progetlo finalizzato informatica & calcolo parallelo of the 
cnr  italian research council  
of knowledge specific revision operators have been introduced  among the others  in  ginsberg  1  and in  dalai  1  a general framework for revision has been proposed by alchourron gardenfors and makinson in chourrr n et of   1  gardenfors  1  a close variant of revision is update the general framework for update has been studied in  katsuno and mendelzon  1  
1  and specific operators have been proposed in 
 winslett 1  and  forbus 1  
　in this paper we investigate the relationship between circumscription and many operators for belief revision and update a first study of these relations has been done in  winslett  1   where she relates her operator to circumscription we expand her results showing similar connections between several other belief revision operators and circumscription to this end we also in troduce a variant of circumscription based on cardinality rather than set-containment 
　the established correlations highlight the relations between the two fields moreover  as side benefits  they provide us with the opportunity to import results in one field into the other one 
　a distinct approach to model the nonmonotonic aspect of commonsense reasoning is via a logic of actions even though this aspect is out of the scope of this paper  we want to point out the results presented in  kharta and lifschitz  1  where it is shown how to express a very general logic of action using circumscription 
　the paper lb organized as follows in section 1 we recall some key definitions and results for belief revision and circumscription  introduce a variant of circumscription  ncirc  and explain the notation used throughout the following sections jn section 1 we show the main re-
lations between revision operators and circumscription  while in section 1 we show relations and reductions between the vancus operators in section 1 we focus on syntactically restricted knowledge bases section 1 discusses the impact of our results with particular attention to the computational complexity analysis finally  in section 1 we draw some conclusions 
1 	preliminaries 
in this section we  very briefly  present the background and terminology needed to understand the results presented later in the paper for the sake of simplicity

in this section we focus on knowledge bases of a restricted syntactic form among the restricted cases  horn knowledge bases are of particular interest for several reasons first of all  since horn clauses can represent causality relations  they are expressive enough to represent many real situations moreover  reasoning with horn knowledge bases is significantly simpler than reasoning with general ones  see  dowling and gallier  1   and also revising them is  in general  simpler than revising general ones  see  eiter and gottlob  1   
　 while reductions from circumscription to belief revision preserve the syntactic form of the original theory  reductions from belief revision to circumscription do not preserve the syntactic form of the formulae  s an example  notice that the relation x 』 y cannot be expressed as an horn formula 
　as a consequence  it is easy to apply results on restricted cases of belief revision to circumscription  but the other way around is less likely to produce interesting results 
　there are several reasons why the revision of horn theories cannot be expressed as the circumscription of a horn formula first of all  results of eiter and gottlob show that reasoning with the revision of a horn knowledge base is conp hard for all operators consid ered  while reasoning with horn theories under circumscription is a polynomial task as a consequence  reductions from belief revision to circumscription preserving the syntactic form cannot be done in polynomial time  assuming p 』 np  
　secondly  the result of revising a horn knowledge base with a horn formula might be a non-horn formula for example  the result of {a  b} *  ~ a v - b  is a 』 b for all operators  and a 』 b cannot be expressed as an horn formula on the other hand  the circumscription of a horn theory is an horn theory

1 	computational complexity analysis 
a valuable byproduct of the reductions presented in this work is the ability of importing complexity results obtained in one field into the other one for example  in the general case  inference using the belief revision op-
erators introduced by satoh  borgida and winslett has the same complexity of inference under circumscription while this result is not novel  it has been proven in  eiter and gottlob  1   several other interesting results can be obtained as an example  it is known that deciding whether a clause follows from the circumscription  with all letters minimized  of a theory composed of b1 nary clauses  l e clauses with at most two literals  is a conp-hard problem  cadoli and lenzemni  1  we can use this result to prove that inference in the revision of a knowledge base composed of binary clauses is a conp-hard problem for all operators except dalai's one 
1 	conclusions 
we have presented a complete analysis of the relations between belief revision operators on one hand and circumscription and its cardinality-based variant on the 

other hand furthermore  we have pointed out the many benefits that the established correlations can deliver to the analysis of both fields 
　our results greatly extends winslett's results on transforming her revision operator into circumscription presented in  winslett  1  even though winslett's analysis could be further extended to deal with other operators  our results provide us with more direct and simple translations
