1 	introduction 
graphical presentations can be an effective method for such cinctly communicating information about multiple diverse dala attnbutes and their interrelationships a number of research groups are attempting to develop systems that automatically generate such presentations  casner 1 mackinlay 1 roth el al 1  when a display in eludes only a small number of data attributes or only makes use ot conventional graphical styles  e g spreadsheet graph ics  it is easy for a viewer to understand how to interpret it however one of the main goals for automatic presentation systems is to allow users to see complex relationships between domains and perform problem solving tasks  eg summarizing finding correlations or groupings and analyzing trends in dala  that involve many data attributes al the same time these v isualizations are often both novel and complex they can only be fully effective for supporting such analysis tasks 
　　this work was supported by grant number daa 1 from the advanced research projects agency  arpa  
1 natural language 
if accompanied by explanations designed to enable users to understand how the graphics express the information they contain furthermore studies  e g  nugent 1   have shown that the presentation of captions with pictures can significantly improve both recall and comprehension compared to either pictures or captions alone 
　in this paper we propose a framework for automatically generating explanatory captions to accompany graphical pre sentations of combinations of diverse data sets the graphical displays are designed by an automatic presentation system sage  roth ft at 1  and are often complex for several reasons first they typically display many dala attributes al once the mapping of many different data attnbutes to multiple graphical ob ects can be difficult to determine from the graphics alone second integrating multiple datj attnbutes in a display requires designing graphics that are unlamihar to most users accustomed to simple spreadsheet displays ol individual data attributes while these integrated displays can be verv useful once they are explained it is difficult to under stand them completely without accompanying explanations finally the nature of the data with which we are concerned is inherently abstract and does not have an obvious or natural visual representation unlike depictions of real world objects or processes  e g radios  feiner and mckeown 1  cof fee makers  wahlsler el al 1  network diagrams  marks !1lj  and visualizations of scientific data  eg weather medical images  visualizations of abstract information lack an obvious geometric analog 
　as an example of the type of data we are concerned with consider the graphic shown in fig i this is a sage generated version ol the famous graphic drawn by minard in 1 depicting napoleon s march of 1  roth et al 
1  the graphic relates many different variables position  latitude and longitude  troop size direction of movement temperature and dates and locations of battles unless one has seen this graphic  or a very similar one  before it cannot be understood and used to its fullest extent 
　consider how the following human-generated caption for the graphic in fig i explains the picture as well as the under lying data 
   this graphic shows march segments and battles from napoleon 1 campaign the map shows the relation between the geographic locations temperature and number of troops for each segment each line show the start and end locations for the march segment its color1 shows the: tern 


with this caption this complex integrated graphic can be fullv appreciated for the amount of information it conveys so succinetly and clearly 
   although several pro ccls have focused on the question ot how such intelligent graphical presentations can he automatically generated  c asner 1  mackinlay i1 roth and hefley 1  they have not addressed the problem of generating the accompanying textual explanations in this paper we describe an implemented system designed to gen erate explanatory captions by integrating two robust systems the sage intelligent graphics presentation system |roth el ai 1  and a natural language generation framework consist ing ot a text planner  moore and paris 1  and a sentence realizer  elhadad 1  this system generates explanatory captions for complex graphical presentations that integrate multiple data attributes by  1  aligning sequences of multi ple charts and lables  1  composing graphical objects  eg points bars lines gauges text strings  within each chart and  1  using multiple graphical properties of each object lo 
encode data attributes  e g shape color size line thickness ete   this is an important application domain since these types of graphics represent a significant portion of data that must be presented for many business applications  schmid 1  
　the system selects data to be presented in the caption by taking into account both the characteristics of the data  e g the range and type of attributes as well as the relationships among them  and the way data objects and attributes have

been mapped to graphical oh|ects in the presentations generated bv sage the system organies is explaninations using one of three explanation strategies and determines how much to say about any individual data lo graphic mapping based on heuristics about the complexity of understanding that particular type of mapping

   generating textual captions for visualizations of abstract or relational information requires the following 
  a representation of the s nru  of graphical displays that is the structural spatial and other relations among graphical objects and their properties 
  a representation of the  emuntu v of graphical displays that is the way they map from data ob|ects and their attributes lo graphical ones 
  a mechanism for determining which aspects of graphical displays must be explained based on their perceptual complexity or the complexity of the data attributes they express
