   factory simulation: an extendable  interactive discrete simulation system has been constructed that interprets the factory model d i r e c t l y . it allows the user to dynamically query the simulation for state information   e . g .   state of a machine  process  e t c .     where objects are located   e . g .   what operation is being carried out on an order   and regular s t a t i s t i c a l analyses. it also allows the user to a l t e r the factory model before and during simulation. the factory can be simulated and displayed  on a color graphics device  at variable levels of d e t a i l . the simulation system is integrated with the scheduling system to allow the testing of scheduling heuristics and/or changes to the factory model. 
　　factory scheduling: an i n t e r a c t i v e   real-time  job-shop scheduling system has been constructed which interprets the factory model d i r e c t l y . it allows the user to enter orders and associate scheduling constraints such as time  cost  operations  and machines. the system w i l l generate a schedule that attempts to satisfy the constraints. the system uses a knowledge-based heuristic search to construct forward  from start date  or backward  from due date  planned schedules. the user also specifies state information for the factory   e . g .   machine f a i l u r e s   maintenance  order finished on a 
　　particular machine  e t c .   . the system does a minimal rescheduling in reaction to any state change of the factory.
