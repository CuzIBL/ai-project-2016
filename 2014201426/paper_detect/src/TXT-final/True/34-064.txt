the ultimate goal of the research described here is to develop a computer program that could cons t r u c t a h i e r a r c h i c a l l y organi zed semantic network from natural language input t e x t . this network conc i s t s of a set of concepts and a set of many-place r e l a t i o n s over t h i s set. examples of these r e l a tions are the r e l a t i o n between a term and i t s su~ perordi nated term  called sup  e.g.  mapping  sup  homeomorphism   or the r e l a t i o n ref between an adjective and each noun that could be modified by this adjective e.g.  commutative  ref  group - rel a t i o n s among terms; can expand to r e l a t i o n s among terms and networks. for example  the r e l a t i o n ref holds between the a d j f c t i v e  continuous  and the 
noun  mapping . thi s can be described by the network 

hierarchical graph  see   1 !   . to construct  such a network  one can use hierarchical network generat i o n rules as described in . the network obtained from an input text should be able to reproduce the meaning of the text completely and prec i s e l y   that is to say  it should be the semantics of the appropriate t e x t . so the coordination of natural language text to a network  being realized by a computer program  represents what we mean by understanding the t e x t : the f i t t i n g computer program underetands natural language discourse. complete reproduction of di scourse by a network means that no information is lost on the transduction of the text i n t o the network and consequently that it should be possible to reconstruct the primary text  from the network once generated. but the recon-
s t r u c t i o n is not one-valued. there could be more than one text being reproduced from a network  f o r there might occur d i f f e r e n t texts to have the same meaning  and these must correspond to the same n e t work. so generally we obtain one single network for more than one t e x t . precise reproduction of discourse by a network means that for each text there could be at most one network i n t o which t h a t text is transduced. so the coordination t e x t s - n e t works is a n o n - i n j e c t i v e mapping. this mapping is realized in the following way: there has been 
w r i t t e n a formal grammar describing a r b i t r a r y n a t u r a l language texts by whi ch a phrase structure tree is b u i l t for each sentence  see c1 . trie semantic rules are formulated dependent on the syntax trees following step-by-step transduction of a phrase structure tree i n t o a semantic network f r a g ment*. the concatenation of a l l the fragments obtained by a t e x t is the f i n a l network. in the f o l lowing we w i l l demonstrate  for an example sentence  the e f f e c t of the program  that is to say  how it understands a t e x t . the example sentence stems from a mathematical text out of general topology.

for t h i s d e f i n i t i o n the program finds out: 
1. what concept is defined  
p. what other concepts do help to accomplish the d e f i n i t i o n

the names of the concepts  given to them in the t e x t   are kept for f u r t h e r references. later on they can be replaced by the concepts they design. the p r e p o s i t i o n a l r e l a t i o n of holds between a concept and i t s prepositional supplement. the r e l a t i o n s eps and cont belong to the mathematical signs  and

1. transformation of a 	np 	to a proper noun. 
1. transformation of an embedded sentence to a partipicial sentence. 
we will not l i s t transformations here in detail  for they are not relevant for the meaning of sentences. they only generate surface structures from deep structures. lex can be seen in detail in the program data. 
the set of concepts occurring in a definition together with the hierarchical graph they form is built up in a step-by-step manner corresponding to the phrase structure of the definition. this can be done by assigning attributes to the nonterminal symbols and semantic rules to the production rules. each attribute a corresponds to a set of values va . the semantic rules define all of the attributes of a nonterminal in terms of the attributes of its immediate descendants  so ultimately values are defined for each attribute. 
for our purposes  we have used a set of attributes 
a = {d  c  g  lex  n} where 
vd is the power set of the set of all concepts. the value of d within a definition will be the set of concepts defined. vc is the power set of the set of all concepts. 
the value of c within a definition will be the set of a l l concepts occurring in the definition. vg is the set of hierarchical graphs. the value of g within a definition will be the hierarchical graph that means this definition. 
v lex is the union set of a l l sets of lexical entries of g . 
vn is the set of relation names. the value of n within parts of a definition is an arc label belonging to the hierarchical graph being built up. 
the attributes correspond to the nonterminal symbols in the following way: 
g 	belongs to {def  s  s1  s1  s1  c  cnb  nd  ap  
np  npo  np1  n  ad  pp  predd  dab  ss  vp  
     ss1  c 	belongs to the same symbols as 	g . d 	belongs to {def  s  s1  s1  c  dnb  nd  predd  
     dab  ad} lex belongs to {nb  ab  adv  verb  prep  n belongs to {vp  pp}. 
now the grammar may be augmented so  that semantic rules are given for each rule of the syntax.

sample sentence recognition and network transduct i o n

the reduction and transduction i n t o the network of the f i r s t part of t h i s sentence is as follows: 


1 the computer program that has been w r i t t e n for the construction of a semantic network from the d e f i n i t i o n of  general topology  acts on the basis of a dictionary of t r i v i a l terms which - at the beginning of a run - only contains a r t i c l e s   preposit i o n s   pronouns and verbs. there are only about seven verbs in this mathematical t e x t s . these can be treated as terms not bearing conceptual informat i o n because they generally do not act as concepts.  exception: to converge. but for t h i s verb there is an a d j e c t i v a l equivalent: convergent.  in performing the network construction  the program recognizer    learns   the terms occurring in the text ar. well as t h e i r grammatical category using these  learned facts  to analyse the further d e f i n i t i o n s . the grammar rules do not act as parameters of the program but are inserted as procedures. this makes the program more e f f i c i e n t but less i n d i f f e r e n t to changes. the algorithm p a r t l y proceeds l i k e a f o r -
mal language recognition algorithm  i . e . it attempts to match sentence parts with r i g h t hand sides of the grammar r u l e s . but the sentence structure is determined only in so far as it is needed by the semantic r u l e s . 
open questions 
1. embeddings of more than one prepositional clause. 
production rule  1  allows to embed one preposifurther 	development 
actually we are developping an algorithm to work on d e f i n i t i o n s out of the area of computer science. to perform t h i s we w i l l need more conceptual categories and r e l a t i o n s that is to say we w i l l need verbs as concepts and conceptual r e l a t i o n s between verbs and nouns. this program is intended to work with rules as parameters. so it can be used f o r more than one grammar l a t e r . we intend to implement it with the help of a compiler compiler. 

t i o n a l supplement for a noun phrase. by rule  1  and again  1  we can embed recursively another prepositional clause. clauses l i k e  an i n t e r i o r point of a subset a of x . . .   are c o r r e c t l y analysed by these r u l e s . but consider the clause  a 
mapping f of a topological space x i n t o a set x' . . .   . the analysis of this clause by the rules described above is not adequate because the two npo  a topological space x  and  a set x'   are both embedded p a r a l l e l l y i n t o the npo  a 
mapping 	f  . to f i n d the correct analysis in each 
case  we need the information that  mapping  gen-
e r a l l y requires two prepositional supplements whereas   p o i n t   and  subset  require only one. 
1. if we embed a r e l a t i v e clause i n t o a noun phrase containing a prepositional supplement we can not on the basis of syntax rules - correctly determine to which noun the r e l a t i v e pronoun r e f e r s . in the clause*an i n t e r i o r point of the set which contains . . .   the reference can be determined correctly using the semantic information that only sets but not points can contain anything. but in the clause  a set of the f i l t e r which contains . . .   the correct coordination is not possible because a
