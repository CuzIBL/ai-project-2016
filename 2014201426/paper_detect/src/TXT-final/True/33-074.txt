	i 	introduction 
       the aim of the reseda p r o j e c t is the cons t r u c t i o n and p r a c t i c a l e x p l o i t a t i o n of a database o f b i o g r a p h i c a l i n f o r m a t i o n d e a l i n g w i t h the l i v e s of a c e r t a i n number of important people in france d u r i n g the l a t e middle ages* the p r i n c i p a l charact e r i s t i c from an ai p o i n t of view is being able to 
question the system about causal r e l a t i o n s h i p s   which may e x i s t between d i f f e r e n t a t t e s t e d f a c t s in the database  but which are not e x p l i c i t l y recorded. if the r e p l i e s are considered p l a u s i b l e by the userh i s t o r i a n   then the new causal r e l a t i o n s h i p s can be permanently recorded in the base. thus the system may be p r o g r e s s i v e l y improved by use. 
       to c a r r y out these inference o p e r a t i o n s   reseda uses two a d d i t i o n a l sets of data besides the b i o g r a p h i c a l i n f o r m a t i o n proper. these two sets of data c o n s t i t u t e the system's  general knowledge  o f i t s p a r t i c u l a r f i e l d . the f i r s t gives the h i s t o r i c a l background f o r the p e r i o d ; f o r example  i n f o r m a t i o n on the s o c i a l   economic and bureaucratic e t c . s t r u c t u r e s of l a t e french mediaeval society  i n f o r m a t i o n about important events   e . g . the  hundred years war    i d e o l o g i c a l trends e t c . the

these p e r m i t   f o r example  t o p - l e v e l changes in the state a d m i n i s t r a t i o n to be explained in terms of changes i n p o l i t i c a l power. 
　　　therefore reseda u t i l i s e s knowledge inherent to a w e l l - d e f i n e d subject area to achieve the concrete o b j e c t i v e of s i m u l a t i n g an e x p e r t ' s behavi o u r w i t h i n t h i s f i e l d ; hence i t may  i n some 
respects  be compared to systems designed on the p r i n c i p l e s o f  knowledge engineering    1   . this coherence of purpose is a l s o r e f l e c t e d on a more t e c h n i c a l l e v e l : f o r example  the format and method of a c t i v a t i n g the inference r u l e s used by reseda conforms to the general t h e o r e t i c a l framework d e f i n e d by the  consequent theorems  of planner   1   as do r u l e s of the   s i t u a t i o n - f a c t i o n   type used by most expert systems . 
　　　however  reseda has c e r t a i n s p e c i a l charact e r i s t i c s which are unusual in most expert systems  such as mycin c1   prospector   1     e t c . 
a. the s p e c i a l i z e d knowledge which must be 
introduced i n t o the system is characterized by the t o t a l absence of any systematization or f o r m a l i z a t i o n - who indeed may claim to know the laws of h i s t o r y   
b. the i n f o r m a t i o n t h a t reseda is r e q u i r e d to 
process r e f e r s mainly to   a b s t r a c t n o t i o n s     such a s the p o l i t i c a l and r e l i g i o u s a t t i t u d e s   b e l i e f s and ideology of the people concerned   1     r a t h e r than  concrete o b j e c t s   l i k e b a c t e r o i d e s   igneous rocks or nuclear submarines. therefore reseda has some c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s in common w i t h the   b e l i e f systems   as d e f i n e d by abelson   1   in o p p o s i t i o n to  knowledge systems . abelson emphasizes t h a t   b e l i e f systems have not been very popular o b j e c t s o f study i n a i     1 : 1 1   ; indeed  i t would b e d i f f i c u l t to c i t e many p r o j e c t s which share a substant i a l numbers of reseda's o b j e c t i v e s   even t a k i n g

carbonell 	  1 ; 1   	and kolodner   1     
       these c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s do not make it easy to i d e n t i f y the knowledge necessary to c o n s t r u c t the system  p a r t i c u l a r l y in the case of the common sense r u l e s . to avoid f a l l i n g i n t o the t r a p of c o n s t r u c t i n g these r u l e s a p r i o r i from an a b s t r a c t p o i n t of view  which could o n l y lead to a dangerous h y p e r s i m p l i f i c a t i o n - see the famous example of the   b e r l i n w a l l   c1  - the designers of reseda 

1 

have decided to emphasize the principle that a l l information to be introduced into an expert system 
must be obtained by reproducing the actual behaviour of specialists within the given f i e l d . this 
means that any inference rule used in reseda is only a formalization and a generalization of the reasoning  or a part of i t   effectively used by an historian in a concrete situation  1 . the reseda team has created an entire methodology from scratch for representing historical reasoning  which has been progressively refined throughout the course of the project. it is the description of i t s present state which is the object of this paper. 
	ii 	fundamental concepts of the reseda system. 
　　　the biographical information which constitutes the system' s database is organized in the form of units called  coded episodes'* or  planes . there are several 
different types of plane; the  predicative plane**  the most important  corresponds to a  flash  which illustrates a particular moment in the   l i f e story  of one or more persons. a predicative plane is made up of one of five possible  predicates   be-affected -by  behave  be-present  move  produce   to which one or more  modulators  may be attached. the modulators' function is to specify and delimit the semantic role of the predicate. of course  the  meaning  of the modulator plus predicate is  defined  - as for a l l elements of the reseda data definition language   metalanguage   - by the general behaviour 
of the system rather than by the usual function of these codes in natural language - see also hayes  1-1 . the predicate of the plane is accompanied by  case slots   1  which introduce the predicate arguments. 
　　　dating and space location information is also given with a predicative plane  as is the b i b l i ographic authority for the statement. predicative planes may be linked either through the label of one plane being the value of an argument slot  the slot obj  in another  or through explicit links  and    or    cause     f i n a l i t y   etc. 
　　　the extremely simple example fiven in figure 1 should provide a clearer idea of what i have just explained; it is the representation of  robert de bonnay was named b a l l l l of macon on 1th september 1 by the king's council   bibliographical authori t y : demurger ; the   b a i l l l   was an officer who dispensed justice  administered finances  etc.  for a particular area   ballliage   in the name of a king or lord . 

the codes given in capital letters indicate the predicate and the cases associated with i t . for each predicative plane there is a pair of temporal 
markers   datel - date1   which give the duration of the episode  the predicates are  therefore  
 state  predicates . in the above example  which concerns only the beginning of a state  modulator  incep     date1  is obviously empty.  robert de bonnay  is a  vedette  i.e. one of the historical persons whose   l i f e story  is recorded in the system ;   b a i l l i    meaning the  post of bailli   and  king's-council  are entries in reseda's lexicon. the classifications associated with the lexical terms provide essential information for the system as regards the historical background of the period.  micon  and  paris  are obviously the  object location  and the  source location  respectively. if the historical documents give us e x p l i c i t l y the pre-
cise causes of this nomination  then the corresponding planes would be introduced into the database and the  nomination  plane would be associated with them by an explicit link of the  caused-by  type. 
　　　when the system is considered from the point of view of i t s u t i l i z a t i o n   the fundamental concept which must be introduced is that of the  search 
model . 
　　　a  search model  gives the essential elements  expressed in terms of the reseda metalanguage  of a coded episode which it is necessary to search for in the database. a search model may originate from 
outside the system  if it is the direct translation of a query posed by a user. on the other hand  it may be automatically generated by the system. this happens during a search for  causes  when one tries to retrieve the planes which supply the presuppositions of a certain known episode. a search model 
may  independent of i t s origin  be  transformed  into a semantically  equivalent  model if an im-
passe is reached while trying to match the model with data in the base. 
let us suppose  then  that the user questions 
reseda on the subject of the progression of robert de bonnay's career  asking  for example   did robert de bonnay exercise the power of a b a i l l i during the f i r s t quarter of the 1th century . in this case the user himself creates the search model given in figure 1  with aid of a prompting program. 

　　　the only notable difference between this formalism and that required for representation of the episodes in the database is that of the presence of a  search interval    boundl - bound1   which is used to define the temporal limits of the search. therefore  the search interval has the function of limiting the planes to be examined  and has only an indirect relationship with the temporal information of the  date  type which is associated to each of the episodes recorded in the base. 
　　　i do not intend  here  to go into the details of the procedure adopted to test the match of a search model with data in the base ; instead  for details of t h i s   see zarri et a l .  1 . it i s   for example  obvious that the model in figure 1 

1 

may be directly matched with the plane in figure 1 ; this of course is the exception rather than the rule. 
　　　in the  case of a dead end  a f i r s t class of inference rules may be applied to the model  that is the  transformations . to keep to an extremely simple example  the search model : 
	 for+behave 	subj x 	obj y  = 
          to be favourable towards...  could be substituted by the model : 
　　　 against+behave subj x. obj y  given that information regarding the unfavourable attitude of person x toward person y is at the same time a response to any query about the possib i l i t y of a favourable attitude. note the existence of an underlying common sense rule even in such a simple transformation. 
　　　a second example of a transformation is that given in figure 1. the underlying common sense rule is :   i f a person x  has a university degree w  then this person has followed some course v   one or several persons y have  produced  the course  r with the intention of x . in figure 1  i have only partially detailed the  restrictions  associated with the  variables  x  y  v and w; 

the use of variables allows maximum generality in the formulation of the common sense law 	underlying the transformation. the values which replace the 
variables in the retrieved plane  or planes  using the transformed model must obviously respect these restrictions ; for example  the particular type of  degree  which w i l l have been substituted for w must be compatible with the value of v  in the original model  which i have indicated for simplicity as w = f  v  . 
　　　unlike the transformation  for/against  given earlier  the transformation in figure 1 is  one-way   that i s   it is possible to transform the model from l e f t to right  but not the inverse. 
　　　very often the passage of one model to another is subject to certain conditions ; it is only possible to substitute one model for the other if a 
particular condition has been satisfied. this is verified by checking the existence of episodes within the base which are able to guarantee the appro-
priate context. 
　　　figure 1 shows the formulation in natural language of two f a i r l y simple conditional transformations. it is clear that  in the cases of  conditional  transformations  the  semantic distance  between the information found using the transformed model and that sought at the outset may be quite large. in the most general case  therefore  the 

information retrieved by means of the transformed 
model is designed to suggest possible new semantic associations rather than a real reply to the search procedure originally instigated. 
　　　even taking into consideration this f i r s t category of inference rules  the behaviour of the system such as it has been described up to now is entirely classic in type. reseda has  however  a second  more original method of research : it is 
possible to search for the  causes  of an attested fact in the base. for example  if the user  in sub-
mitting the query in figure 1  obtained in reply the plane in figure 1  he would be able to continue his enquiry into the career of robert de bonnay by asking the system if it knows the reasons for his nomination as   b a i l l i   of macon. if the  causes  are not e x p l i c i t l y registered in the system  the function of replying to this type of query is the domain of a second category of inference rules  the  hypotheses . 
　　　in order to give some idea of the functioning of the hypotheses on an intuitive level  figure 1 shows the formulation in natural language of four 
of the hypotheses which are at present in the system. 
　　　the f i r s t part of each of these rules corresponds to a particular class of confirmed facts  planes  for which one asks the causes. for example  the plane in figure 1 is clearly an exemplification 
of the f i r s t part of the fourth hypothesis in f i g ure 1. in reseda's terminoloqy  the formal redaction of this f i r s t part is called a  premiss . the second part  the  condition   gives instructions for searching the database for information which would be able to j u s t i f y the fact which has been matched with the premiss. that i s   if planes matching the particular search models which can be obtained from the  condition  part of the hypothesis can be found in the database  it is considered that the facts represented by these planes could constitute the justification for the plan-premiss and are then returned as the response to the user's query. 
　　　figure 1 gives the planes obtained by means of the condition part of the fourth hypothesis in f i g ure 1 in the case of the query about robert de bonnay's nomination. the following chapter w i l l be devoted to the steps which  by generalizing and formalizing the observations of the historian

	stages 	: 
	a  the 	i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of a p o s s i b l e user-
question of the type  cause  which cannot be s a t i s f a c t o r i l y answered e i t h e r by d i r e c t matching 
w i t h the data present in memory or by an inference procedure already contained in the system  but where the s p e c i a l i s t s in mediaeval h i s t o r y are capable of p i c k i n g out planes from reseda's d a t a base c o n t a i n i n g data which may i n d i r e c t l y provide the i n f o r m a t i o n needed f o r the r e p l y . 
b  on the basis of t h i s i n f o r m a t i o n and the 
l o g i c a l r e l a t i o n s h i p s among the planes found  the a n a l y s t t r i e s to produce a formal   c o n d i t i o n     or sequence of t h e o r e t i c a l schemata of planes   con-
d i t i o n schemata    which correspond to the p a r t i c u l a r planes pointed out by the h i s t o r i a n and a l l other planes which could provide an answer in analogous s i t u a t i o n s . the c o n d i t i o n must be able t o e x p l a i n a l l the s p e c i f i c r e a l i z a t i o n s o f the   p r e m i s s     t h a t i s   of the general scheme underl y i n g the coded episode whose causes were o r i g i n a l l y requested. the  premiss   the   c o n d i t i o n     and t h e i r   v a r i a b l e s   and   r e s t r i c t i o n s on the v a r i a b l e s   together make up the formal  hypothe s i s   . 
c  once t h i s c l a s s i c l i n e of i n d u c t i v e reason-
ing   1   has been worked o u t   then the semantic type of the e m p i r i c a l l y discovered hypothesis is determined and a  name  is then given to the hypothesis   f o r example  f o r the f o u r t h hypothesis given in f i g u r e 1  we have  the hypothesis of nomin a t i o n f o l l o w i n g a change of government  . 
       i f t h i s methodology i s applied s t r i c t l y   i t gives r i s e to at l e a s t two types of major i n c o n venience . 
d  from the general p o i n t of view  	the growth 
of the corpus of hypotheses is p u r e l y random and cumulative : each hypothesis is constructed as a s i n g l e u n i t   t o t a l l y independent o f other inference r u l e s in the system. thus  a p o s t e r i o r i   many part i a l overlaps can be discovered  several inference r u l e s have indeed recourse in an independent way to some general p r i n c i p l e s   such as t h a t of   c o n t r a d i c t i o n       as are redundancies on the c o n d i t i o n schemata l e v e l of the same hypothesis  several schemata express the same concept w i t h s l i g h t sem-

tematic i n s e r t i o n a t the c o n d i t i o n l e v e l o f a l l data discovered by the h i s t o r i a n   r a p i d l y leads to an important c o m p l i c a t i o n on the formal plane. the exponential growth of p o s s i b l e r e l a t i o n s h i p s between d i f f e r e n t elements of the hypothesis in e f f e c t f o r c e s the i n t r o d u c t i o n o f innumerable v a r i ables and very complicated r e s t r i c t i o n s   see f o r example  the  hypothesis of coherence of r o l e     1 : 1 1 - 1 1   . this can o n l y imply considerable delays on the l e v e l of the e f f e c t i v e execution of

       no doubt everything t h a t i have j u s t set f o r t h w i l l seem r a t h e r ad hoc  and t h i s impression w i l l be even stronger due to the r h e t o r i c a l a r t i f i c e t h a t i have  f o r reasons of c l a r i t y   adopted in my t e x t   t h a t is using the same d a t a   both in the cons t r u c t i o n and e x e m p l i f i c a t i o n phases. in r e a l i t y   t h i s extremely a n a l y t i c c o n s t r u c t i o n procedure makes it possible f o r the system of hypotheses and t r a n s formations to a t t a i n a degree of complexity and s u b t l e t y which is s u f f i c i e n t to cover a very large number of p o s s i b l e i n f e r e n c e s . 
       i w i l l now add two observations. the f i r s t   which is i m p l i c i t in everything t h a t i have w r i t t e n  see f o r example the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n in  hypothesis mode  of the transformations in f i g u r e 1   concerns the fundamental i d e n t i t y of the hypotheses and t r a n s f o r m a t i o n s . although used in two a p r i o r i very d i f f e r e n t f u n c t i o n s   thev have b a s i c a l l y an 
analogous f u n c t i o n   t h a t of suggesting uses of new search models which may lead to i n f o r m a t i o n having a n i n t e r e s t i n g l o g i c a l r e l a t i o n s h i p w i t h those o r i g i n a l l y sought ; t h a t i s   to suggest i n t e l l i g e n t  connections . 
       the second is t h a t the a n a l y t i c phase of cons t r u c t i o n described i n t h i s paper  must obviously be followed by a phase of synthesis which allows the regrouping of the inference r u l e s by means of 
most general 	  a b s t r a c t i o n l e v e l s   . 	here i w i l l 
l i m i t myself to s t a t i n g t h a t we have turned to a  metarule  type methodology  see davis   1 ; 1     in order to resolve these problems ; some d e t a i l s on our approach may be found in   1   . 
       i w i l l conclude by r e c a l l i n g t h a t   even if c e r t a i n elementary modules have been in use since 1  the c o n s t r u c t i o n of the system in i t s complexity 
  noting t h a t   u n l i k e most other expert systems  reseda must maintain a r e a l   permanent database  o n l y began w i t h the phase reseda/1 in 1. considerable work from the computational p o i n t of view has thus been accomplished in these l a s t few years  on both the a n a l y t i c and programming l e v e l s   see once again   1 ; 1 ; 1   . we expect the completion of a p r o t o t y p e system to a r r i v e in the autumn of 1.
