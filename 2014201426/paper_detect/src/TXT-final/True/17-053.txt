 
　　　much of the problem solving done by both novices and experts uses  case-based  reasoning  or reasoning by analogy to previous similar cases. we explore the ways in which case-based reasoning can help in problem solving. according to our model  transfer of knowledge between cases is guided largely by the problem solving process i t s e l f . our model shows the interactions between problem solving processes and memory for experience. our computer program  called the mediator  illustrates case-based reasoning in interpreting and resolving common sense disputes. 
	1. 	using previous cases in problem solving 
　　　most approaches to problem solving in al treat each problem as a unique case. one deficiency of such problem solvers is that they cannot rely on previous experience. the same problem presented two different times requires the same  possibly long and complex  set of reasoning steps. nor can such systems learn from the mistakes they have made. suppose  however  that our systems could augment their problem solving capabilities by making analogies to previous similar cases. reference to a previous case focuses reasoning on those parts of a current problem which were important in analysis of the previous case  potent i a l l y reducing the number of features that need to be considered. when the process of reaching a solution to a problem involves many steps  analogy to a previous case can often reduce the number of steps required to reach a solution. furthermore  if the set of cases used in problem solving include 
those where errors had been detected and later fixed  then analogy to a previous case can not only help in recovering from similar errors  but also in avoiding similar failures in the future. 
　　　the problem solving process which solves problems by analogy to previous or hypothetical cases is a  case-based reasoning  process. application of previous experiences in problem solving is something people seem to do in areas as diverse as mathematics  physics  medicine  and law 
* this research has been supported in part by nsf grant nos. ist-1 and ist-1 and in part by the air force institute of technology. the views expressed are solely those of the authors.  e.g.  gick and holyoak  1; polya  1; reed and johnson  1; rissland  1 . it plays an especially important role in learning new tasks  e.g.  anderson  et a l . 1; ross  1   and is an important part of making predictions in understanding  schank  1  . 
　　　the example below illustrates several places where analogy to a previous case can help in understanding and solving a current one. 
	a reasoner 	reads 	about 	the 	sinai 	dispute 
 before the camp david accords . she is reminded of the korean war since both are over land  both are competitive  in neither can the conflict be resolved completely for both sides  and in both  military force had been used previous to negotiations. based on this reminding  she predicts that israel and egypt w i l l divide the sinai equally. 
　she later reads that this advice was given and rejected by both sides. she is reminded of her daughters' quarrel over an orange. she had suggested that they divide it equally  and they had rejected that  since one wanted to use the entire peel for a cake. realizing that she hadn't taken their real goals into account  she then suggested that they divide it agreeably by parts - one taking the peel  the other the f r u i t . this provides the suggestion that f a i l ures may occur because the goals of the disputants are misunderstood. she therefore attempts a reinterpretation of israel's and egypt's goals  and decides that israel wants the sinai as a military buffer zone in support of national security  and egypt wants the land back for national integrity. further reasoning aided by analogy to the orange dispute leads to the conclusion that an  agreeable division  based on the real goals of the disputants is appropriate. 
　she is reminded of the panama canal dispute since the disputants  disputed object  participant goals  and selected resolution plan are similar to those in the current dispute. analogy to that incident guides refinement of the  agreeable division  plan. replacing the us by israel  the party currently in control of the object  and panama by egypt  the party who used to own it and wants it back   she predicts that egypt w i l l get economic and p o l i t i c a l control of the sinai  while its normal right of 
military control w i l l be denied. 
as the example shows  case-based reasoning can aid in i n i t i a l understanding of a problem; in generation of solutions; and in cases of misunderstanding or plan failure  in reinterpretation and selection of alternate lines of reasoning. a problem solver must have several capabilities to employ case-based reasoning. it must locate previous similar cases in a potentially large long term memory of past problem solving episodes. it must integrate new cases into memory for future use. it must determine whether or not a recalled case is applicable in solving the new problem  and if many previous cases are available  which are potentially the most applicable. finally  it must transfer knowledge correctly from the previous case to the current one. 
　　　much work is being done currently in the area of making analogies across domains  e.g.  burstein  1; centner  1; winston  1   mostly for making automatic knowledge acquisition of a new domain easier. in general  the analogous concept is given and the computer's job is to do the tran-
sfer correctly. our goals are somewhat different. though analogy to a previous similar case results in acquisition of new or more refined knowledge in a domain the system already knows about  we focus on analogy's roles during problem solving. we thus consider the requirements it places on the problem solving system and the constraints put on the analogical process by the task demands of the problem solver. since we investigate a process that is meant to be part of a problem solver  we require that the computer locate  choose  and figure out how to apply appropriate analogies by i t s e l f . 
	ii the case-based 	reasoning 	process 
　　　the case-based reasoning process works as f o l lows:  1  locate and retrieve potentially ap-
plicable cases from long term memory.  1  evaluate selected cases to determine the applicable ones. 
  1  transfer knowledge from the old case  s  to the current one. we begin by explaining memory structures and processes that allow previous cases to be remembered. we then consider the roles those cases can play in problem solving and how problem solver task domains guide transfer of knowledge from one case to another. we consider the types of memory schemata necessary to support our model  and the choice of cases when several are available. finally  we present our program  the mediator  which uses analogy to previous cases to resolve disputes. for more information about other aspects of the process  see  kolodner & simpson  1 or 
simpson  1   
	iil. 	locating cases in memory 
　　　in order to use previous experience  a problem solver must be able to interact with a memory for experience  kolodner & simpson  1  . the memory we use organizes experiences  cases  based on generalized episodes  kolodner  1  schank  1 . these structures hold generalized knowledge describing a class of similar episodes. an individual experience is indexed by features which differentiate it from the norms of the class  those features which can differentiate it from other similar experiences . as a new experience is integrated into memory  it collides with other experiences in the same generalized episode which share its differences. we call such a collision a  reminding   kolodner  1  schank  1 . this triggers two processes. expectations based on the f i r s t episode can be used in analysis of the new 
	j. kolodneretal. 	1 
one  analogy . similarities between the two episodes can be compiled to form a new memory schema with the structure just described 
 generalization . 
　　　figure 1 shows how the  orange dispute   from the example above  is organized in a generalized episode associated with  physical disputes    i . e .   those over possession of a physical object . at the top of the figure are the norms for  physical disputes.  below that  the  orange dispute  is indexed by those features which specialize it in the  physical dispute  generalized episode. it is indexed by features of both of its interpretations. as new cases are added to the memory structure  sub categories w i l l be created in the structure at the places in which other cases correspond to this one. the  orange dispute  will help form the basis of norms associated with those categories. 
　　　retrieval of cases from memory and integration of new cases into memory are accomplished through a traversal process. as a new case is processed  appropriate generalized episodes are identified. features differentiating the new case from others organized in the same category are used to create new indices. indices associated with features already present in the indexing structure are traversed. any previous cases the new case collides with are available for further evaluation. a previous experience can thus be  remembered  if it is organized in the same generalized episode a new case is being integrated into and also shares a set of differences with that case. the  orange dispute  can be recalled from the  physical disputes  generalized episode shown above by any physical dispute for which  divide equally  f a i l s  e.g.  the sinai dispute   any time the object of dispute is edible  etc. 
　　　memory processes are integrated with problem solving processes as follows: as a case is being considered  it is represented by a set of schemata  frames  which detail features of the case  in the slot f i l l e r s   . at any moment  memory has available to it the current problem representation. a memory traversal process running concurrently with problem solving processes uses the current problem representation as a key into memory. cases the memory encounters in traversing memory using the current case as its search key are available for case-based reasoning. as the problem representation changes  search is directed to places in memory referenced by the most current problem representation. 
	iv. 	case-based reasoning's varied roles 
　　　before discussing the roles case based reasoning can play in problem solving  we need to duscuss the problem solving framework into which we enter our case based processes. in order to use case-based reasoning  a problem solver must be able to receive and evaluate feedback about the results of its decisions. a problem solver that suggests solutions to problems but never knows the outcome of its advice has no basis for evaluating its decisions  and thus cannot be expected to use its experience reliably in dealing with later cases. this suggests that the problem solver must have follow-up procedures  including procedures for recognizing  explaining  assigning blame  and attempting to correct failures. in addition to that and plan generation procedures normally included in 

1 j. kolodneretal. 
problem solvers  we also include a problem understanding phase in which a partially-specified problem description is elaborated to the extent necessary for problem resolution. these processes are depicted in figure 1. case-based reasoning can play a role in any of these tasks. 
physical disputes 


a. case-based reasoning 	in 	i nterpretation 
　　　before a problem can be solved  it must be understood. details not presented in the problem description must be f i l l e d in through inference or query  and schemata  generalized episodes  for representing the problem must be chosen. problem schemata point to potential solution plans and thus are crucial to deriving good solutions. analogy to a previous case can direct these processes in the following two ways: 
1. by suggesting additional 	features 	to 	be investigated 
1. by suggesting alternative interpretations 
　　　the f i r s t step in understanding a problem is to make a hypothesis about a schema that might describe the problem. a doctor  for example  may make a hypothesis about the disorder a patient has by focussing on reported symptoms. after representation hypotheses are made  case-based reasoning can help in verifying them. an attempt is made to integrate the new case into the hypothesized generalized episodes  causing remindings. if the current case is missing details necessary to verify a hypothesized schema  and a remembered case incl-
udes those details  an attempt is made to transfer those details to the current case. if their assumption is consistent with the current case  they are f i l l e d in  and the relevant hypothesis  the schema associated with the remembered case  is v e r i f i e d . a case one is reminded of may also have had features important to its proper resolution that were not predicted by the schema. these features are investigated. on the other hand  traversal may result in reminding of a case that i n i t i a l l y was thought to be represented by the hypothesized schema  but was later found to need a different representation. in this situation  the current case is evaluated to see whether it might also be represented the second way  thus avoiding the previous interpretation error. 
b. case-based reasoni ng in plan generation 
　　　after a case is understood  a plan for its resolution must be generated. our approach  which we refer to as plan instantiation  consists of two major stages: plan selection and plan refinement. plan selection involves choosing the best from among a set of known plans or constructing a plan by combining appropriate pieces of known plans. plan refinement involves role binding and adjusting the plan for the particular situation. when several plans are feasible  the expected results of using the plan must be generated and evaluated to choose the best one. analogy to previous cases can help plan generation in four ways: 
1. suggestion of procedures to be followed 
1. suggestion of procedures to be avoided 
1. selection of a 	means 	of 	implementing 	a plan 
1. prediction 	of 	the 	outcome of a selected plan 
plans associated with cases remembered 	during interpretation are available to suggest plans to be 
followed or avoided. the preconditions of any successful plan are checked  and if applicable  the plan is attempted. at the same time  any plan used 
in a previous case 	and 	r e s u l t i n g 	in 	f a i l u r e 	is 
p r o h i b i t e d 	in the c u r r e n t case. 
       if more than one plan is suggested  the u t i l i t y of p o t e n t i a l plans must be evaluated and the most a p p r o p r i a t e one chosen. plan e v a l u a t i o n involves s i m u l a t i n g the r e s u l t s of a l t e r n a t i v e 
courses of a c t i o n and evaluating them. evaluation can be done taking previous experiences i n t o account. simulating the r e s u l t s of using a plan provides a h y p o t h e t i c a l s i t u a t i o n which may be. s i m i l a r to a previous real one. the r e s u l t s of previous attempts at implementing the same plan under s i m i l a r c o n d i t i o n s provide a way of e v a l uating a p o t e n t i a l course of a c t i o n . a d d i t i o n a l information leading to a better s t r a t e g y may also be provided during e v a l u a t i o n . this process is an extension of what schank  1  r e f e r s to as i n t e n t i o n a l reminding  and is a component of wilensky's  1  p r o j e c t o r . 
       any chosen plan must be r e f i n e d or adjusted for the c u r r e n t s i t u a t i o n . a s u i t a b l e plan implementation can be derived by considering now it was e f f e c t e d in a previous case. we see t h i s in the sinai example when the panama canal agreement is used in deciding how to carry out the   d i v i d e 
agreeably  	p l a n . 
c. 	case based reasoning i n error recovery 
       problem s o l v i n g e r r o r s usually appear as 	plan f a i l u r e s   	but 	they can r e s u l t from i n i t i a l m i s i n t e r p r e t a t i o n   	poor 	implementation 	of 	the 	p l a n   i n c o r r e c t p r e d i c t i o n of 	the r e s u l t s   	new unexpected 
occurrences  or bad plan s e l e c t i o n . 	when s i m i l a r 
f a i l u r e s have happened p r e v i o u s l y   the work involved in e r r o r recovery can be cut down. in a 
sense  e r r o r recovery can be viewed as another i n s tance of problem s o l v i n g   t h i s time i n t e r p r e t i n g 
the f a i l u r e  explaining i t   and f i x i n g the f a u l t y knowledge  remediation . a previous case can thus play roles s i m i l a r to those played in i n i t i a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n and p l a n n i n g : 
1. suggestion of an explanation for the f a i l u r e 
1. suggestion of a plausable new 	i n t e r p r e t a t i o n 
1. suggestion of a plan for recovery 
       the procedure by which a previous s i m i l a r f a i l u r e may provide a clue to t r a c k i n g down the e r r o r in the c u r r e n t case is as f o l l o w s : upon f a i l u r e r e c o g n i t i o n   the reasoner w i l l f i r s t a t tempt to r e c a l l a s i m i l a r previous e r r o r . indices corresponding to the features of the case  the chosen plan and the f a i l u r e   are t r a v e r s e d . if a s i m i l a r f a i l u r e has occurred p r e v i o u s l y   the exp l a n a t i o n from t h a t f a i l u r e acts as a guide to cons t r u c t i n g a hypothesis to e x p l a i n the current f a i l u r e . the reminding may also include suggested plans for e r r o r recovery. 
	consider 	again 	our 	example 	in section one. 
the e r r o r recovery that occurs a f t e r the mother's f a i l u r e to c o r r e c t l y p r e d i c t a s o l u t i o n to the sinai d i s p u t e is as f o l l o w s : the mother remembers her previous f a i l u r e w i t h respect to the orange d i s p u t e . this reminding guides the c o n s t r u c t i o n of the f o l l o w i n g hypothesis: perhaps the goals of the 
d i s p u t a n t s have been i n f e r r e d i n c o r r e c t l y . if so  use  agreeable d i v i s i o n   based on t h e i r real g o a l s . 
j. kolodner et al. 1 
in t h i s case  an a l t e r n a t e c l a s s i f i c a t i o n is suggested  one based on concordant rather than comp e t i t i v e g o a l s     an explanation for the f a i l u r e is suggested  the wrong goals were being c o n s i d e r e d     and a plan for recovery is suggested   f i n d the real goals and apply the plan  agreeable d i v i s i o n     . 
v. guiding the transfer 1f knowledge 
       t r e a t i n g analogy as part of a problem s o l v i n g process allows task demands of the problem solver to guide the t r a n s f e r of knowledge from one case to another one. during i n t e r p r e t a t i o n   the problem solver needs to i n f e r missing information and to choose problem c l a s s i f i c a t i o n s . when i n f e r r i n g 
       missing i n f o r m a t i o n   it looks at those features of a previous case designated by the hypothesized generalized episode as necessary for c l a s -
s i f i c a t i o n . when enough information to make a d e f i n i t i v e c l a s s i f i c a t i o n i s a v a i l a b l e   the problem solver attempts to t r a n s f e r the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n   checking to make sure that c o n d i t i o n s for r e c o g n i t i o n are met. during plan generation  the problem solver attempts to transfer plans associated w i t h previous cases. to decide if a p a r t i c u l a r plan can be t r a n s f e r r e d   i t s preconditions are checked against the features of the c u r r e n t case. error recovery involves f a i l u r e c l a s s i f i c a t i o n and then r e p l a n n i n g . missing information about the f a i l u r e 
necessary to c l a s s i f y and possibly e x p l a i n it is i n v e s t i g a t e d and t r a n s f e r r e d from a previous case. previous means of r e s o l v i n g the error   i . e .   the remediation plan  are checked during r e p l a n n i n g . preventing the inappropriate t r a n s f e r of knowledge is complementary to enabling i t s t r a n s f e r . knowledge t r a n s f e r is p r o h i b i t e d when it v i o l a t e s designated consistency c o n s t r a i n t s   e . g .   precond i t i o n s and exclusionary p r i n c i p l e s   . 
	vi.. 	memory schemata 
       there are two important issues to discuss w i t h respect to l o c a t i n g cases in memory: what kinds of indices are necessary  and what kinds of generalized episodes have proven useful  
       two types of features are used for i n d e x i n g : features of the case and features d e s c r i b i n g any f a i l u r e s encountered during analysis of a case. if blame is assigned for a f a i l u r e and a c o r r e c t i o n has been found  the case is indexed by those features which caused the f a i l u r e . when a second s i t u a t i o n w i t h those features is encountered  reminding of the f i r s t provides a means of a v o i d i n g f a i l u r e the second time. when blame has not been assigned  the features indexing the case by i t s d i f f e r e n c e s w i l l serve to d i r e c t reminding to a s i m i l a r case. though a p a r t i c u l a r procedure f o r avoiding f a i l u r e may not be found  the f a i l e d i n s tance w i l l a l e r t the reasoner of a p o t e n t i a l problem. these two types of indices a l l o w r e m i n ding of  1  cases which are s i m i l a r d e s c r i p t i v e l y to a current one and  1  those which f a i l e d s i m i l a r l y . 
　　　two types of generalized episodes have proven useful for case-based problem s o l v i n g : d e s c r i p t i v e and t a c t i c a l ones. d e s c r i p t i v e categories d e s c r i b e the types of problems the problem solver w i l l 
encounter. each s p e c i f i e s d e s c r i p t i v e f e a t u r e s and suggested remedies. in our problem s o l v i n g 
framework  two types of problems are d e a l t w i t h by the problem s o l v e r : domain problems and f a i l u r e s . generalized episodes corresponding to each of these 
1 j. kolodner et al. 
problem types are necessary. in the mediation domain  these include dispute types  e.g.  physical  economic  political  and types of mediation failures  e.g.   wrong goal inference    incorrect classification    wrong planning policy  . figure 1 shows some of the norms and applicable plans for  physical disputes.  similarly  the descriptive failure category  wrong goal inference  holds a normative description and specifies plans for inferring the right goal  e.g.   infer goal from resulting events  . descriptive categories are used during understanding tasks -problem interpretation and failure explanation. 
　　　tactical classifications of experience correspond to particular plans. they describe preconditions  implementation details  and expected results of plans  and organize cases in which the plan was used. in the mediation domain  we use tactical generalized episodes corresponding to mediation plans  e.g.   divide equally    divide into different parts   and remediation plans  i.e.  plans for recovery from particular planning errors  e.g.   change planning policy    infer goal from later actions  . tactical generalized episodes are 
used during the planning stages to determine 
whether a suggested plan is appropriate  using its preconditions   to find a means of implementing a plan  and to predict and evaluate the consequences of using a suggested plan. during error recovery  classifications associated with remediation plans help in creating new problem interpretations and selecting alternative resolution plans. 
	v i i . 	choosing the best case 
　　　in a richly indexed episodic memory  many remindings may occur during problem solving. while the memory structure constrains the possibilities to some extent  there must be a way of choosing potentially relevant previous cases from the set of reminding*. there are two ways to do t h i s . in the f i r s t method  the best case is chosen from the set of remindings through an  a p r i o r i   evaluation procedure  i.e.  one that takes only closeness of f i t to the current case into account. using this 
method  if the selection later proves to be inapplicable  e.g.  due to incompatible preconditions for the suggested plan   a second choice is made by the same evaluation procedure. this method is acceptable if failures are not expensive or irrecoverable. because  a p r i o r i   evaluation may not always be reliable  however  another method of choice must be used when more carefully thought-out solutions are necessary. in this case  an evaluation procedure is used to rank cases  and a set of highly-ranked ones are chosen. suggestions from each of the selected cases are considered  a plan is generated based on each one  the generated plans 
are evaluated  and a best plan is chosen. 
　　　since the mediation domain is one where failure has l i t t l e consequence  we use the f i r s t method. the best previous case is chosen using an evaluation procedure based on carbonell's  1  invariance hierarchy. priority is attached to different feature types. alternative cases are evaluated according to a series of elimination and ranking tests. our set of tests is as follows: 
1. eliminate those cases where the goal relationship is different from that in the current case. 
1. eliminate those where the derivation of the goal relationship is different from that of the current case. 
1. order the remaining cases by the following rankings: similar disputant argument   
similar disputants   similar disputed ob-
ject 
　　　consider how these work for the following example: 
the third-world and industrial nations both want rights to the minerals in the world's sea beds. it has already been decided that they w i l l be divided. neither side  however  trusts the other to divide the resources. 
suppose our reasoner were reminded of three 	cases: 
 1  two children fighting over a candy bar - the solution is  one cuts the other chooses    1  the dispute between israel and egypt over the sinai  and  1  the dispute between the us and russia over fishing rights off the us coast. using rule 1   1  is eliminated since it involves a concordant goal 
relationship rather than a competitive one. rule 1 eliminates  1  since the goals of the disputants are derived differently. in the current case  the goal is derived from the disputants' desire to control and use a consumable resource  while in  1   the goal derives from an intention to control a renewable resource. case  1  is chosen as most applicable  and an analogy based on the superficial similarities between the current case and case  1  
is eliminated. 
	vi i i. 	an example from the mediator 
	in 	the following example  we see the mediator 
  simpson  1  resolving the sinai dispute based on analogies to several disputes it already knows about. i n i t i a l l y   the mediator is told that egypt and israel both want physical control of the sinai  and that military means have been used previously to attempt to achieve that. in attempting to classify the dispute into one of its known dispute types  the mediator is reminded of two previous cases  the panama canal dispute and the korean conf l i c t . using its evaluation function  not explained here   it chooses the korean conflict as most applicable since it shares more important features. since that dispute doesn't help it further interpret the problem  it goes on to the planning phase and attempts to transfer the plan used successfully to resolve the korean conflict. it checks that plan's preconditions for app l i c a b i l i t y to the new case.

       though we have presented a framework for using case-based reasoning in problem s o l v i n g   we have not covered a l l parts of the process in t h i s paper. the problem solver must be able to keep track of attempted s o l u t i o n s so that it does not repeat bad attempts. it is also necessary to develop c r i t e r i a to evaluate the f e a s i b i l i t y of a case-based approach for any given problem. transfer must also be given more c o n s i d e r a t i o n . d i r e c t t r a n s f e r is o f t e n not enough. sometimes only part of a s o l u t i o n should be t r a n s f e r r e d   and o f t e n t r a n s f e r its e l f is a n a l o g i c a l . m u l t i p l e cases representing a 
       combination of analogies must also be considered in i n t e r p r e t i n g or c r e a t i n g a plan to solve a problem. m u l t i p l e cases may each provide parts of a s o l u t i o n which must then be pieced together. 
       this work derives from research in the c o g n i t i v e modelling of long term memory  kolodner  1  schank  1  and uses those t h e o r i e s as i t s b a s i s . at the same time  we maintain consistency w i t h relevant psychological work   e . g .   ross  1 . like hammond  1 . who also bases h i s work on those models  we provide a model of case based reasoning which integrates problem s o l v i n g   understanding and memory. while his work uses previous cases for plan s e l e c t i o n and avoidance  we use them a d d i t i o n a l l y for problem i n t e r p r e t a t i o n and error recovery. carbone1  1  is c l o s e s t to our research  though his problem s o l v i n g f o l l o w s the search paradigm. in our approach  t r a d i t i o n a l notions of search are absent. rather  we combine analogical t r a n s f e r w i t h plan i n s t a n t i a t i o n .
