	ii b s s i c 	network 	notions 
       a semantic network c o n s i s t s of a c o l l e c t i o n of nodes and arcs where each node represents an o b j e c t   a p h y s i c a l o b j e c t   s i t u a t i o n   e v e n t   s e t   and each arc r e p r e s e n t s a b i n a r y r e l a t i o n . for example  in the net of figure 1  the node 'animals'   s i n g l e quotes d e l i m i t nodes  r e p r e s e n t s the set animals  the set of a l l a n i m a l s . l i k e w i s e   node 'dogs' represents the set of a l l dogs. the arc l a b e l e d   s   from 'dogs' to 'animals' i n d i c a t e s t h a t dogs is a subset of animals. the e arc from node 'fido* to node 'dogs' i n d i c a t e s t h a t fido is an element of set dogs and hence t h a t fi1 is some p a r t i c u l a r dog. node 'h* encodes an owning s i t u a t i o n   an element of the s i t u a t i o n set  own . i n p a r t i c u l a r   ' h ' represents the ownership of the dog fido by boy elmo from time t l u n t i l t 1 . these components o f s i t u a t i o n h are a s s o c i a t e d w i t h ' h ' through a r c s . for example  the arc l a b e l e d  ownee  from ' h ' to 'fido' i n d i c a t e s t h a t fido is the # ownee of s i t u a t i o n h  where the n o t a t i o n  # ownee of h  means the value  #  of the ownee a t t r i b u t e     o f h. 
       the 	idea of net 	p a r t i t i o n i n g 	is 	to separate the 	v a r i o u s 	nodes and arcs 	i n t o u n i t s c a l l e d spaces so t h a t every node and arc 	is assigned to e x a c t l y one space and a l l nodes and arcs l y i n g in 	the same space are d i s t i n g u i s h a b l e 
       from those of o t h e r spaces. 	nodes and arcs of d i f f e r e n t spaces may be l i n k e d   	but 	the l i n k a g e must 	pass through 	  b o u n d a r i e s   which separate one space 	from another. 	it 	is 	p o s s i b l e t h a t a node 	  a r c   may 	l i e in a d i f f e r e n t space from any of 	i t s a s s o c i a t e d arcs 	 nodes . 
       o r d i n a r i l y   	spaces 	are used 	f o r such p u r poses as d e l i m i t i n g the scopes of q u a n t i f i e d v a r i a b l e s - 	however  	before t a k i n g up such p r a c t i c a l 	a p p l i c a t i o n s   	c o n s i d e r 	the s i m p l e r   i f a t y p i c a l   	p a r t i t i o n i n g shown 	i n figure 1 . each space 	is enclosed w i t h i n a d o t t e d 	l i n e . for example  	space sa is at the t o p 	of 	the f i g u r e and i n c l u d e s nodes 	'animals'  	'dogs'  '   l i v e - o n   ' 	and 	'fleas'. 	sa a l s o i n c l u d e s the two s arcs 	    s u b s e t     	which 	i n d i c a t e 	t h a t 	set dogs and set fleas are subsets of animals. d i a g r a m m a t i c a l l y   	an arc belongs to a 	space 	if the a r c ' s 	l a b e l 	i s w r i t t e n w i t h i n the d o t t e d 
       l i n e boundaries of the space. 	thus the e arc     e l e m e n t     	from 	'ferdinand' 	to 	'fleas' 	l i e s 	in 
s1. 
       the v a r i o u s spaces of a p a r t i t i o n i n g are o r g a n i z e d i n t o a 	l a t t i c e such as 	in f i g u r e 1. viewing the semantic net 	from some p o i n t s 	in t h i s 	l a t t i c e   	only 	those nodes and arcs are v i s i b l e 	which l i e in s or in a space above s in the l a t t i c e . 	for example  	from space s1  o n l y those nodes and arcs l y i n g in s1 or sa are v i s i b l e . 	i n p a r t i c u l a r   	i t 	i s p o s s i b l e 	t o see t h a t fido is a dog and t h a t dogs are animals  but 	it 	is 	not 	p o s s i b l e 	to see 	t h a t 	ferdinand is a flea. 	from s1  i n f o r m a t i o n in s1  s1  s1  and sa is v i s i b l e . 	hence  	from s1  	the whole of the net of f i g u r e 1 may be seen. 	 a space l a t t i c e always has a s p e c i a l top space sa and a s p e c i a l bottom space sz. 	i n f o r m a t i o n encoded i n s a i s v i s i b l e from a l l spaces w h i l e the t o t a l net 	i s 	v i s i b l e 	from sz.  	p a r t i t i o n e d networks are c o n s t r u c t e d by c r e a t i n g empty net spaces  adding them to the l a t t i c e   	and then c r e a t i n g nodes and arcs w i t h i n each newly c r e a t e d space. 
iv.using p a r t i t i o n 	spaces 	to 	encode 	q u a n t f i i c a t i o n 
       a primary reason f o r imposing p a r t i t i o n i n g upon semantic nets is to d e l i m i t the scopes of q u a n t i f i e d v a r i a b l e s . i n c o n s i d e r i n g q u a n t i f i e d s t a t e m e n t s   i t w i l l b e h e l p f u l t o b u i l d upon t h e

 a dog 1  b i t a postman p   
encoded by the net of figure 1. 	nodes 'dogs'  ' bite ' 	and 'postmen' represent the sets of a l l dogs  b i t i n g events and postmen 	respectively. node 'd' with e arc to 'dogs' represents a part i c u l a r dog d. 	s i m i l a r l y   	'b' represents a p a r t i c u l a r b i t i n g event and ' p ' represents a 
p a r t i c u l a r postman. 	b  	l i k e other b i t i n g events  has an internal structure consisting of an # assailant  the value  #  of the b i t e ' s a s s a i l ant a t t r i b u t e d     and a # victim. 	the # assallant and # c victlm of b are d and p respectively.  note: 	time information has been deleted in t h i s and other examples for the sake of s i m p l i c i t y   but may be indicated in the network by including time arcs. 	a network treatment of time is discussed in hendrix  forthcoming .  
e x i s t e n t i a l 	quantification 
　　　the example  a dog d b i t a postman p  may be paraphrased as  there exists a dog d and a postman p such that d b i t p  which resembles the predicate calculus statement 

 in predicate calculus  dog d and postman p are represented as objects while the b i t i n g event is expressed by a predicate. but the b i t i n g event is a situation which might be the object of some more complex event such as a  wanting  as in section vi below . considering the b i t i n g event to be j u s t as much an object as the dog and postman  the example sentence may be paraphrased as  there exists a dog d and a postman p and a b i t i n g event b. further  the follow-
ing relationships e x i s t :  d is the # assailant 
of b   and  p is the #  victim of b .  
　　　following t h i s paraphrase  the presence of each node and arc w i t h i n space sa may be i n t e r preted as an i m p l i c i t statement of existence. thus  the nodes in figure 1 assert that there exist objects dogs   blte   postmen  d  b and p. the arcs assert that there exist relationships 
 d ε dogs    b ε  bltev    p ε pos1men*    d is the # c assailant of b   and  p is the # victim of 
b . 
universal 	quantification 
　　　while  a dog b i t a postman  asserts the occurrence of only one event  a universally quantified statement such as 
 every dog has b i t t e n a postman  
asserts the existence of many separate events. further  the statement indicates how the several events follow one recurring pattern. an a b i l i t y to encode universally quantified statements is of considerable importance since it is often impractical  or impossible  to record the same information by a c o l l e c t i o n of individual e x p l i c i t statements because of the very number  possibly i n f i n i t e   of statements required. 
　　　using p a r t i t i o n i n g   	the statement above is encoded by the net of figure 1. 	node 'gs'  a node especially known to u t i l i t y routines  represents the set of a l l general statements  the set of statements involving universal q u a n t i f i e r s or  under another i n t e r p r e t a t i o n   the set of recurring patterns of events.  node 'g * represents the p a r t i c u l a r statement  set of events  cited above. thus  g is the fact that  every dog has b i t t e n a postman.  
　　　c h a r a c t e r i s t i c a l l y   a general statement encodes a c o l l e c t i o n of separate situations a l l of which follow the same basic pattern. this pattern is represented by the # form of the general statement. the # form of g is encoded by space s i   which l i e s just below sa in the l a t t i c e . s1 is regarded as a super-node containing i t s own internal structure and representing 
a composite variable that takes on a d i f f e r e n t value for each i n s t a n t i a t i o n of the recurring pattern. each node and arc within s1 is regarded as a subvariable. 
　　　general statements are also t y p i c a l l y associated with universally quantified variables that assume values from some specified range. statement g has a universally quantlfled variable d given by i t s  vv a t t r i b u t e . note that variable d is necessarily a part of the # aform of g   i . e .   *d' l i e s in space s1 . from *d* there is an e arc to 'dogs* indicating that the value of d   w r i t t e n #d  must be taken from the range set dogs. 
　　　the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of a general statement is that for each assignment of the variables # wv to values in t h e i r corresponding ranges  there exist e n t i t i e s matching the structure of the # form. for g this means that for every #d ε dogs there exist #b Εf   b i t e     #p ε postmen and the r e l a t i o n s  #d is the # assailant of #b  and  #p is the # victim of #b- . in p a r t i c u l a r   if d assumes the value d  and p  a function of d  assumes the value p  then the # form of g assumes as i t s value roughly the net of figure 1. 
       it is useful to think of the space which encodes a #$ form as representing a hypothetical world which is mapped i n t o r e a l i t y for each assignment of values to the # vv variables. that i s   for each assignment of the *wv variables  there exists a  copy  of the # form in r e a l i t y . 
　　　the space encoding the #$ form serves to delimit the scope of the statement's universally quantified variables. although other methods for indicating scopes w i t h i n nets have been used   e . g .   shapiro t l 1 l l     spaces are p a r t i c u l a r l y well suited to this purpose in that the node and arc variables encoding information w i t h i n a # form look exactly l i k e the representations of specific f a c t s . more importantly  such v a r i ables are e f f e c t i v e l y isolated from   r e a l   information by p a r t i t i o n boundaries  section v . without p a r t i t i o n s   variables may become confused with the values they represent unless cumbersome markers   i n the form of modified arc and node labels  special flags or extra s t r u c t u r a l arcs  are added to the net as preventatives.

e x i s t s a c o n s t a b l e who has been b i t t e n by every dog in t o w n     . in f i g u r e 1  the b i t t e n postman is a  skolem  f u n c t i o n of the b i t i n g dog. hence  the postman is encoded by a node 'p' l y i n g in the #! form of g. this puts p  and  in g e n e r a l   any v a r i a b l e l y i n g i n the #$ form  w i t h i n the scope o f the u n i v e r s a l q u a n t i f i e r . i n c o n t r a s t   the c o n s t a b l e c of f i g u r e 1 is encoded by node 'c' l y i n g o u t s i d e the # form of g * . hence  a l l the b i t i n g events i n v o l v e the same c o n s t a b l e c. the v i c t i m arc remains w i t h i n the scope s i n c e each b i t i n g is a s s o c i a t e d w i t h a d i f f e r e n t i n s t a n c e of the v i c t i m r e l a t i o n between a  new  b i t i n g and the  one  c o n s t a b l e . 
       as a second v a r i a t i o n   c o n s i d e r  every dog has b i t t e n every p o s t m a n     encoded by the net of f i g u r e 1. this statement i n v o l v e s two u n i v e r s a l l y q u a n t i f i e d v a r i a b l e s d and p. for each c o m b i n a t i o n of value assignments to d and p  t h e r e e x i s t s a b i t i n g event ffb whose #   a s s a i l a n t is the value of d  #d  and whose #   w v l c t i m is #p.

	v i i . 	all existing system 
       partitioned semantic networks of the kind described above have been implemented for the speech understanding system being developed j o i n t ly by sri and sdc  see walker  1 j . as an ap-
p l i c a t i o n of the quantified statements discussed above  the speech system uses spaces to encode rules d e f i n i n g categories of objects. 	the taxon-
omic system based on these categories compresses redundant information by recording common data at the category level rather than w i t h each i n d i v i dual . those network category rules which define the a t t r i b u t e values associated w i t h various verb classes aid the t r a n s l a t i o n routines by providing information needed to determine if a parse is semantlcally well formed and to associate surface structures with t h e i r corresponding network representations. 
　　　the speech understanding system also uses spaces to maintain alternative parsings and in focusing the system's attention on a p a r t i c u l a r portion  context  of the semantic network for discourse analysis.

　　　a number of modern computer languages  exemplified by qlisp  reboh    have data base maintenance f a c i l i t i e s with b u i l t - i n mechanisms for p a r t i t i o n i n g data into  contexts.  however  a l l such systems which are known to the author are based on assertional representations as opposed to networks. the context hierarchies of these systems are s t r i c t l y t r e e - l i k e and are not allowed to form l a t t i c e s . further  the cont e x t f a c i l i t y of these systems has neither been exploited as a tool for implementing q u a n t i f i c a t i o n nor been used in event descriptions for encoding the objects of such actions as wanting and dreaming.
