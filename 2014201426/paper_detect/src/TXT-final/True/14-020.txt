 
a method f o r structure from motion is presented. the method makes a motion assumption about the objects being viewed. the motion assumption is that a l l motion consists of t r a n s l a t i o n s and rotat i o n s about a fixed a x i s . p a r a l l e l projection is also assumed. this makes it possible to i n t e r p r e t the motion of as few as two r i g i d l y connected points. the method works f o r both r i g i d and jointed objects. results of a test of t h i s method on johansson's data are presented. 
1. 	introduction 
　　　human beings have many sources of information on depth that do not depend on stereo v i s i o n . these include motion parallax  shape from shading  and textural information. these sources of depth information are p a r t i c u l a r l y i n t e r e s t i n g for computer applications because they require the use of only one camera. moreover  there are many s i t u a t i o n s where stereo algorithms are d i f f i c u l t to use  so that the a v a i l a b i l i t y of other sources of depth information is h e l p f u l . the present i n v e s t i g a t i o n is also motivated for psychological reasons. as computational methods are proposed f o r solving problems that human v i s i o n also solves these 
methods can be compared with human methods  hopef u l l y leading to insights in human visual processes. 
　　　this paper addresses a method for recovering structure   i . e .   depth information  by observing the motion of objects in the image plane. the 
method assumes that the objects are reasonably d i s tant from the observer  so that perspective effects are small and the objects can be treated as if they were seen in p a r a l l e l p r o j e c t i o n . this process is called s t r u c t u r e from motion  a f t e r ullman   1   1   . 
　　　previous work in t h i s area has been of two kinds: psychological studies i n v e s t i g a t i n g human a b i l i t y in t h i s process  and computational

investigations studying how structure can be recovered from camera images. the psychological research is reviewed in section 1; here it w i l l only be mentioned that human beings can recover structure purely from observing the image plane positions of points. human beings can recover the structure of as few as two connected points moving in space. 
　　　computational studies have investigated two kinds of objects: r i g i d objects with several v i s i ble points  and jointed objects with two v i s i b l e points on esch r i g i d part. the studies of jointed objects were stimulated by some experiments by johansson   1 - 1     who showed subjects movies of people moving around dark rooms with l i g h t s on t h e i r major j o i n t s   so that there were two points on each r i g i d part. subjects had no d i f f i c u l t y c o r r e c t l y i n t e r p r e t i n g the movies. these studies w i l l be reviewed b r i e f l y here  since a more detailed discussion is a v a i l a b l e in   1   . 
　　　ullman  1 1  proved that it was possible to recover the structure of several points on a r i g i d object given several accurate two-dimensional views of the points. roach and aggarwal   l 1   obtained s i m i l a r results in the case of central  perspect i v e   p r o j e c t i o n . one problem with t h i s method was i t s s e n s i t i v i t y to noise. another problem was the i n a b i l i t y to explain human a b i l i t y in recovering the structure of as few as two connected points. the assumptions used by these researchers are not strong enough to allow the recovery of structure in t h i s case. 
　　　several attempts have been made to recover the structure of jointed objects l i k e those studied by johansson. clocksin   1   and raahid  used h e u r i s t i c methods to recover the connectedness s t r u c t u r e . o'rourke and badler  used a known human figure to guide recovery of three-dimensional s t r u c t u r e . hoffman and flinchbaugh   1   used the assumption of motion p l a n a r i t y to guide recovery of both the connectedness structure and the threedimensional s t r u c t u r e . this p l a n a r i t y assumption is a special case of the assumption used here. 
　　　the present research attempts to unify the recovery of the structure of johansson-type   j o i n t e d   figures and r i g i d objects. this is done by adding the fixed axis assumption: a l l movement consists of t r a n s l a t i o n s and rotations about a fixed axis. this assumption makes it possible to recover the structure of as few as two r i g i d l y

connected points. the fixed axis assumption also gives a criterion which can be used to decide whether two points are connected  so that both the connectedness structure and the three-dimensional structure of johansson-type figures can be recovered. 
　　　the algorithm for the recovery of the structure of rigid and jointed objects is developed in the next section. an experiment testing perfor-
mance on johansson's data is presented in section 1. psychological implications are discussed in section 1. 
	1. 	rigid and jointed objects 
　　　an algorithm for recovering the structure of rigid and jointed objects is developed in this section. first the fixed axis assumption is justified on the basis of everyday observations of movement. then it is proved that the fixed axis assumption makes possible the recovery of the structure of any group of rigidly connected points. the algorithm for the recovery of structure is developed at the same time. the algorithm is then extended to jointed objects. the development for jointed objects is brief because a more complete development is available in . 
　　　many natural and man-made objects move in ways that tend to satisfy the fixed axis assumption. objects that move with a fixed orientation to a plane must satisfy the assumption  because only planar rotations are possible  so that the axis must point out from the plane. the bodies of automobiles are an example of this. objects that move through the air  such as frisbees and maple seeds  tend to satisfy the fixed axis assumption because they rotate rapidly around a fixed axis to maintain stability. 
　　　jointed objects also often satisfy this assumption. many animal locomotive systems use fixed axis movements extensively. for example  the walking motion of humans involves rotations about a line roughly perpendicular to the line of travel and parallel to the plane the human walks on. at the same time  the person's arms rotate about an axis parallel to this line. many gymnastics movements consist of rotations about a fixed axis. for reasons of simplicity  much machine design is based on planar translations and rotations. for example  the wheels on a car rotate rapidly about a fixed axis. 
　　　using the fixed axis assumption  it is shown that any rigid object satisfying it has the following property: fixing any point on the object causes the other points to trace out circles in planes normal to a fixed axis. under parallel projection  these circles project onto ellipses in the image plane. .the orientation of each circle  and hence the structure of the rigid object  can be recovered to within a reflection by finding the equations describing the ellipses. 
　　　first it is shown that fixing any point on the rigid object in space reduces the motion of any

however  performance does not improve s i g n i f i c a n t l y when there are several points on the r i g i d object; the equations developed do not take advantage of useful constraints on the r e l a t i v e notions of the points in space. equations  1  and  1  do not require the object to be t r u l y r i g i d ; each point can move independently of the others  though each must trace out a c i r c l e in a plane normal to the axis o f r o t a t i o n . 
　　　now the algorithm for jointed objects w i l l be developed. the f i r s t step in the algorithm applies the r i g i d part algorithm to the image  testing every point as a reference point. this divides the image into r i g i d parts  and determines the threedimensional structure of each part. next the jointed objects have to be b u i l t up out of these p a r t s . 
　　　joints that are seen   i . e .   j o i n t s with feature points  are i d e n t i f i a b l e as j o i n t s because the feature points corresponding to them belong to more than one r i g i d part. once a seen j o i n t is found  the structure of the two r i g i d parts it connects must be found. the r i g i d part algorithm f i n d s two r e f l e c t i o n s of each r i g i d part. each r e f l e c t i o n makes a d i f f e r e n t prediction about the p o s i t i o n of the j o i n t . when the two r i g i d parts are put together  the predicted positions must be consistent  so that each r e f l e c t i o n of a r i g i d part is consistent with only one r e f l e c t i o n of the other r i g i d p a r t . this means that when the two r i g i d parts are put together there are only two v a l i d 
　　　r e f l e c t i o n s of the two r i g i d parts together. for example  in a side view of a walking human each of the four limbs consists of two r i g i d parts. each r i g i d part has two i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s as given by the r i g i d part algorithm  so that there would be 1 i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s of the limbs of the body. however  when the predicted positions of the j o i n t s are resolved  the 1 interpretations would be reduced to 1  since each limb has two i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s . 
　　　the jointed object can s t i l l be assembled if the joints are not seen. once the r i g i d part algorithm has analysed the structure of the r i g i d p a r t s   the r e l a t i v e positions of the points and the d i r e c t i o n of the axis of r o t a t i o n are known. the p o s i t i o n of the joint   i f it exists  can then be expressed r e l a t i v e to the reference point as a l i n e a r combination of a vector from the reference point to any other point  a vector in the d i r e c t i o n of the axis of r o t a t i o n   and the cross product of these two vectors. these positions can be resolved f o r any two r i g i d parts using least-squares minimisation of a l i n e a r form  and then the residual e r r o r can be examined to see if it is reasonable to suppose that a joint exists between the r i g i d pa r t s . 
　　　the algorithm for recovering structure of r i g i d and jointed objects begins by analysing the structure of a l l r i g i d parts in the scenes. then the j o i n t e d objects are assembled  in two d i f f e r e n t ways depending on whether the j o i n t s are seen or unseen. the r e s u l t is that the scene is analysed as a c o l l e c t i o n of r i g i d and jointed objects  with the structure of each being known to w i t h i n a scaling f a c t o r and a number of r e f l e c t i o n s . 
	1. 	experimental results 
　　　the structure from motion method developed in t h i s paper has been implemented and run on johansson'1  1  data. these data were obtained from a commercial f i l m made for educational purposes   1   . the data were encoded by hand using a numonics graphics data calculator. no threedimensional information was available for t h i s data. two sets of data with three-dimensional information were tested in  1 j. 
　　　the data is shown in figure 1 . six points were available: shoulder  elbow  w r i s t   h i p   knee  and ankle. twenty-one frames were analysed: since the f i l m speed twenty-four frames per second the time i n t e r v a l was j u s t under one second. 
　　　the connectedness structure found by thresholding the residual errors in the f i t s of the e l l i p s e s is shown in figure 1. the proposed structure seems p e r f e c t l y reasonable  since the shoulder and hip are not a single r i g i d part.  including the shoulder - hip connection would have forced the shoulder - w r i s t and hip - ankle connections  . 
　　　the r i g i d part lengths proposed by the algorithm are shown in table i. these r i g i d part lengths were calculated by assuming the maximal shoulder - ankle extension  as measured from the image plane view  was 1 f e e t . most of these lengths seem reasonable; clear exceptions are the shoulder - elbow and knee - ankle lengths. the algorithm seems to be recovering part of the structure of the object  but the results are not good enough to be used for three-dimensional structure analysis. 
　　　this section has reported the results of an experiment t e s t i n g the behavior of the algorithm on johansson's data. the connectedness structure recovered is reasonable. the r i g i d part lengths inferred seem less so. 
	1. 	psychological implications 
　　　the previous sections have developed an algorithm that can recover structure from motion in many s i t u a t i o n s . in t h i s section the capacity of the algorithm to explain some aspects of human 
motion v i s i o n is examined. 
　　　the perception of depth by humans is a complicated process involving many independent sources of information  including stereo v i s i o n   perception of slant and t i l t   and motion parallax   1   . the present research addresses the perception of structure from motion of r i g i d and jointed structures under conditions where p a r a l l e l projection is a reasonable approximation of the camera conditions. 
　　　the perception of structure from motion under various kinds of t r a n s l a t i o n and r o t a t i o n has been a popular topic of psychological research in v i s i o n . johansson   l 1   c l e a r l y suggests the r o l e 
　　　p r o j e c t i v e geometry and r o t a t i o n may play in t h i s process. the f i r s t major study of t h i s phenomenon

was by wallaoh and 1*connall   1     who demonstrated what thay oallad tha   k i n e t i c dapth a f f a o t ' ' by showing subjects tha shadow of a r o t a t i n g wire f i g u r e . later white and mueeer   1   demonstrated that subjects could under some conditions recover three-dimensional structure accurately. 
　　　the present algorithm w i l l recover the correct three-dimensional structure when the objects 
observed do not t r s n s l s t e in depth and rotate about a fixed a x i s . this is consistent with human behavior as observed by several researchers and summsrised by braunstein   1   page 1 . if there is no r o t a t i o n or the axis of r o t a t i o n is perpend i c u l a r to the image plane  the algorithm cannot determine s t r u c t u r e . this is consistent with human motion v i s i o n   which sees planar motion in the second case  as observed by borjesson and von ho faten   1   . 
　　　rigidity-based algorithms  l i k e those of u l l man  1  1  and roach and aggarwal   1     predict a l i g h t l y d i f f e r e n t behavior: when there are only two points v i s i b l e   or in some cases a where the points observed are coplanar  the correct atructure cannot be determined. human motion v i a i o n does not have t h i a r e s t r i c t i o n   as noted in johanna son's experiments  1  esp. 1  and by borjesaon and von hofsten  1 j. 
　　　in some cases the algorithm predicts f a i l u r e in grouping into r i g i d parte. for example  in the case of tumbling motion the algorithm may not succeed in finding the correct grouping  ao that objects that are a c t u a l l y r i g i d would appear to be n o n - r i g i d . tumbling motion has been studied by green   1     who found that r i g i d i t y is less pronounced with tumbling than with simple r o t a t i o n . evidence on t h i a point ia still unclear; several f a c t o r s seem to influence the perception of r i g i d i t y   and tumbling motion has apparently been lnvestigated only by green. thia r e s u l t might be explained by a r i g i d i t y - b a s e d algorithm if the implementation of the algorithm made fixed axia motion easier to i n t e r p r e t   auch as in ullman's     i s     pp. 1  proposed implementation of his r i g i d i t y - b a s e d algorithm by an expert system in which each expert i n t e r p r e t a motion about a single a x i s . further experiments would aid understanding of human motion v i s i o n under these conditione. 
　　　the experimental results reported in the l a s t section suggest that the proposed algorithm can account f o r some aspects of human behavior in i n t e r p r e t i n g johansson-type f i g u r e s . it seems l i k e l y that some high-level knowledge ia used by humans in i n t e r p r e t i n g these images. one way of using t h i a knowledge has been lnveatlgated by 
o'rourke and badler   1   . another kind of higher el knowledge has been investigated by cutting   1   . thia research attempted to explain human a b i l i t y in determining gender from impoverished johansson-type figures   f o r example  subjects could determine gender with b e t t e r than chance accuracy even when only the ankles were seen . it may be 
that the fixed axis assumption can be incorporated in a useful way with h i g h - l e v e l type knowledge to aid i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of human movement. thia synthesis could be useful not only f o r understanding human visual processes  but also for aiding in the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of a t h l e t i c movement from monocular images   1   . 
　　　one kind of motion that the present algorithm cannot account f o r is motion involving s large depth component. i t s behavior in the presence of objects moving in depth w i l l depend on the r e l a t i v e amount a of motion in depth and r o t a t i o n . with a large r o t a t i o n component and a fast camera  the algorithm w i l l perform c o r r e c t l y . i f the r o t a t i o n component ia small  the algorithm w i l l s t i l l group the points c o r r e c t l y   but the structure w i l l not be recovered. the structure the algorithm assigns has the the other points swinging about the reference p o i n t . ullsan   1   observed t h i s i n t e r p r e t a t i o n in an experiment i n v o l v i n g the motion of a c y l i n d e r in depth. if the r o t a t i o n and depth motion components are s i m i l a r   the algorithm w i l l f a i l   which ia inconsistent with human behavior as noted by borjesaon and von hofaten   1   . 
　　　thia section has summerited the psychological implications of the present approach to motion v i a i o n . the present approach can account f o r several aspects of human behavior in motion v i a i o n . in a d d i t i o n   the preaent theory p r e d i c t s i n t e r e s t ing things in human a b i l i t y   auch as the d i f f i c u l t y in i n t e r p r e t i n g tumbling motion. the algorithm cannot account f o r the correct perception of simultaneous r o t a t i o n and t r a n s l a t i o n in depth.
