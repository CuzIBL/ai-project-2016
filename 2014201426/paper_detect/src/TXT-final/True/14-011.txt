	h 	accessibility 
     accessibility deals with the problem of gaining access to a propel set of 1d object representations based upon information extracted irom a 1d image it involves the representation of 1d shape information  the representation of 1d shape information  and the indexing paths available in the data base 
a structure ol visual knowledge 
     in the visions system |1| visual knowledge is collected in a layered network data base called long term memory  ltm  fach level of the network contains a single type of entity the entity types used for this work are schema  object  surface patch  .1d curve  region. 1d curve  vertex fach level is currently partitioned into four spaces where a space is merely a collection of entities the four spaces arc the  class  space  the  class feature  space  the  instance  space  and the  instance leature  space an example of a class entity at the object level is. say.  table  this entity is a prototype from which many instances may be constructed the instances may differ in a variety of ways consequently  separate leature spaces are maintained for classes and instances figure 1 is an example of a portion of the network structure of l t m the advantage of this network structure is that it provides a straightforward  logical view of the current structure of stored visual knowledge and the semantics of access to particular knowledge is easily described in terms of path

b. 1d representation 
     in the world of 1d scene analysis it is necessary to extract representations of 1d entities from digitized images our approach is to attempt to keep the 1d representation as close to the 1d representation as possible thus  the 1d digital curves which result from the segmentation of a digitized image are converted to cubic b-splinc representation a b-spline curve is filled to an image curve by analyzing the k curvature|1| of the 
image curve and placing knots along the digital curve at appropriate points. special algorithms have been developed lor knot placement and knot coalescing  the creation ol multiple knots  the fitting procedure is iterative first knots are placed .it points of high k-curvature  then knots are moved or coalesced according to a set of special heuristics  the cubic b-spline through the knots is computed  and a measure of error of lit is computed. ii the error is above some threshold  we iterate from the knot motion/coalescing step when the error is below threshold  the knot vector is converted to the corresponding vertex polygon and 1d shape features are computed. the special heuristics are based upon smoothness criteria such as the detection of corners or peaks  slope discontinuities  and the detection of  staircase  straight lines l o r more details see |1| 
     the algorithms for knot placement  knot motion  knot coalescing  b-spline compulation  and error compulation have been implemented currently the fitting procedure is interactively controlled with the user indicating the locations in the curve where a given special heuristic should be applied we would eventually like to develop a mechanism which has good performance without user intervention 
c 	indexing 
     a small l t m has been constructed containing ik single patch objects the graph representing this l t m contains approximately 1 nodes and 1 edges an indexing mechanism has been implemented in the  irasplr|1| graph processing language the mechanism provides lor execution of relational searches in the network an example of a relational search might be the query  find all curves which are closed and have angular variability = i.1  the current mechanism merely executes raw primitive queries on the 1d levels ol etm anding and oring ol the result sets is done interactively when all ol the primitive results are available 
     we have not. as yet. implemented  standard views'' correlation ol certain 1d shape features  such as av     lor standard views with the corresponding 1d features   a v 1   . will provide indexing paths from the 1d levels to the 1d levels figures    and 1 demonstrate the importance ol standard views and the change in 1d shape features with change in view four projections ol a cubic b-splinc approximation to a 1d circle and its associated vertex polygon are shown the circle is defined in 1-space even though it lies in a plane the plane ol the circle stalls out orthogonal to the line of sight and is rotated away from the viewer by the angular amounts indicated as the the circle is rotated  it projects as an ellipse of greater and greater eccentricity until finally it projects as a straight line. figure x shows certain 1d leature-values for rotations from 1' to 1 in the case ol the circle some of the 1d feature-values lor     arc equivalent to the 1d feature-values for the 1d circle irom such a table we can begin to correlate change in feature values with change in 
viewpoint ultimately we would like to develop correlations for more complex shapes
