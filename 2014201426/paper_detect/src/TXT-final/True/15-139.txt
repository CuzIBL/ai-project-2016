w a s . f i r s t b u i l t as part of the machine translation project in the computer science department of yale university in 1. it has been subsequently improved at etl in japan. about 1 stories are parsed into conceptual representations from spanish news-
paper stories lytinen and schank  1  and then japanese sentences are generated. 
	i 	introduction 
　　　input stories are extracted from spanish newspapers. a l l the stories concern terrorism and each consists of a few sentences. the parser analyzes them to obtain t h e i r conceptual representations by using appropriate mops and causal r e l a t i o n s among events in the s t o r i e s . about 1 stories are parsed i n t o conceptual representations and then japanese sentences are generated. 
ii japanese language structure 
the word order in japanese is somewhat d i f f e r ent from that in english. 	the main differences are 
  l   t h e verb is the l a s t element in a clause   1 negation is expressed by endings attached to the verb  1 adjectives and adverbs always precede t h e i r modi f i e d nouns  verbs and other words. 

　　　this is an attempt to generate japanese sentences from conceptual representation obtained from spanish newspaper stories   1   . this generator was f i r s t b u i l t as part of the machine translation project in the computer science department of yale university in the summer of 1. it has been subsequently improved at the electrotechnical laboratory in japan. 
　　　conceptual representation is based on the conceptual dependency theory and also on memory 
organization packets  mops . the general idea behind mops is to store knowledge which is common to many d i f f e r e n t s i t u a t i o n s in only one processing s t r u c t u r e   and then to make t h i s processing structure available for use in a v a r i e t y of appropriate s i t u a t i o n s . mops are useful for a japanese generat o r because t h e i r contents are independent from the language  although cd theory and mops are constructed by using english. such independency may be v e r i f i e d by applying these theories to japanese sentences  s t r u c t u r a l l y d i f f e r e n t from romance l a n guages  such as english  spanish and french. 
　　　this generator has several features. f i r s t   it i n f e r s the temporal order of events included in the conceptual representation using causal chains and mops. such inference is necessary to generate japanese sentences because most clauses and sentences are ordered temporally in japanese. second  approp r i a t e conjunctives are inserted between the events using t h e i r causal r e l a t i o n s . t h i r d   subjects are omitted in relevant situations and two case markers for subjects are used in the generator to make the sentences suitable for japanese. other features are described in the following sections. 
　　　the verb determines the structure of the sentence in japanese as w e l l as in english  although the verb is placed at the end of the sentence. the role of the verb is one of the reasons why cd theory is also e f f e c t i v e for japanese. 
　　　the most important difference between english and japanese is in the order of clauses  phrases  and sentences. in english  clause modifiers usually follow the modified word. but modifiers are never 
placed a f t e r the modified words in japanese. subordinate clauses are never placed a f t e r t h e i r main clauses. a l l the clauses are temporally ordered in japanese. the only exception is a goal clause. there are  of cource  exceptions in l i t e r a r y expressions but t h i s generator does not t r e a t them. 
i l l conceptual representation 
　　　the japanese generator s t a r t s from the concept u a l representation which the parser extracts from spanish newspaper s t o r i e s . for example  f i g . l shows a conceptual representation for story 1. fig.1 shows japanese sentences generated from the representation and t h e i r correspondence with english words. 
　　　each conceptual representation is expressed by a tree s t r u c t u r e . nodes of the tree are either nouns or events verbs . each node has i t s own concept. for example  event node exeo in f i g . l has execute as i t s concept. i t s actor is hum1  i t s obj e c t is hum1  and the place where the event occured is loco. ir-from is a causal relationship which means that und1 caused the event of exeo.

guy under control during the transportation. on the other hand  escape is the escl's concept and it has an antecedent  disable-cont. therefore  escape sati s f i e s the properties of disable-cont. after checking the correspondence between actor of trao and object of esc1 and also object of trao and actor of escl  the generator i n f e r s that the temporal order of the events should be trao  escl. the whole 
structure of story 1 thus becomes  trao t o k i   escl node  kil1 . 
b. event generation 
	an event is generated 	by the 	following func-
t i o n s   
	 gen-subject   	 gen-verb-modifiers   	 gen-verb . 
 gen-subject  picks up an actor s l o t from the event. the function chooses an object s l o t and the event is expressed in a passive form when the actor s l o t i s not f i l l e d . 
     a case marker  wa  usually follows a subject. another case marker  ga  is also used often for a subject. the difference between them is so subtle and highly semantic that it is not easy to t r e a t . roughly speaking   ga  is used in subordinate clauses which express time  reason  goal  etc. and  wa  is usually used in main clauses. this approxmation is adopted in t h i s generator. 
      gen-verb-modifiers  generates object and other modifiers for the verb. it has standard pairs of properties and case markers l i s t e d below    time ni   place de   from kara   to e   inst de   object o     . 
these modifiers for verbs are generated with t h i s order. a case marker must be specified at the verb's entry in the japanese dictionary when the property has another type of case markers. 
      gen-verb  generates a verb which is appropriately i n f l e c t e d according to the tense and the mode of the event. the tense i n f l e c t i o n of the verbs are specified according to t h e i r endings. 
c. noun phrase generation 
     a noun phrase is generated by the following functions when the noun is processed for the f i r s t time   gen-noun-modifiers    gen-noun . the second time a noun is needed  it is generated by  gen-pronoun . 
     for example  when criminal fidel gonzalez is generated f o r the f i r s t time   gen-pronoun  is used the next time. the function generates the criminal instead of pronoun  he . because in japanese  espec i a l l y in newspapers  pronouns corresponding to  he    she  etc. are r a r e l y used. there is a tendency to use more specific words shown above than such pronouns. 
     an order of the modifier generation for a noun is specified as  type number age name status etc. other modifiers not specified here are generated according to the order in the node representation and they precede these modifiers.

d. ellipses 
     subjects in main clauses are usually omitted when t h e i r subordinate clauses have the same subjects in japanese. in story 1 shown in f i g . 1  the subject and the object in event acc1 are same as those in trao. in the japanese t r a n s l a t i o n   not only is the subject omitted in trao  but also the object is as shown in f i g . 1 . an object is not omitted if the two events have no common subject. 
v conclusions 
     this generator works w e l l in t r a n s l a t i n g conceptual representation i n t o japanese sentences during the processing of 1 terrorism s t o r i e s . concept u a l representation is expressed to be language i n dependent if the culture or the customs behind the language are not very d i f f e r e n t from those of the representation. in those s t o r i e s   the mops are not changed for the generation. 
     the problem of 	focus is not 	discussed in t h i s paper. 	word order 	and nested structure 	should be taken i n t o account if t h i s problem 	is 	treated 	by the generator. but the temporal ordering of 	events and other methods 	proposed here are 	necessary for generation regardless of the focus problem.
