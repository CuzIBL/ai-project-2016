     we emphasize a top-down approach where verbalisations are processed in order to decide whether or not they properly describe a given image sequence. most related research efforts differ from our approach in that they derive verbalisations bottom-up. for example the work of badler  which is further developed by tsotsos  offers motion conceptualisations which can be generated from image sequences and permit a crude verbalisation by simple translation of concepts into words. similarily the systems of okada  or tsuji et.al.  do not attempt to relate truly natural language expressions to the analyzed movements. 
     in this contribution we discuss three types of constraints which can be extracted from yes/no questions. they form the basis for a process which tests whether or not the symbolic scene representation corresponds to the inquiry. verb tense and time adverbials give rise to a temporal constraint which is treated in the following section. the verb and its deep-case structure usually imply certain trajectory shapes. this includes the verb's manner of action which corresponds to trajectories satisfying particularly simple shape predicates. finally  an example is given where location constraints can be derived from the deep-case structure. 
	ii 	tense and time 
     dialogues in our system refer to a sequence of images covering a certain time span  tbeg tend . within these limits a time of speech ts can be arbitrarily chosen which synchronizes the dialogue with the scene. ts is fixed throughout the dialogue  although some notion of 
progressing dialogue time is maintained for the purpose of modelling dialogue context. the system cannot access referential knowledge beyond ts which marks the presence. 
　　we call the subsequence of images which has to be regarded to answer a question  the  time  interval of consideration. it is mainly determined by the tense of the verb and possibly time adverbials  but also by the domain  i.e. its typical motions  and the course of the dialogue   i . e . the current focus of attention . we only consider the effect of tense and adverbials  and begin with tense. for present tense questions the boundaries of the interval of consideration are given by the parameters tprl and tpr1 which denote a short time span immediately preceding ts. for present perfect and simple past the corresponding parameters are tpal and tpa1 which cover the scene from the beginning up to tprl. colloquial german does not necessitate a distinction between these tenses. 
     the effect of several time adverbials can be described as restricting the interval of consideration with respect to a time of reference. let the event 'bus stops in question  1  terminate at tbus1  then the time of consideration for question  1  extends from tbus1 to tpa1. adverbials which refer to a time of reference which is defined by some other event correspond to the category adve introduced by baeuerle . we have selected the following subset: 'vorher'  
'davor'  'dann'  'nachher'  'spaeter'  'danach'  'previously'  'before t h i s '   'then'  'afterwards'  'later'  'after t h a t '   . 
     other time adverbials specify the interval of consideration referring always to the time of speech as a special time of reference. they are summarized in the category advs. we only work with those adverbials of the category advs which put the interval of consideration close to the time of speech  namely ' j e t z t '   'nun'  'gerade'  'gegenwaertig'  'im moment'  'eben*  'soeben'  'now'  'at present'  ' j u s t '   'just at the moment'  'just now' . this excludes adverbials like 'kuerzlich'  'recently* . 
	i l l 	locomotion verbs 
     we investigate only questions involving verbs which denote a location change of the actor in the sentence. for a positive answer the trajectory of the actor  as recorded by the scene analysis system  must satisfy certain requirements or predicates which depend on the verb itself and the deep-case structure associated with i t . for locomotion verbs we use the following case slots: agent  location  source  goal  path  objective.

　　consider again question  1 . here the two primitive predicates 'moving' and 
'stationary* have to be applied to the actor trajectory over the interval of consideration. they can be easily computed from the object positions for each instance of the sequence. four basic situations can be distinguished: intervals where the object is stationary  
moving  beginning to move  and beginning to be stationary. the f i r s t case is not interesting since we are analyzing locomotion verbs. the other three possibilities represent verb inherent features  namely the manners of action: durative  inchoative and resultant. some examples of verbs which can be analyzed using the above predicates are 'fahren' 
 'drive'   'gehen'  'walk'   'anfahren'   ' s t a r t '     'losgehen'  'start walking'   'stoppen'  'stop' . 
　　verbs like 'abbiegen'  'turn o f f   or 'wenden'  'turn'  imply trajectories with more detailed properties. predicates involving the change of direction of a trajectory w i l l be required  none of which have as yet been accurately designed. 
     finally  we consider the situation where slots are f i l l e d besides the agent slot. this may be due to prepositional clauses or transitive verbs. 
 1  bog das auto von der haltstrasse in die fahrstrasse ab   did the car turn off haltstrasse into fahrstrasse   
	in this example the slots 	source 	and 
goal 	are 	f i l l e d by 'von haltstrasse' and 
'in fahrstrasse'  respectively. the system not only checks whether there is a trajectory with the specified shape within the interval of consideration but also requires this trajectory to satisfy the spatial constraints imposed by the contents of the slots. 
	iv 	conclusion 
　　a natural language dialogue system and a scene analysis system for image sequences are being connected to explore the possibility of natural language communication with image understanding systems in general  and verbal description of motion in particular. a symbolic scene description in terms of time dependent object locations  and some additional properties  has been proposed as a level of representation suitable to serve as a referential database for inquiries. 
answering yes/no questions about motion is viewed as a top-down process aiming at verifying certain trajectory properties. three types of constraints on a trajectory can be distinguished. first  the interval of consideration as a temporal constraint  second  trajectory shape in space and time  third  spatial constraints on the location of a trajectory. it has been shown for some examples  how these constraints can be extracted from a question. the reported work is currently being implemented.
