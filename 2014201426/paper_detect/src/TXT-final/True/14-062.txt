mecs-ai is currently implemented on two 
data. 	the basic idea of t h i s system is to describe d i f f e r e n t lisp systems. 	one is interlisp  and 
the time flow as a chain of discrete events. another is epics-lisp. as a general purpose t o o l   the system consists of an inference-engine and a knowledge-base e d i t o r

so that consultation systems in any f i e l d can be so that they w i l l be transfered to the other

systems  as a part of general purpose tools for 
knowledge engineering systems. for t h i s purpose  the authors implemented a knowledge-base e d i t o r to

systems is the management c a p a b i l i t y for medical context  input data and conclusions given

　　　in f i g . l   the newest time-chunk is event-iii. therefor  inference rules o r i g i n a l l y applied for event-iii. in mecs-ai  inference rules can access to the data of past time-chunk. data of event-ii or of event-i may be r e f e r r e d to by rules which are applied for event-iii. if some data of event-ii or of event-i do not have been known when it is referred t o   the target-timechunk may be shifted temporary to event-ii or event-i in order to i n f e r the value f i r s t .

       it is also noted that each a t t r i b u t e may be defined to have special datatype for i t s values  in mecs-ai. datatype  unique  w i l l be used for a t t r i b u t e s which take only one v a l i d value at one-time. s i m i l a r l y    multiple  is used for a t t r i b u t e s which may take several values at one-time  and  numerical  is used for a t t r i b u t e s which take numerical values. this kind of datatype d e f i n i t i o n is quite useful for data access  rule syntax check  and data inquery processes. 
	iv 	control structures 
       in mecs-ai  as usual w i t h the general knowledge engineering t o o l s   the knowledge-base is separated from the inference-engine. our system provides an inference-engine  but does not provide any knowledge-base by i t s e l f . instead  it provides a knowledge-base e d i t o r to define and to modify knowledge-bases in any a p p l i c a t i o n f i e l d . 
       it is our special feature that the body of knowledge-base i t s e l f may be implemented as a 
1 

c o l l e c t i o n of several number of knowledge-units  instead of one single knowledge-unit. every knowledge-unit has an   a p p l y - c o n d i t i o n     and rules in a knowledge-unit are applied only when i t s apply-condition is s a t i s f i e d . fig.1 shows the whole structure of mecs-ai. 

　　　the user of mecs-ai can select  inferencetype  for each knowledge-unit. when   a p p l y - a l l   is selected  rules in the knowledge-unit w i l l be applied e x o r s t i v e l y   while when a l i s t of   context a t - r i b u t e value   i s selected  rules i n the knowledge-unit w i l l be applied according to the backward chaining scheme to f i n d out the  context a t t r i b u t e value  at the time of target-timechunk. 
　　　adopting t h i s control s t r u c t u r e   rules belong to c e r t a i n knowledge-unit w i l l never be applied if the apply-condition is not s a t i s f i e d . and therefor 
more e f f e c t i v e inference process can be r e a l i z e d . 
　　　this c o n t r o l structure is e f f e c t i v e and adaptive for any inference systems. 
	v 	concluding remarks and future planning 
　　　we have descrived our approach to the time-oriented features for the medical consultation the followings are known through the a p p l i c a t i o n of our method to a consultation system for t h y r o i d diseases: 
 1  the system can change the conclusion according to the treatments and p a t i e n t ' s status in the past. 
 1  the system can analyze the s i t u a t i o n which cannot be handled only through the one-time c o n s u l t a t i o n . 
 1  the system can adopt the powerful strategy such as  wait-and-see . 
　　　application of mecs-ai for other disease categories is now under consideration.
