 
a new algorithm for computing the maximum entropy ranking over models is presented. the algorithm handles arbitrary sets of propositional defaults with associated strength assignments and succeeds whenever the set satisfies a robustness condition. failure of this condition implies the problem may not be sufficiently specified for a unique solution to exist. this work extends the applicability of the maximum entropy approach detailed in  goldszmidt et a/.  1   and clarifies the assumptions on which the method is based. 
1 	introduction 
there have been several suggestions of what might constitute the best consequence relation to be associated with a set of propositional defaults. the weakest  and most widely accepted  is system p  adams  1    kraus et cd.  1 . of those which handle the more complex 
default interactions  such as exceptional inheritance  correctly  the maximum entropy approach  me  has  arguably  the clearest objective justification being derived from a well understood principle of indifference. in this paper  the me-approach of  goldszmidt et a/  1  is extended so that the me-ranking for an arbitrary set of variable strength defaults can be found. a new algorithm is presented along with a sufficient condition for its successful computation. as well as handling the usual examples from the literature in a satisfactory way  this extended framework provides a flexible method for handling default knowledge through its use of variable strength defaults which sheds some light on previously ambiguous examples. indeed  the results suggest that some examples are inherently ambiguous. however  the clear underlying principle of the me-approach clarifies why this ambiguity arises  and suggests how it might be resolved. 
1 	deriving the me-ranking 
 consider a set of defaults   where  are formulae of a finite propositional language  
1 	automated reasoning 
     with the usual connectives  the symbol  denotes a default connective. the models of are contained in the set a model  is said to verify a default  conversely  a model  
m  is said to falsify a default  
　the semantics of defaults is given in terms of conditional probabilities. each default is supposed to constrain a set of probability distributions. for example  if it were assumed that 1  then the set  would define all those probability distributions which satisfied the constraint imposed by the default. however  in this context no actual conditional probabilities are specified only the  fixed  relationships between the defaults in a given set. 
　the entropy of a probability distribution over a set of models 
the problem is to select that probability distribution which maximises  1  subject to constraints imposed by the defaults. the main supposition underlying this formalism is that specifying relative orders of magnitude for the conditional probabilities corresponding to each default implies a similar order of magnitude description of the probabilities of each model. this is achieved by parameterising the conditional probabilities and examining the behaviour as the parameter tends to zero. intuitively  this can be thought of as taking a set of assumptions to the extreme in order to ascertain what other information is implied. the intuitive interpretation of the relative orders of magnitude between defaults is that one is required to specify their relative strengths; that is  numerically higher strength defaults can be thought of as holding more strongly than  or as having priority over  those of lower strength. note that the symbol ~ will be used to denote asymptotic equality since  for the purposes of this analysis  it is only the asymptotic behaviour of the probabilities that is important not their actual values  nor indeed the actual value of entropy. 
　goldszmidt et al.  originally chose to use inequalities for the default constraints but were unable to obtain results except for a small class of default sets  termed minimal core sets  which were guaranteed to sat-

isfy the constraints as equalities. as they pointed out  for minimal core sets  their algorithm is easily adapted to cater for variable strength defaults. for arbitrary sets  however  the algorithm is unsound and an analysis of the behaviour of the me-approach applied to variable strength defaults was not provided. 
　in this revised analysis  the maximum entropy approach is extended by insisting on working with strict equality constraints  at least up to asymptotic equivalence. specifying relative strengths for all defaults limits the region of possible probability distributions from which the maximum entropy distribution is taken. although this requires a firmer commitment  that is  more information  from the knowledge engineer  it leads to rae-eolutions in a much larger number of cases. 
　　each default is assigned an associated strength  or order of magnitude  relative to the other defaults. asymptotically  the coefficients of conditional probabilities can be ignored and so only the relative orders of magnitude between models will be relevant. the strength of each default is therefore expressed as some power of a parameter e which has no significance other than linking all defaults together. thus a default will be said to have relative strength a iff for some integer letting the t e r m a n d so 
p and the default becomes arbitrarily certain. in specifying a default  it is assumed that the knowledge engineer is encoding information which he takes to be almost certain. similarly  the probability of each model m will be assumed to be asymptotically equivalent to some non-negative integer power  so that 
       the constraints imposed can be written as: 
using these constraints and the lagrange multiplier technique to find the point of maximum entropy  goldszmidt et al.  derived the following elegant and simple approximation for the probability of each model 
		 1  
where the α1 are related to the lagrange multipliers for each rule. making a further assumption that the αi can also be approximated by a relative order of magnitude  
thus writing the probability expressions  1  are substituted back into the constraints  1  yielding simultaneous equations with  unknowns  the 
　in the limit as  1 those models with the lowest powers of e will dominate  and the constraints reduce to: 

given this ranking  over defaults  the me-ranking over models  can be found using equation  1 . the me-rank of each model is given by the sum of the meranks of those defaults it falsifies: 
		 1  
this completes the derivation of the maximum entropy ranking with defining the me-consequence relation. the following section looks at conditions under which the assumptions used to find equations  1  and  1  are valid. 
1 	robustness of rankings 
in the above analysis  it was assumed that it was only necessary to consider the asymptotic behaviour of the defaults  and that fixing the relative strength of defaults in this way uniquely determined the me-ranking. it turns out that while this is not true in general  it is true for a useful class of problems which this section characterises. as an example of a case in which the assumptions are not true  consider the following where the probabilities  1  are used to consider what may happen when all defaults have the same strength but their coefficients are allowed to vary. 
example 1 

the table shows whether a model falsifies or verifies each default and gives its  unnormalised  probability using equation  1 : 

equal strength of 1  and letting their coefficients be c1  c1  c1  respectively  the constraint equations  1  give rise to three simultaneous equations: 

solving these for the αi in terms of u gives:

now consider what happens asymptotically for various values of the coefficients.

1 different choices for the coefficients clearly lead to completely different me-rankings over the defaults and  more importantly  over the models. this is because there are multiple solutions to the non-linear simultaneous equations given by  1 . in addition to having many solutions  these equations may have no solution at all if the strength assignments represent inconsistent probabilistic constraints. however  for maximum entropy entailment to be well-defined  it is desirable to be able to determine when a unique solution to these equations can be found. this is guaranteed whenever the me-ranking is robust. 
definition s.1 an integer ranking   over models is said to be robustl with respect to a set of defaults  with associated strengths  if no two defaults share  common minimal falsifying model in 
in the sequel    respectively   represent minimal verifying  respectively  falsifying  models of in similarly    respectively  represent minimal verifying  respectively  falsifying  models of and so on. 
definition 1 an integer ranf ing  over α set of defaults   with associated strengths   is said to be me-valid with respect to that set if it satisfies  1  and for all 
		 1  
definition 1 two me-valid rankings   and are said to be distinct iff for some default 
such a default is said to be distinctly ranked. 
the following lemma shows that any distinctly ranked default   which has minimal among distinctly ranked defaults  also has minimal among distinctly ranked defaults. 
　　1  adopting the use of  robustness  to indicate existence of a unique solution from  bacchus et al.  1 . 
1 	automated reasoning 
lemma 1 given two distinct me-vatid rankings  and   if r is such that and for all with then 
proof. suppose otherwise  that is  there exists rf # r  
such that 	with 	but 
             without loss of generality  suppose that 	has minimal 	among distinctly ranked defaults. now  because 	is me-valid  and 	can only falsify defaults  s  for which 	' s   so that 
which contradiction implies 
	as required. 	
theorem 1 given a finite set of defaults   with associated strengths    if a robust me-valid ranking  k  exists then it is unique. 
proof. let and  be distinct me-valid rankings and be a distinctly ranked default with minimal  among 
distinctly ranked defaults and  by lemma 1  minimal suppose that  is robust. then falsifies only and other defaults  s  with also since they only falsify non-distinctly ranked defaults  and  since both and are me-valid  
it follows that 	with 
　consider 	for which 	but and 	falsifies only non-distinctly ranked defaults and 	itself  for which 	therefore and hence 
now  if 	falsified no other distinctly ranked default  which contradicts  being 
minimal in this implies that  must falsify some other distinctly ranked defaults and hence  is not robust. let these be  since all theseare also minimal distinctly ranked defaults in  by lemma 
1  they are also minimal in  and there must exist 
  minimally ranked falsifying models in 
such that 	k 	for all  further  because 
is robust  none of the can falsify any other distinctly ranked defaults. 
　　but  by the same argument as above  this implies that for all however  this in turn implies that which falsifies all the  and non-distinctly ranked defaults  must have a lower rank than in 
i.e.   which contradicts 	being 
the minimal falsifying model of in k. hence  cannot be robust either. it follows that  if two distinct merankings exist  neither can be robust  and any robust me-valid ranking is unique. 

 note that given two distinct rankings  and it may still be the case that for all i.e.  the ranking over models may be unique despite there being multiple solutions for the  to the constraint equations  1  and  1 . for example  the set produces the two equations 
which have no solution unless in which case there are an infinite number of solutions. however  all solutions lead to the same unique ranking over models. refining the robustness condition and understanding its significance in such cases is the subject of ongoing research. 
1 	computing the me-ranking 
using the robustness condition and equation  1   it is possible to determine the me-ranking over defaults one by one. robustness guarantees that for at least one default the currently computed minimal ranks of models are indeed their genuine ranks in the me-ranking. 
　let the function minv  respectively  minf  be defined so that it returns the rank of the current minimal verifying model of   respectively  the rank of the current minimal falsifying model of  excluding its own 
contribution  using equation  1 . then equation  1  can be re-written as 
		 1  
which in the algorithm is used to assign the rank of a default using 
	 1  algorithm to compute me-ranking 
input: a set of defaults.   and associated strength assignments  
output: the me-ranking  k  or an exception if the set is p-inconsistent  or if the robustness condition is violated. 

 assign ranks to models using equation  1 . 
 validate the ranking by ensuring both that the constraints  1  and that the robustness condition are satisfied. output either the me-ranking or an exception. 
　　this algorithm clearly terminates at step 1  if the input set is probabilistically inconsistent  or at step 1  or at step 1. termination does not guarantee that a valid ranking has been found but this is checked for and reported at step 1. the following theorem proves that  provided the robustness condition is satisfied  the algorithm will compute the unique me-ranking. that the algorithm works given certain pre-conditions can be verified if the two ranks in the assignment  1  can be shown to be valid. this requires that the ranks selected for minv and minf r  when the assignment is made are indeed the minimal ranks for 
theorem 1 given a finite set of defaults   with associated strengths  the algorithm computes the unique me-ranking  'is robust. 
proof. the theorem is proved by induction. on the first pass of the loop no rules have been ranked and so the ranks of each rule ranked  i.e. none  are correct. the inductive hypothesis assumes that at the nth pass of the loop all rules ranked in the previous passes have been assigned their correct me-ranks. consider that on the nth pass of the loop  rule  with minimal minv is selected to be ranked. 
　let be a verifying model of  such that minv . suppose that is not a minimal verifying model of so there exists such that 
now  the computed minimal verifying rank for so it must be the case that  falsifies some rule  ' which has not yet been ranked  and since was not selected to be ranted in this pass of the loop it follows that 
then  since 	in particular  using  1  

continuing in this way  an infinite descending chain of distinct unranked rules is constructed. this contradicts the finite size of the original default set  and therefore must be a minimal verifying model of be a falsifying model of such that 
           minf . suppose that is not a minimal falsifying model of so there exists /r  such that 
. now  since 	the computed minimal falsifying rank for it must be the case that  falsifies some rule  which has not yet been ranked  and since  was not selected to be ranked in this pass of the loop it follows that 
now  and under the assumption that the robustness condition holds  no two defaults share a com-

so 	that 	the computed minimal verifying rank for r'. it follows that 	too  must falsify some rule  	which has not yet been ranked. then  since 	falsifies 	ccmtmuing in this way  an infinite descending chain of distinct unranked rules is constructed. this contradicts the finite size of the original default set and therefore  must be a minimal falsifying model of 
　　given that for the selected rule  the values minv and minp  calculated at this pass of the loop represent the me-ranks of its minimal verifying and falsifying models  excluding its own contribution   respectively  it follows that the assignment 
		 1  
is valid and is assigned its correct me-rank. the theorem follows by induction.

　to determine default consequences it is necessary to compare the ranks of a default's minimum verifying and falsifying models. since the solution holds for any strength assignment  it follows that some default conclusions may hold in general. in particular  
it can be seen that the default since 
is a pref-
 1  
again this result holds regardless of the strength assignments and illustrates that  for this example  the inheritance of to p via b is uncontroversial. example 1  nixon diamond  

the intended interpretation is that quakers are pacificists whereas republicans are not pacifists. given a strength assignment of  s1 s1  is easily shown that 
. the classical problem associ-
ated with this knowledge base is to ask whether nixon  being a quaker and a republican  is pacifist or not. this is represented by the default the two relevant models to compare are and whose me-ranks in the general me-solution are 
 1  
me-entailed depending on the comparative strengths s1 and s1. this result is in accordance with the  intuitive  solution that no conclusion should be drawn regarding nixon's pacifist status unless there is reason to suppose that one default holds more strongly than the other. in the case of one default being stronger  the conclusion favoured by the stronger would prevail. 
example 1  royal elephants/marine chaplains  

there are two interpretations of this knowledge base. in the first  the propositions a  1  c  and d  stand for royal  elephant  african and grey  respectively; in the second  the propositions stand for chaplain  man  marine and beer drinker  respectively. the constraint equations  1  give rise to: 



the key question relating to this knowledge base is 
 are elephants which are both royal and african  not grey *  or alternatively   don't marine chaplains drink beer   this translates into the default which is me-entailed in general as can be seen from: 

　the result in this example is unambiguous  that is  it holds for all strength assignments1. however   touretzky et al.  1  were not entirely happy about the conclusion that marine-chaplains do not drink beer. they argued that if the rate of beer drinking amongst marines was significantly higher than normal  then this might alter the behaviour associated with marine-chaplains. 
　　now  the default  marines drink beer  is in fact me-entailed by but adding it to the database with all defaults having equal strength violates the robustness condition. if  however   were added with a higher strength  so that it represented a new constraint for the purposes of maximising entropy  a robust solution would result and the status of the default would depend on the relative strengths 1 ana s1. 
　so  touretzky et al. were correct to suppose that if marines were heavier drinkers than men in general then it may not be clear whether marine chaplains are beer drinkers or not. however  it seems they were expecting too much of a default reasoning mechanism  a pathbased inheritance reasoner in their case  in assuming it could draw such conclusions since this would involve using information which it had never been told. 
it is interesting to note that many of the more complex examples from the literature  for example  see  makinson and schlechta  1    which have been devised deliberately to overcome any intuitive biases  fail to satisfy the robustness condition when all defaults are assigned equal strengths. if a set is probabilistically consistent it is usually possible to restore robustness by altering the strengths. this suggests that some sets may be too complex for the human intuition to disentangle because they are ambiguous or under specified. by requiring more information from the knowledge engineer  in terms of a strength assignment over defaults  some of these ambiguities can be cleared up and the hitherto implicit biases made explicit. 
1 	conclusions 
this paper has refined and extended the work of goldszmidt et oi.  on applying the principle of maximum entropy to probabilistic semantics for default rules to enable it to be applied to a much wider class of default sets. a new algorithm was presented which finds the 
   1in fact all these examples have general solutions since they are minimal core sets as defined by goidszmidt et ai {1 . 
maximum entropy ranking for a set of variable strength defaults that satisfy a sufficient condition for a unique solution to exist. the output is a consequence relation based on a total ordering of models-a rational consequence relation in the sense of lehmann and magidor  lehmann and magidor  1 . some extreme technical cases remain to be investigated. 
　using the me-approach for default reasoning provides the same benefits as its use in statistical problems. as jaynes  suggests  by encoding all known relevant information and finding the maximum entropy distribution  any observation.s which differ significantly from the result imply that other constraints  in this case defaults  exist. a closer approximation is obtained by adding more defaults or by adjusting the strengths. instead of questioning the conclusions of a default reasoning system  one should ensure that all relevant information has been encoded - the maximum entropy formalism enables the precise and explicit representation of this as default knowledge. the main disadvantage of the meapproach is its intractability  however  this extension to arbitrary sets has shed some light onto the causes of controversy among classical examples from the literature and pointed to ways of resolving them.
