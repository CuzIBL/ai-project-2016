	1 . 	introduction 
concept learning on sets of s t r u c t u r a l descriptions has become one of the most challenging problems in al-research in the last decade / 1 /   / 1 /   / 1 /   / 1 /   / 1 /   / 1 /   / 1 / . 
there is increasing success of programs that make use of domain-specific knowl-
edge l i k e dendral and metadendral. but there remain areas  where a p r i o r i knowl-
edge may be not or only p a r t i a l l y a v a i l -
able or the a q u i s i t i o n and application of knowledge would be d i f f i c u l t as in con-
s t r u c t i n g rules from large sets of empiri c a l data. 
on the other hand in order to leave the empirical stage and to establish theoret i c a l foundations ai has to discover gen-
eral principles and to find appropriate formalizations for them. therefore u n i fied mathematical models should be ap-
plied as far as possible-
there are p r a c t i c a l applications of concept or discrimination learning in which 
f i r s t 	the structures and t r a i n i n g samples 
are large  second the concepts may be disjunctive sets of subconcepts and t h i r d matching is complicated because of the existence of many isomorphic descriptions  alphabetic v a r i a n t s   . 
it is f e l t that in such cases well elaborated general algorithms such as the i n -
ductive generalization in the predicate calculus and even the version space method / 1 / would face problems of combinat o r i a l explosion   refinements of the predicate calculus-based methods are de-
veloped in our laboratory / 1 / which  	it is hoped  w i l l overcome some of the d i f f i c u l t i e s in dealing 	with p r a c t i c a l problems.

	1. concept 	learning 
as an algorithm for concept learning a method of sequentially constructing hypo*theses in form of decision trees is used  
which is more appropriate to problems with large feature vectors# it is a gene r a l i z a t i o n of human behaviour observed in learning concepts represented by propositional functions / 1 / and it is similar to the algorithm of learning d i s c r i -
mination nets for syllables described in / 1 / . it corresponds to a general-to-spec i f i c d e p t h - f i r s t search with reexamination of past events.  due to limited stm capacity human beings are keeping only one hypothesis per step in memory. this method is preferred to a possible b r e a t h - f i r s t search since in case of large structures  large t r a i n i n g samples  
and disjunctive concepts the number of hypotheses to be pursued simultaneously would be probably to large even in the case of the l a t t i c e - t h e o r e t i c approach used in / 1 / . in large samples it is also not easy to get i n i t i a l clusters for d i s junctive concepts.  since the decision trees are b u i l t up s e r i a l l y by adding no more than one new test a t t r i b u t e  test node  per step to the tree  the set of a t t r i b u t e s a = {v   . . .   v } c o n s t i t u t i n g 
the feature vectors is a p r i o r i reordered 
by some elementary discrimination measure known in pattern recognition.  in a more sophisticated approach this procedure is applied to each branch of the tree representing the current hypothesis.  the algorithm can be defined in terms of simple data driven production r u l e s . in the case of f i n i t e consistent t r a i n i n g 
samples it can be proved / 1 / that it results in a f i n a l hypothesis which matches a l l t r a i n i n g instances c o r r e c t l y . i n / 1 / extensions to the case of inconsistent training samples  p r o b a b i l i s t i c decisions  
and continuously varying a t t r i b u t e s   a l gorithmic construction of feature i n t e r vals during learning  can also be found.

since the use of a l l possible features  graph properties  characterizing a structure would lead to combinatorial explosion  subsets of feature are extracted by a unified p r i n c i p l e . global characteri s t i c s  subgraphs  relevant to the concept 
are subsequently synthesized in the form of boolean functions constituting the f i nal concept d e s c r i p t i o n . complex or elementary features irrelevant to the concept and yet included in the f i n a l hypothesis can be eliminated by a second-
