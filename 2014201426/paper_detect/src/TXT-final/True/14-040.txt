	1. 	introduction 
　　　several mobile robots have been developed for ai research. their mobile mechanisms have two essential functions: 
 1  to ensure smooth movement  and 
 1  to know the current position and direction in the world. 
steering methods perform the f i r s t function by one of the following schemes: 
 1  steering and moving by driving wheels and steering wheels. 
 1  steering and moving by driving wheels that have a steering function   l   . 
 1  steering and moving by two independent driving wheels  idws  that make the robot move in any a r b i t r a r i l y selected d i r e c t i o n   1     1       1 . 
　　this research was supported by grants in aid for s c i e n t i f i c research from the ministry of education of the japanese government. 
　　　it is easy to achieve movement using only these two basic operations  but t h i s does not guarantee smooth motion. for instance  when the robot is moving  a s l i g h t modification to i t s track d i r e c t i o n requires stopping the forward motion. smooth motions are useful to minimize the time required to complete the movement. 
　　　theoretically  an idw leg system can draw a c i r c u l a r track with any a r b i t r a r y radius 1 ~ ＜＜  given control of the r a t i o of the two wheel speeds. furthermore  the radius of the track can be changed smoothly by increasing or decreasing the wheel speeds with constant acceleration. in order to control these c a p a b i l i t i e s   the command system described in t h i s paper has been designed and has been i n s t a l l e d on a mobile robot  yamabico 1   1   . 
　　　yamabico 1 has two microcomputer systems for the brain and the legs  and has a communication channel between the two. when the robot is to go to a d e s t i n a t i o n   path finding and command sequence planning are executed by the b r a i n   while the leg subsystem performs low level motor control functions. a similar functional d i s t r i b u t i o n is 
used on the robot reported in reference   1   . 
1. th♀ leg status 
       important information about the motion of the robot includes i t s p o s i t i o n   d i r e c t i o n   v e l o c i t y and t r a v e l l i n g distance  and t h i s is called leg status. the brain issues commands to the leg subsystem to reference and update the leg status and to control movement  using the interface channel between these two subsystems. the leg subsystem confirms to the brain that each command has been executed. variables of the leg status are l i s t e d in table 1. 
　　　this information can be divided into s t a t i c and dynamic information. static information includes: 
  l   the position of the robot 
　　　a point c in the robot is defined as the center of the robot. a d i r e c t i o n d is defined on

 1  terminating conditions 
     while the command is being executed  the leg subsystem examines the terminating condition. if the condition is satisfied then the command is terminated. if the condition has the format v = k  where v is a variable in the leg status specified by the  variable 1   then the value of v  value v   is compared with k. the condition is satisfied if value v  is greater than or equal to k when value v  is increasing  or if value v  is less than or equal to k when the value v  is decreasing. 
     the condition 'speed = vl' is satisfied if the speed of the robot's center is equal to the specified value in the case of gostraight and turn commands  or if the speed of the right wheel is equal to the specified value in the case of the spin command. 
     the condition str is satisfied if the robot goes straight  which occurs when the two driving wheels have equal speed. the condition cms is satisfied if both driving wheels have zero acceleration. 
　　　some terminating conditions may remain unsatisfied indefinitly. the terminating condition can be omitted. if the command has no condition then it is not terminated. 
　　　the acceptance and the execution of control commands do not modify the state of the fifo storage and the execution state of the motion command  except for terminate and cancel commands. the operations of the control commands are as follows: 
 1  get command 
　　　the value of the v a r i a b l e   specified by  variable 1   of the leg status is returned as a reply. the returned value is the value the leg status has at that moment. 
　　　for example  'get  ss ' returns the value of the odometer. 
 1  update command 
　　　the command writes the value of the variable of the leg status specified by  variable 1 . 
for example  'update  xx  1   ' sets xx to 1. 
 1  set and reset commands 
　　　the leg subsystem always monitors the t r a v e l l i n g distance  the d i r e c t i o n of the robot  and the other variables in the leg status. it has a mechanism which can generate signals for the brain at a given distance or d i r e c t i o n i n t e r v a l . for example  signals can be generated each time the robot moves 1 cm. this feature is u s e f u l   for example  when the robot measures distances to the l e f t side wall at equal i n t e r v a l s . the i n t e r v a l s in distance and d i r e c t i o n are recorded in ssi and dd1  respectively. ddi and ssi are not included in the leg status because they need not be read by the b r a i n . 
　　　when a set command is accepted  the leg subsystem begins to generate signals each time the robot moves the specified distance or d i r e c t i o n . 
　　　the reset command terminates t h i s generation of signals.
