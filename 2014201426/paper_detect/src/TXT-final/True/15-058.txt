 
this paper considers how to represent rule knowledge in a chess-endgame procedure. the procedure  to he 
used j o i n t l y w i t h d e p t h - f i r s t searching  deals w i t h the king  bishop and knight versus king  kbnk  endgame; the rules derive from theory books  discussions w i t h  grand masters and the author's e x p e r i ence . 
the knowledge about rules is s t r u c t u r e d : p a r t i t i o n ing i n t o patterned equivalence classes  bramer  1  1  is extended so as to make the procedure act s i m i l a r l y to a human expert  who  in the kbnk domain  p r e f e r s to be guided by patterns rather than by e x p l o r i n g move sequences in depth. the procedure  applied by i n c o r p o r a t i o n in pion  a chess-playing program  has been tested and commented upon by averbach and others and has proved to execute c o r r e c t mates in a l l cases submitted. it is concluded t h a t   w i t h i n i t s domain  i t s l e v e l i s that of a chess expert though no proof is a v a i l a b l e t h a t i t s play i s o p t i m a l . 
kbnk has been solved c o n s t r u c t i v e l y by a supplementary data-base approach  e s t a b l i s h i n g it as a 1move game in the maximin sense. this r e s u l t   as w e l l as some others presented here  are new to the theory of chess. the research reported may w e l l lead to improving experts' p l a y . 
1 . 	introduction 
while the theory of chess 	is c o n t i n u a l l y being added t o   	it i s   by the same token  	far from p e r f e c t . in the l a s t few years  	a new element has entered: extension of the theory no longer depends on human thoughts and ideas only. 	in the chess 	f i e l d   	a i programs and problem-solving programs  	c o n s u l t i n g a pre-constructed data base  have begun to c o n t r i bute. the s t r a t e g y is known to depend on the concepts the player has in mind. for example  a grandmaster  knows  how to handle a c e r t a i n p o s i t i o n and t h i s is why he immediately  sees  the   r i g h t   move  de groot  	1 . extending the body of knowledge capable of supporting the chess-player's concepts may r e s u l t in an e x p e r t ' s p l a y i n g : 
  i  acceptably in p o s i t i o n s where no guidance was a v a i l a b l e before; 
  i i   correctly in p o s i t i o n s which were not s u f f i c i e n t l y explored before; 
  i i i   optimally in p o s i t i o n s exhaustively charted by the knowledge s u p p l i e d . 
the fundamental question reads as f o l l o w s : is it possible to achieve s i m i l a r r e s u l t s by extending the knowledge of a chess program as by extending the knowledge a v a i l a b l e to human experts  for some types of endgame  the answer is in the a f f i r m a t i v e   though the process of extending a program's knowledge is far from t r i v i a l  bramer  1; bratko & n i b l e t t   1; van den herik  1 b   . 
the knowledge to be supplied is extensive and h i g h ly d e t a i l e d   e . g .   the rules in the kbnk endgame need to be very e x p l i c i t even if the king alone is pinioned since he may be in the wrong corner  . this paper w i l l r e p o r t the r e s u l t s of a new method  van den herik  1 b  1  of representing knowledge  combined w i t h conventional d e p t h - f i r s t searching  to the special domain of the kbnk endgame. 
1. 	the structure of the algorithm 
bramer  1   i n t r o d u c i n g the concept of equivalence classes  did not admit any searching beyond a depth of one p l y . in h i s view  in an elementary endgame  such as king and pawn vs. king  kpk   the p r o gram should r e l y on e x p l i c i t knowledge o n l y . even for kpk  bramer's program needs 1 classes for a 
correct  strategy and 1 for an optimal s t r a t e g y . as the complexity of the endgame increases  a point is soon reached where the number of equivalence classes grows beyond reason  van den herik  1 a   . in order to keep the number of classes  embodying knowledge  down to manageable proportions for more complex endgames  the concomitant use of deeper searching is a p p r o p r i a t e . this combination has proved succesful in a number of four-piece endgames  such as knpk  kbnk and kbpk. 
our basic move-finding a l g o r i t h m  in which white is assumed to be the stronger side and to move f i r s t     derived from bramer's a l g o r i t h m   is s t r u c t u r e d as f o l l o w s : 
a  generate the set q of a l l 	immediate successor po-
s i t i o n s of a p o s i t i o n p; 
b  f i n d the highest ranked element of q  	say q; 
c  play the move corresponding to q. 
in step b     find means 'determine by g o a l - d i r e c t e d s e a r c h ' . in accordance w i t h bramer  we induce a ranking on q  by d e f i n i n g an o v e r a l l ranking on the set q*  being the set of a l l legal btm  black to move  p o s i t i o n s . we assign each p o s i t i o n in q to exactly one of a number of d i s j o i n t subsets  exh a u s t i v e l y p a r t i t i o n i n g q . the aim is for each subset of the partition  termed a class  to correspond to some s i g n i f i c a n t recognizable feature of the endgame as perceived by chess-players  e . g .   'black is in check*. the connection between ' p a r t i t i o n '   ' f e a t u r e ' and ' c l a s s ' is given by regarding features as equivalence r e l a t i o n s   on which a fundamental 

if a p o s i t i o n belongs to the r e s i d u a l c l a s s   the search must be continued; no assignment should be made at t h i s p o i n t   an analogous procedure s t a r t s w i t h black to move and black's set of f.. if two d i f f e r e n t moves lead to p o s i t i o n s which belong to the same class  other than the r e s i d u a l c l a s s     a s p e c i f i c scoring f u n c t i o n must be applied in order t o break t i e s . i f the t i e p e r s i s t s   the f i r s t p o s i t ion examined w i l l be chosen. of course  a maximum depth of searching has to be decided in advance. having reached the maximum depth values must be assigned to each p o s i t i o n so reached. this means that 
we need two more sets of equivalence classes f o r final p o s i t i o n s w i t h white and black to move respec-
t i v e l y . 
the four sets of equivalence classes required to construct an evaluated search tree may be w h i t t l e d down to three when one determines t h a t a s p e c i f i c side is always to move in the maximum depth p o s i t i o n . we introduce the f o l l o w i n g names for our s e t s . 
stop 	the set of patterns 	 features of p o s i t -
	ions  	w i t h black to move a p p l i c a b l e when 
the value of the p o s i t i o n i n v e s t i g a t e d 
can be determined s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d l y ; 
halt 	s i m i l a r 	to stop  	but w i t h white 	to move; 
blackeval: 	the set of p a t t e r n s which d i f f e r e n t i a t e 
among the p o s i t i o n s w i t h black to move-
when the maximum depth of searching has 
been reached and the p o s i t i o n s must be 
evaluated; 
whiteval 	s i m i l a r 	to 	blackeval  	but 	w i t h 	white 	to 
move.

in order to prevent the generation of inappropriate moves  a h e u r i s t i c f u n c t i o n   c a l l e d reject  has been introduced which trims the generator of a l l l e g a l moves i n t o a generator of a l l p l a u s i b l e moves f o r the endgame in q u e s t i o n . in summary  the algorithm constructs a tree w i t h a v a r i a b l e but l i m i t e d depth. the fanout varies w i t h the l e v e l   p l y   . this and the actual depth depend on the given p o s i t i o n . 
1. 	the kbnk program 
in a previous experiment  we used the knpk ending w i t h the pawn on the h - f i l e as a t e s t - b e d for the representation of chess-endgame knowledge  van den herik  1 b  1 . one of the possible g e n e r a l i zations mentioned in the 1 a r t i c l e was the a p p l i c a t i o n of t h a t technique to the kbnk endgame. the r e s u l t i n g kbnk program  hedeam  has been designed and implemented by van den herik  dekker and ampt. it is based on the theory for t h i s s p e c i f i c endgame as pioneered by deletang  1  and very systematic a l l y described by che ron  1  . dekker and ampt 
  1  have recast t h i s theory f o r s p e c i f i c use in an endgame program. 

none of these assumptions d e t r a c t s from g e n e r a l i t y :  i  is circumvented by r e l a b e l l i n g sides;   i i   can be complied w i t h by r e f l e c t i o n in the v e r t i c a l midl i n e   w h i l e   i i i   can always be made to o b t a i n by 
mirror r e f l e c t i o n in one of the diagonals or b o t h . 
in stop  halt  blackeval  whiteval and reject  chess knowledge from theory books  grandmasters and the a u t h o r ' s experience is accumulated. the numbers of p a t t e r n s in the e v a l u a t i o n f u n c t i o n s t o t a l : 1 in stop  1 in halt  1 in blackeval and 1 in whiteval. 
a f u l l d e s c r i p t i o n of the p a t t e r n s in these f u n c t ions is given by van den herik  1 . 

the i n t r o d u c t i o n of these four sets of evaluation f u n c t i o n s leads n a t u r a l l y to a tree s t r u c t u r e of 
which the f o l l o w i n g is a t y p i c a l instance.  our example is a 1-ply t r e e ; 	the numbering of the branches r e f l e c t s the sequence of t r a v e r s a l in t h i s 
i n s t a n c e .   
in order to convey some idea about the p a r t i t i o n s by c l a s s   we c i t e the f i r s t p a r t of stop  w i t h the p a t terns transposed i n t o human terms. 
class 1: bishop or knight are no longer on the board class 1: mate 
to mate the black king alone  starting from an ar-
bitrary position with white to move and assuming optimal counterplay by black  
the estimates of chess publicists diverge considerably: pachman conjectured 1  rabinovich 1  euwe/ donner 1  fine 1  golombek 'about 1'  averbach 'etwa 1'  znosko-borovsky 1. no specification is found in b i j l   cheron  keres and withuis. computer chess researcher bramer  1  stated: ' . . . the endgame king  bishop and knight versus king is thought to require up to 1 moves to win and an error in certain c r i t i c a l positions can easily lead to an exceeding of the 1-move l i m i t . ' 
prompted by the prevailing uncertainty  dekker and 
van den herik decided to build a data base for the kbnk endgame solving the maximin problem  in fact by exhaustive enumeration. their findings have been published in 'computerschaak'  dekker & van den herik  1 b  1 c  stressing the chess-theoretical aspects and in the hcc nieuwsbrief   dekker & van den herik  1 a  1 b  with stress on the computerscience aspects. 
the most important results are 
1. the kbnk endgame has a 1-move maximin solution. 
1. rabinovich was the only one to have this predicted. 
1. no chess publicist  not even rabinovich  had published an analysis optimal in the maximin sense. 
1. there are 1 'mate in 1' positions. 
1. not a single 'mate in 1' position had been published before  let alone a 'mate in 1' solution. 
1. black's best counterplay often involves his taking refuge in a corner the extreme square of 
which is opposite in colour to white's bishop's. 
1. forcing the king from the large bishop triangle to the middle bishop triangle  the method of deletang  need not represent an optimal method of 
play. 
1. the kbnk data base contributes to the theory of chess by providing new patterns. 
1. 	future research 
the implementation of the kbnk endgame  as embodied in hedeam  has also led to an improvement of endgame-program construction by sparking a new idea in the compilation of knowledge to be fed to programs. in order to be able to deal with a large amount of endgame programs  we are working on a pattern compiler pursuing the following aims: 
a  to make the pattern files readable to a chess-player who is not a computer specialist; 
b  to give chess-players of this kind the opportu-
nity to construct  in person  a pattern f i l e for a given endgame; 
c  to be able to implement a l l subsequent programs much faster. 
a fuller description of this idea has been published by van den herik  1 . 
another research item is based on a contrast between pattern-driven hedeam and the brute-force data-base approach. whenever hedeam deviates from the optimal path  it is intended that the program's rules should be refined with the ultimate aim of refining the program's strategy  now correct  into an optimal one in bramer's 1 sense of these terms.
