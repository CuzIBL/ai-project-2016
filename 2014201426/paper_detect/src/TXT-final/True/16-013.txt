	iv 	organization of the research 
     in accordance with the above  our research is divided into three tasks:  1  developing a formal language for semantic representations   1  developing formal languages for intermediate levels   1  writing the system's rules  which f u n c t i o n to carry out the mappings between the above representations  . 
a. 	semantic representation 
     we i l l u s t r a t e - our approach w i t h a few represent a t i v e examples. 	consider the f o l l o w i n g f i v e 	sentences  which are t y p i c a l for n a t u r a l stock 	market 
r e p o r t s : 
 1  bow valley jumped 1/1  to 1. 
 1  rio algom eased j to close at 1/1. 
 1  a b i t i b i was up s h a r p l y   gaining 1 to 1/1  
 1  ibm chalked up a 1-point g a i n   c l o s i n g at 1. 
 1  bank of montreal moved up s m a r t l y   adding 1/1 to 1. 
to describe the meanings of these s e n t e n c e s   a n d a l l s i m i l a r sentences  we propose an o r i e n t e d sema n t i c network in which nodes are l a b e l l e d w i t h the p r i m i t i v e semantic elements of our u n i v e r s e and arcs are l a b e l l e d w i t h numbers i n d i c a t i n g the a r g u ment s l o t s . semantic elements are of two basic t y pes   a  predicates   i n a broad sense  which in our sublanguage have from one to f o u r a r g u m e n t s ;  b   names of  e n t i t i e s such as s t o c k s   companies  sums of money  e t c . : these may include v a r i a b l e s for e n t i t i e s . our network r e p r e s e n t a t i o n is b a s i c a l l y equivalent t o a formula o f p r e d i c a t e l o g i c   but has the advantage of p e r s p i c u i t y p r i m a r i l y because our network is free of l i n e a r order. since sentences  1  -  1  a l l concern changes in the p r i c e of stocks  we introduce a 1-place p r e d i c a t e named change w x y z  whose arguments are l i m i t e d in our domain to the f o l l o w i n g types: 
w: 	the p r i c e of a stock or index manifested 	in 	the t e x t by the name of the corresponding company 
x: 	an i n i t i a l value in d o l l a r s 	  f o r north 	american stocks  
y: 	a f i n a l value in d o l l a r s 
z: 	a signed value equal to the d i f f e r e n c e y-x  
although the x-value ＼s rarely expressed in stock market reports  it has been retained here   a t the risk of introducing redundancy  in order to show how very general semantic primitives may be used in particular domains  the z-value indicates the d i rection of change e x p l i c i t l y   although this directional component may be incorporated in the lexical meaning of a verb expressing change  e.g. jump and move up mean 1 z; plunge sag mean z   1     verbs may also be lexically marked for degree of change   i   e . .subjective size of z    for example  j ump   plunge signify large changes; creep up  edge up indicate small changes. figures 1 and 1 give preliminary representations for sentences  1  and  1  respectively  

two comments may be in order. first  we wee that in both figs 1 and 1 the z-values of change have subjective qualifications of amount  e.g.  large  small . moreover  the time interval over which the change takes place   i . e .   the unknown quantity l  is considered small. no value is given to the second argument of change  indicated by  -''  since no i n i t i a l value is expressed l i n g u i s t i c a l l y in either example. second  in stock market reports  company names show a s y s t e m a t i c 1-way ambiguity. bow valley can refer to a company  or i t s spokesman  or i t s stock  or the price of the stock. 
     our semantic representations are postulated on the basis of a systematic comparison of observable paraphrases within this sublanguage of english. we select as most  semantically transparant  that paraphrase which satisfies two conditions: 	 a  	a l l relevant meanings are expressed analytically  i.e. by separate words; 	 b  its words have the freest occurrence in the sublanguage  i . e .   they are the 
r. kittredge and i. mel'cuk 1 
l e a s t i d i o m a t i c . 	this semantically 	t r a n s p a r a n t paraphrase is converted i n t o a semantic r e p r e s e n t a t i o n by r e p l a c i n g the english surface s y n t a c t i c means by the l a b e l l e d arcs of our network. the r e s u l t i n g r e p r e s e n t a t i o n must meet a number of gene r a l formal requirements:  1  the f o r m a l r e p r e s e n t a t i o n language must be r i c h enough to a l l o w assigning two d i f f e r e n t representations to two sentences which are f e l t i n t u i t i v e l y to have different 
meanings;  1  representations must r e f l e c t the addi t i v i t y and c o m p o s i t i o n a l i t y of meanings  e t c . our 
use of paraphrase as an approach to d e r i v i n g sema n t i c representations is based on work by kittredge   a   . 
b. intermediate levels of representation 
     we r e s t r i c t ourselves here to the deep syntact i c l e v e l   which w e w i l l not attempt t o j u s t i f y   surface s y n t a c t i c and morphological l e v e l s are even less debatable and f a r t h e r from the semantic problems which are our main concern. figures 1 and a give two possible deep s y n t a c t i c r e a l i z a t i o n s f o r sentences whose content is represented by the n e t -
work of figure 1. 

we use unordered dependency trees in which arcs are l a b e l l e d w i t h s y n t a c t i c r e l a t i o n s o f two d i f f e r e n t types. f i r s t   we use a p r e d i c a t i v e r e l a t i o n between a term and i t s subject and objects or c o m p l e m e n t s . second  we use an a t t r i b u t i v e r e l a t i o n   which covers a l l kinds o f a t t r i b u t e s   m o d i f i e r s and a d v e r b i a l s . this l a b e l l i n g i s used t o constrain t h e o r d e r i n g and i n f l e c t i n g of l e x i c a l items at the s u p e r f i c i a l s y n t a c t i c l e v e l  not shown here . nodes of t r e e s are marked w i t h english l e x i c a l expressions or l e x i c a l functions such as magn in fig.1   see m e l ' f c u k   1     . 
c. correspondence rules 
     the smrad system uses a v a r i e t y of r u l e s f o r r e l a t i n g semantic networks to deep s y n t a c t i c dependency t r e e s . these are organized i n t o two main components:  1  l e x i c a l r u l e s   and  1  syntactic r u l e s . 
     l e x i c a l r u l e s are of two types:   i   a l e x i c a l correspondence r u l e associates an english l e x e m e   

within the boxes on the r i g h t we give any r e s t r i c t i o n s on the s y n t a c t i c form of the arguments in the s y n t a c t i c dependency t r e e . any semantic c o n s t r a i n t   e . g .   reference to semantic word classes  is given under the boxes:   i i   a l e x i c a l f u n c t i o n r u l e i n t r o duces a l e x i c a l f u n c t i o n   such as the i n t e n s i f i e r f u n c t i o n   as the s y n t a c t i c c o r r e l a t e of a s e m a n t i c subnetwork. 
     the s y n t a c t i c r u l e s specify how to put the whole s y n t a c t i c s t r u c t u r e of the sentence t o g e t h e r . they are also of two types:   i   general r u l e s give global p r i n c i p l e s f o r encoding meanings in the deep syntact i c s t r u c t u r e   e . g .     i f one verb is used to express an argument of a second v e r b   the f i r s t becomes a s y n t a c t i c a t t r i b u t e of the second' .  h  meta-rules give general p r i n c i p l e s f o r c o n s t r u c t i n g a syntactic t r e e f o r the english sentence on the basis of its se-
mantic network. it is important to s t a t e here that the network is not  consumed  in the process. i n stead  it is used as a   b l u e p r i n t   f o r t h e r u l e s which construct the t r e e . items already 'used  in the network are checked o f f in a r e c u r s i v e p r o c e s s 
u n t i l a l l parts of the network have been encoded in the s y n t a c t i c t r e e . l o g i c a l l y speaking  the r u l e s 
which do t h i s are not ordered.
