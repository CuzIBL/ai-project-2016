       many tasks i n v o l v i n g p i c t u r e s r e q u i r e the a b i l i t y to put a sensed image i n t o correspondence w i t h a reference image or map. examples include v e h i c l e guidance  photo i n t e r p r e t a t i o n  change d e t e c t i o n and monitoring  and cartography  map u p d a t i n g   . the conventional approach is to determine a l a r g e number of p o i n t s of correspondence by c o r r e l a t i n g small patches of the reference image w i t h the sensed image. a polynomial i n t e r p o l a t i o n is then used to estimate correspondence for a r b i t r a r y intermediate p o i n t s   b e r n s t e i n   . this approach is computationally expensive and l i m i t e d to cases where the reference and sensed images were obtained under s i m i l a r viewing c o n d i t i o n s . i n p a r t i c u l a r   i t cannot match images obtained from r a d i c a l l y d i f f e r e n t viewpoints  sensors  or seasonal or c l i m a t i c c o n d i t i o n s   and it cannot match images against symbolic maps. 
       parametric correspondence matches images to a symbolic reference map  r a t h e r than a reference image. the map contains a compact three dimensional r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of the shape of major landmarks  such as c o a s t l i n e s   b u i l d i n g s and roads. an a n a l y t i c camera model is used to p r e d i c t the l o c a t i o n and appearance of landmarks in the image  generating a p r o j e c t i o n for an assumed viewpoint. correspondence is achieved by a d j u s t i n g the parameters of the camera model   i . e . the assumed viewpoint  u n t i l the appearances of the landmarks o p t i m a l l y match a symbolic d e s c r i p t i o n e x t r a c t e d from the image

	chamfer 	matching 
       point landmarks such as i n t e r s e c t i o n s or promontories are represented in the map w i t h t h e i r associated three dimensional world coordinates. linear landmarks  such as roads or c o a s t l i n e s are represented as curve fragments w i t h associated ordered l i s t s o f world coordinates. volumetric s t r u c t u r e s such as b u i l d i n g s or b r i d g e s   are represented as wire frame models. 
       from a knowledge of the expected v i e w p o i n t   a p r e d i c t i o n of the image can be made by p r o j e c t i n g 
       world coordinates i n t o corresponding image coordinates  suppressing hidden l i n e s . the problem in matching is to determine how w e l l the predicted features correspond w i t h image f e a t u r e s   such as edges and l i n e s . 
       the f i r s t step is to e x t r a c t image features by applying edge and l i n e operators or t r a c i n g boundaries. edge fragment l i n k i n g  nevatia  perkins  or r e l a x a t i o n enhancement  zucker  barrow  is o p t i o n a l . the net r e s u l t is a feature array each element of which records whether or not a l i n e fragment passes through i t . this process preserves shape i n f o r m a t i o n and discards greyscale i n f o r m a t i o n   which i s less i n v a r i a n t . 
       to c o r r e l a t e the extracted feature a r r a y d i r e c t l y w i t h the p r e d i c t e d feature array would encounter several problems: the c o r r e l a t i o n peak for two arrays d e p i c t i n g i d e n t i c a l l i n e a r features is very sharp and t h e r e f o r e i n t o l e r a n t of s l i g h t misalignment or d i s t o r t i o n   e . g .   two l i n e s   s l i g h t l y r o t a t e d w i t h respect to each other  can have at most one p o i n t of correspondence    a n d r u s   ; a sharply peaked c o r r e l a t i o n surface is an i n a p p r o p r i a t e o p t i m i z a t i o n c r i t e r i o n because i t provides l i t t l e i n d i c a t i o n o f closeness t o the t r u e match  nor of the proper d i r e c t i o n in which to proceed; computational cost is heavy w i t h l a r g e feature a r r a y s   
       a more robust measure of s i m i l a r i t y between the two sets of feature p o i n t s is the sum of the distances between each predicted feature p o i n t and the nearest image p o i n t . this can be computed e f f i c i e n t l y by transforming the image feature a r r a y i n t o an array of numbers r e p r e s e n t i n g distance to the nearest image feature p o i n t . the s i m i l a r i t y

b a r r o w 

measure is then easily computed by stepping through the l i s t of predicted features and simply summing the distance array values at the predicted locations. 
　　　the distance values can be determined in two passes through the image feature array by a process known as  chamfering   munson  rosenfeld . the feature array  f i j  i . j = 1 n  is i n i t i a l l y twovalued: 1 for feature points and i n f i n i t y otherwise the forward pass modifies the feature array as follows 
for i  - 1 step 1 until n do 
for j  - 1 step 1 until n do f   i . j    - minimum f i j  	 f i 1 j +1 . 
	 f i-1 j-1 +1  	 f i j-1 +1   
 f i+1.j-1 +1  ; 
similarly  the backward pass operates as follows: 
for i  -  n-1  step -1 until 1 do 
for j  -  n-1  step -1 until 1 do 
f   i   j    - minimum f i j    f i+1 j +1   
	 f i+1 j*1 *1   	 f i j+1 +1  
 f i-1.j+1 +1  ; 
the incremental distance values of 1 and 1 provide relative distances that approximate the euclidean distances 1 and the square root of 1 
　　　chamfer matching provides an efficient way of computing the integral distance   i . e . 	area  	or integral squared distance  between two curve fragments  two commonly used measures of shape similarity. 	note that the distance array is computed only once  after image feature extraction. 
parametric  correspondence 
　　　parametric correspondence puts an image into correspondence with a three dimensional reference map by determining the parameters of an analytic camera model  1 position and 1 orientation parameters . 
　　　the traditional method of calibrating the camera model takes place in two stages: f i r s t   a number of known landmarks are independently located in the image  and second  the camera parameters are computed from the pairs of corresponding world and image locations  by solving an over-constrained set of equations  sobel  quara  hannah . 
　　　the failings of the traditional method stem from the f i r s t stage. 	the landmarks are found individually  using only very local context  e.g. a small patch of surrounding image  and with no mutual constraints. 	thus local false matches commonly occur. 	the restriction to small features is mandated by the high cost of area correlation  and by the fact that large image features correlate poorly over small changes in viewpoint. 
　　　parametric correspondence overcomes these failings by integrating the landmark-matching and camera calibration stages. it operates by h i l l climbing on the camera parameters. a transformation matrix is constructed for each set of parameters considered  and it is used to project landmark descriptions from the map onto the image at a particular translation  rotation  scale and 
v 1 s ! o n - 1 : 
1 
perspective. a similarity score is computed with chamfer matching and used to update parameter values. i n i t i a l parameter values are estimated from navigational data. 
　　　integrating the two stages allows the simultaneous matching of a l l landmarks in their correct spatial relationships. viewpoint problems with extended features are avoided because features are precisely projected by the camera model prior to matching. parametric correspondence has the same advantages as rubber-sheet template matching  fischler  widrow  in that it obtains the best embedding of a map in an image  but avoids the combinatorics of trying arbitrary distortions by only considering those corresponding to some possible viewpoint. 
an example 
　　　the following example illustrates the major concepts in chamfer matching and parametric correspondence. 	a sensed image  figure 1  was input along with manually derived i n i t i a l estimates of the camera parameters. 	a reference map of the coastline was obtained  using a digitizing tablet to encode coordinates of a set of 1 sample points on a usgs map 	elevations for the points were entered manually. 	figure 1 is an orthographic projection of this three dimensional map. 
　　　a simple edge follower traced the high contrast boundary of the harbor  producing the edge picture shown in figure 1. the chamfering algorithm was applied to this edge array to obtain a distance array. figure u depicts this distance array; distance is encoded by brightness with maximum brightness corresponding to zero distance from an edge point. 
　　　using the i n i t i a l camera parameter estimates  the map was projected onto the sensed image  figure 1 . the average distance between projected points and the nearest edge point  as determined by chamfer matching  was 1 pixels. 
　　　a straightforward optimization algorithm adjusted the camera parameters  one at a time  to minimize the average distance. figures 1 and 1 show an intermediate state and the final state  in which the average distance has been reduced to 1 
　　　pixels. this result  obtained with 1 sample points  compares favorably with a 1 pixel average distance for 1 sample points obtained using conventional image chip correlation followed by camera calibration. the curves in figure 1 characterize the local behavior of this minimum  showing how average distance varies with variation of each parameter from i t s optimal value. approximately 1 iterations  each involving a parameter adjustment and reprojection . were required for this example. the number of iterations could be reduced by using a better optimization algorithm  for example  a gradient search 
dscussion. 
　　　we have presented a scheme for establishing correspondence between an image and a reference map that integrates the processes of landmark matching and camera calibration. the potential advantages 
barrow 
of this approach stem from 1  matching shape  rather than brightness  1  matching spatially extensive features  rather than small patches of image  1  matching simultaneously to all features  rather than searching the combinatorial space of alternative local matches  1  using a compact three dimensional model; rather than many two dimensional templates. 
     snape has proved to be much easier to model and predict than brightness. 	shape is a relatively invariant geometric property whose appearance from arbitrary viewpoints can be precisely predicted by the camera model. 	this eliminates the need for 
multiple descriptions  corresponding to different viewing conditions  and overcomes difficulties of matching large features over small changes of viewpoint. 
     the ability to treat the entirety of the relevant portion of the reference map as a single extensive feature reduces significantly the risk of ambiguous matches  and avoids the combinatorial complexity of finding the optimal embedding of multiple local features. 
     a number of obstacles have been encountered ir reducing the above ideas to practice the distance metric used in chamfer matching provides a smooth  monotonia measure near the correct correspondence  and nicely interpolates over gaps in curves. however  scores can be unreliable when image and reference are badly out of alignment. in particular  discrimination is poor in textured areas  aliasing can occur with parallel linear features  a single isolated image feature can support multiple reference features. 
     the main problem is that edge position is not a distinguishing feature and consequently many alternative matches receive equal weight. one way of overcoming this problem  therefore  is to use more descriptive features brightness discontinuities can be classified  for example  by orientation  by edge or line  and by local spatial context  texture versus isolated boundary . each type of feature would be separately chamfered and 
map features would be matched in the appropriate array. similarly  features at a much higher level could be used  such as promontory or bay  area features having particular internal textures or structures  and even specific landmarks  such as  the top of the transamerica pyramid . ideally  with a few highly differentiated features distributed widely over the image the earanietric correspondence process would be able to home in directly on the solution regardless of initial conditions. 
     another dimension for possible improvement is the chamfering process itself. determining for each point of the array a weighted sum of distances to many features  e.g. a convolution with the feature array   instead of the distance to the nearest feature  would provide more immunity from isolated noise points. alternatively  propagating the coordinates of the nearest point instead of 
merely the distance to i t   it becomes possible to use characteristics of features  such as local slope or curvature  in evaluating the goodness of match. it also makes possible a more directed search  since corresponding pairs of points are now known  an improved set of parameter estimates can be analytically determined. 
     chamfer matching and parametric correspondence are separable techniques. conceptually  parametric correspondence can be performed by re projecting image chips and evaluating the match with correlation. however  the cost of projection and matching grows with the square of the template size: the cost for chamfer matching grows linearly with the number of feature points. chamfer matching is an alternative to other shape matching 
techniques  such as chain-oode correlation  freeman   fourier matching  zahn   and graph matching  e.g. davis . also  the smoothing obtained by transforming two edge arrays to distance arrays via chamfering can be used to improve the robustness of conventional area-based edge correlation. 
     parametric correspondence  in its most general form  is a technique for matching two parametrically related representations of the same geometric structure. the representations can be two- or three-dimensional  iconic or symbolic; the parametric relation can be perspective projection  a simple similarity transformation  a polynomial warp  and so forth. this view is similar to rubber-sheet template matching as conceived by fischler and widrow  fischler  widrow . the feasibility of the approach in any application  as widrow points out  depends on efficient algorithms for  pattern stretching  hypothesis testing  and pattern memory   corresponding to our camera model  chamfer matching  and three dimensional map. 
     as an illustration of its versatility  the technique can be used with a known camera looation to find a known object whose position and orientation are known only approximately. in this case  the object's position and orientation are the parameters; the object is translated and rotated until its projection best matches the image data such an application has a more iconic flavor  as advocated by shepard  shepard   and is more integrated than the traditional feature extraction and graph matching approach  roberts  falk and grape . 
     as a final consideration  the approach is amenable to efficient hardware implementation. there already exists commercially available hardware for generating parametrically specified perspective views of wire frame models at video rates  complete with hidden line suppression. the chamfering process itself requires only two passes through an array by a local operator  and match scoring requires only summing table lookups in the resulting distance array. 
conclusion 
vision-1: barrow 1      iconic matching techniques  such as correlation  are known for efficiency and precision obtained by exploiting all available pictorial information  especially geometry. however  they are overly sensitive to changes in viewing conditions and cannot make use of non-pictorial information. symbolic matching techniques  on the other hand  are more robust because they rely on

a query has been satisfied  the template node is represented by instantiated nodes with attached specialized location descriptions as shown in figure 1. four basic types of links provide a simple syntax to the network structure. a powerful advantage to this syntax is that the executive procedure can direct the analysis in a more general way. 

1 constraints 
　　　links to other model nodes encode  perhaps parametrized  constraint relations between model nodes. links can encode: 
- the probability that the relationship holds; 
- a quantifier representing the expected value of the relationship; 
- conditions under which the relationship holds. 
for example  the relationship ship adjacent dock might have a certain probability of being true  an expected distance that the ship is from the dock  and conditions for the relation being true. we refer to the template nodes and geometric relations between them as the constraint network. this network may be interpreted like a program to find subsets of the model or the image that satisfy the constraints. its results take account of partial or unspecified information  and it may be updated upon receipt of better data with a minimal amount of work. it is much like the graph of variable dependencies in al  feldman et a l . 1 . in brief  each node has a  constraint operation   such as intersection  translation  union  or indeed any function of up to two arguments; it has two operand nodes; a father node; a status that may be  up-to-date  or  out-of-date ; and a value that is some data structure such as a number  a l i s t of linear objects  a region  etc. 
　　　the constraint network for the prose:  the centroids of docked ships are on lines parallel to the intersection of coastlines with dock areas at a distance of one-half a ship width  is shown 

　　　the network starts out with data  from the model or from previous scene analysis  as the values of the tip nodes  but no values at nonterminal nodes and all nonterminals marked out-ofdate. data at a tip node can have one of three statuses: it can be known that the object does not exist in the scene  so the value of the node is the null set   it can be known to some degree of accuracy where objects are in the scene  so the value of the node is a subset of image or world points   or perhaps nothing is known  in which case the object could be anywhere  and the value is implicitly the universe of image or world points . 
　　　when the constraint network is  run  to determine what is known about the location of its object  each node recursively evaluates its out-of-date operand nodes  performs its operation  and stores the result in its value. it marks its status up-to-date. intersection and union work properly with the definitions of partial information of the last paragraph. when new  or better  information about an object at a tip of the graph comes i n   all nodes on a path from the t i p to the root are marked out-of-date. then when the graph is next run   only  the necessary partial results are re-computed. in keeping with our philosophy  the graph is not self-activating  but is run on explicit user command. 
1 	location descriptors 
　　　a location descriptor provides information about where to find an entity. the part of the location descriptor which specifies a point set enclosing the region has been referred to as a tolerance region  bolles 1 . a shape location descriptor might have the structure shown in figure 1. 
v i s i o n - 1 : b a l l a r d 
1 　　　this organization is suggestive of a framelike structure. however  not all the entries need exist; just the syntax is necessary to allow the entries to be found. in practice only the 
properties relevant to a particular query will be generated. such partial instantiations are easy in our implementation language leap  feldman & rovner 1 .

     there are many advantages to having a standard representation for object locations: 
1. control 
1 general philosophy 
     generally a query results in the synthesis of a sketchmap with instance nodes whose location descriptors are accurate enough for the purposes of the query. a query might also result in further refinement of location descriptors of the extension of an existing sketchmap to account for more image structure. a query-directed vision system should thus be able to use relevant information generated in successive queries. most queries will take the form of user-written programs  since nontrivial tasks usually require fairly rigid recommendations about how the system should go about solving them. initially the system will not attack the problem of automatically translating queries in some command language into programs. at the highest level control is embedded in the form of a user-written executive program. figure 1 shows a fragment of the code used in the current executive procedure for selecting mapping procedures which identify instances of rib nodes in chest radiograph images. each mapping procedure has pre-conditions  including an associated accuracy measure  which can depend on its neighbors  as well as a cost measure. the cheapest rib procedure which satisfies the pre-conditions is selected. the important point here is that the 
a. if such descriptions are data types  their computations can be separated from the procedures that use them. if they can be passed as arguments  they provide a certain  common currency  between procedures  thus simplifying and modularizing the procedures that use them. 
b. location descriptors can represent approx-imate locations  which is useful for queries unconcerned with exact answers. 
c. constraints between locations can propa-gate knowledge throughout the model. location descriptors can be computed from other location descriptors via relations  or by union and intersection of the described point sets. a system which applied linear programming techniques to the problem of locating regions through constraints placed on their boundaries was developed in  taylor 1 . 
d. use of location descriptors is geared to an abandonment of the exhaustive segmentation paradigm wherein every region must correspond to some object. different location descriptors may refer to disjoint point sets or may overlap on the image  and different objects may have similar location descriptors. 
vision-1: b a l l a r d 
1 executive can have a relatively simple structure. this facilitates the experimentation of various control strategies other than the depth-first strategy shown in the example. 

1 characterizations of mapping procedures 
     mapping procedures have associated descriptions which are used by executive procedures  the descriptions contain the following: 
- the slots in the data object which must be f i l l e d for the procedure to run; 
- the slots the procedure can f i l l i n ; 
- the cost and accuracy of the procedure in some meaningful units; 
- the a priori r e l i a b i l i t y of the procedure. examples of the kinds of facts we expect to be able to encode in this structure are  for a straight-line structure  that a hough transform cannot find the endpoints of a line but is more reliable than the cheaper shirai tracker  which i t s e l f needs to know the direction of a line before it can track i t   and that a heuckel operator is more expensive  but can furnish many facts about the line with l i t t l e known a p r i o r i   and can rate i t s e l f on r e l i a b i l i t y of its result. 
　　　there are several advantages to separating the executive procedure from the mapping procedures and their descriptions: 
a. the executive procedure can be written without considering the implementation details of mapping procedures in great depth. 
b. mapping procedures are similarly simpli-fied without the burden of determining an appropriate context for their application. 
c. the executive procedure can automatically select alternative procedures in the event of mapping procedure failures. 
d. descriptions allow a choice between 
methods   i f several are available  based on capability  resource requirements  and a priori r e l i a b i l i t y .  also  recovery from failure of individual routines can be automated through planning  feldman and sproull 1 .  
e. if the mapping procedures can produce 
reliable a priori estimates of their success  the analytical results of  bolles 1  and  taylor 1  could be extended to select the procedure which produces sufficiently exact data objects.

　　　the model contains in a constraint graph form  see section 1  the knowledge that docked ships are in the ocean adjacent to dock areas  parallel to the dock and with centroid a distance away related to the width of the ship. 	in a shape object descriptor  some facts about the sorts of ships we are trying to find are stored  viz. a template for matching them  in our case  a rectangle of l's in an array for templatematching   their width  length  average brightness  etc. template-matching is among the simplest vision primitives. only in a context having a great deal of structure could it be expected to work in scenes as complex as figure 1 . 1 . 
　　　the system  under direction of the userwritten query  begins by deciding where to look by satisfying a constraint network; the more infor-
mation provided  the narrower the focus of attention. in the case illustrated in this section  the constraint network looked as it does in section 1. figure 1 shows a halftoned version of the image  with the dock area and coastline overlaid as black lines. recent work at sri  barrow and tenenbaum 1  has shown that map data may be automatically registered with images such as ours to within better than a pixel  so we felt comfortable about bypassing the registration problem in this study. were the registration uncertain  the constraints would produce a more fuzzy area to search than they did. shown in the ocean are black lines indicating the areas of search which arise from the constraint tree; their linear nature makes a simple template-matching technique a possibility  in this exercise it was the only technique  but an executive procedure might well have chosen it as applicable . the ship template is rotated to be parallel to the midline as given by the constraint graph  and templatematching is done along the line; note is taken of where the score for the match goes over threshold  and when it comes back down under threshold. the average of these two positions is taken as the location of a ship. the black crosses show the results. 
　　　our image data is a usgs mapping photograph provided by sri  digitized to 1 grey levels on a .1  grid at usc. the image is stored on disk in rv format  and can be sampled at integral size reductions into an integer array in core for processing  see  maleson & rashid 1  re. rv format . 
　　　linear objects are sail records making linked lists of  x y  points. they can have four types at present: a l i s t of points to be connected in order; a l i s t of segments  or pairs of endpoints to be connected pairwise; and logically circular lists of points representing boundaries. a robust and general routine based on merging was written to compute the intersection of such linear features. other useful geometric routines find the distance of a point from a segment  not a l i n e     and compute a segment parallel to and some distance from another segment. 
　　　regions  except for templates  which are arrays  are sail l i s t items. a region is a l i s t of y - l i s t s ; a y - l i s t has a y-value followed by an even number of x-values. the f i r s t x-value is an  entering region  boundary point  the second is a  leaving region  boundary point  and so on alternately. the region: 1

would be represented as   1 1  1 1 1  1 1  . routines were written  again based on merging  to create the union and intersection of such regions  and to convert  via an asvmmetric dda algorithm  newman and sproull 1   linear objects to regions. we find multiple representations of objects simplifies the work of routines such as the constraint primitives. 
     template-matching utilities can produce an array containing a rotated and scaled version of a template and can compute the correlation of a template  at some rotation and translation  with the image array.

1 	finding ribs in chest radiographs 
     the problem of finding ribs in chest radiographs illustrates the use of multiple procedures attached to the same template node and the use of less precise geometric constraints arising from anatomy rather than cartography. 
     the model contains nine right and left ribs  the maximum amount normally visible on a chest film . presently only the lower edge of each rib is detected. each rib is modelled as a template node with offset parameters from itself to each immediate neighbor  above  below  opposite . additionally  three kinds of procedures are attached to each rib node as shown in table 1. 
     lookforarib uses the weschler parabolic model  weschler & sklansky 1  to find a rib segment. 
affirmarib translates that segment using the offset parameters and attempts to verify the presence of a rib by a correlation technique. hallucinatearib instantiates a rib by translating a neighbor with no verification.

     figure 1 shows the result of finding ribs on a particular chest film. the ribs are labelled with special symbols to denote the procedures which located them.

1. summary 
     the semantic network is a kind of lumped parameter model in the spirit of  fischler and eschlager 1 . the geometric constraints in the network relate template nodes whose descriptions  the  lumped parameters   are generated by attached mapping procedures. the key difference is that information found during the analysis can change the way template nodes are located. 
     in analyzing an image it is crucial that the generating of abstract descriptions of parts of the image  segmentation  be intimately connected with the interpretation of those parts. in our system the former operation corresponds to generating sketchmap-image links whereas the latter corresponds to generating model-sketchmap links. interpretation and segmentation are united through multiple mapping procedures and the executive  which can efficiently change the way a part of the image is analyzed as new information about the rest of the image develops. 
     finally  we want the image analysis process to do as l i t t l e work as possible to satisfy a given task or query. this is attempted through the specialization of all parameters to the given task  the inclusion of performance and accuracy measures in the mapping procedure descriptions  and the use of the constraint network. all of this is just the beginning of a long term effort to study what can be done in a general way for goal directed image understanding tasks.
