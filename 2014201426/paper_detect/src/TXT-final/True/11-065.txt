           experience w i t h the mycin   1   therapy s e l e c t o r shows that a c l e a n l y s t r u c t u r e d a l g o r i t h m makes possible a si.-nple  but u s e f u l explanation c a p a b i l i t y . the a l g o r i t h m uses the generate and t e s t method to select a small set of drugs f o r a d m i n i s t r a t i o n to a patient having an i n f e c t i o u s disease. traces of the a p p l i c a t i o n of medical s t r a t e g i e s are l e f t behind f o r l a t e r s e l e c t i v e r e t r i e v a l and p r i n t i n g by the explanation system. these s t r a t e g i e s are r e a d i l y comprehensible to the user of the program because they are based on e x i s t i n g c l i n i c a l r a t i o n a l e f o r s e l e c t i n g a n t i b i o t i c s  as opposed to using an e v a l u a t i o n p o l y n o m i a l   f o r example.  
           the 	generate 	and 	t e s t 	a l g o r i t h m 	is described as a s e r i e s of steps through 	which each recommended drug must 	proceed s u c c e s s f u l l y : 

each step corresponds to a subset operation on surviving candidates from the previous step. the predicate of the subset operation is the collection of medical strategies which characterize the drugs at each step. as shown in the diagram above  these steps are: 
orgdrug - the drug is one of the drugs which might be prescribed for an organism requiring therapy 
rank - the preference ranking of the drug  as determined by sensitivity information and whether it is a current therapy 
proposed - the drug is being considered as part of the regi.men for this patient: 
the generator selects subsets of drugs for testing under the control of instructions which specify how many drugs to select from the preference categories  e.g.   propose 1 drugs: one second choice and one third choice.  instructions for regimens containing 1 or 1 drugs are taken from a static l i s t ; for regimens containing 1 or more drugs  instructions are generated from a simple pattern. instructions are ordered to conform to clinical practice for selecting therapy. thus  two second choice drugs w i l l be proposed before a combination of a second and third chojce drug. 
drugclass  -- does the possible regimen include 1 drugs from the same drug group  
  e . g .   the penicillins  
coverage  - does the possible regimen cover for a l l of the organisms that require therapy  
approved  - are 	there contraindications for this regimen  	  e . g .   allergic reaction  
prescribed - the drug is one of recommended for this patient the 	drugs 	this 	l i s t 	of 	steps 	is maintained separately from the algorithm  and i t   along with l i s t s of 	medical c r i t e r i a 	applied at each step  constitute a  static  event structure which is used by the explanation system to retrieve traces. the medical c r i t e r i a are referred to as positive and negative reasons  because a recital of the chain of positive reasons w i l l serve as an explanation for why a drug was prescribed. similarly  the occurrence of a negative characterization during the execution of the algorithm w i l l serve as an explanation for why a drug was not prescribed  e.g.  the drug was rejected because laboratory tests showed that the organism is resistant to i t . the event structure may be thought of as a state-transition diagram of the algorithm  specifying steps  states  and reasons why a drug makes it to the next step 
 transit ions . 
         in summary: 1  the algorithm leaves behind a trace indicating which medical c r i t e r i a were applied to each drug  this constitutes a  dynamic  event history  and 1  the explanation subprogram retrieves the relevant traces for a particular drug by  reading  the  static  event structure of the algorithm which l i s t s the medical c r i t e r i a which might have been applied at each step. the retrieval process is therefore domain independent  permitting the explanation program to be separable from the knowledge base. 
         we find that this simple process of retrieving traces works because 1  the number of traces is relatively small  there are fewer than 1 drugs and usually fewer than 1 proposals ; 1  the steps of ranking drugs  proposing and testing regimens are readily comprehensible to the user because they attempt to mimic his heuristics for selecting therapy; 1  the explanation subprogram has one basic question:  why was n't  a particular drug prescribed for a particular organism    greatly simplifying the organization of traces.
