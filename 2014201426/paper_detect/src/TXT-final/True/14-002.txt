	i 	introduction 
　　　this paper describes a method f o r object recognition using three-dimensional data of a scene. our aim is to deal w i t h scenes which have the f o l l o w i n g features: 
 1  objects are placed in any 1-d p o s i t i o n w i t h any o r i e n t a t i o n . 
 1  objects may be stacked in a bcene. 
 1  objects 	have 	planar 	and/or 	smoothly 	curved surfaces. 
　　　recognition of r e a l objects has been studied aiming at r e a l i z a t i o n of automatic i n s p e c t i o n   assembly and so on. for t h i s purpose  the recognition method should be f l e x i b l e and e f f i c i e n t enough to analyze scenes w i t h stacked objects and recognize them. it is w e l l known that even r e c o g n i t i o n of a simple object is not easy if the object is allowed to r o t a t e in 1-d space. the shape i d e n t i f i c a t i o n methods using a monocular gray p i c t u r e   l   1  assumed many c o n s t r a i n t s on input scenes. recognition of scenes w i t h stacked objects was studied f o r simple scenes   1   . 
       if range data la a v a i l a b l e   more f l e x i b l e r e c o g n i t i o n can be achieved because 1-d shapes of objects are d i r e c t l y obtained. in order to analyze a scene w i t h m u l t i p l e objects occluding one another  it is often necessary to make a scene d e s c r i p t i o n which includes useful information f o r r e c o g n i t i o n . 	there have been 	several 	studies 	on scene 	d e s c r i p t i o n 	using 	range data   1 - 1   . 	some 
methods assumed p l a n a r i t y on objects   1  1  1  . sugihara  proposed a way for t r i h e d r a l o b j e c t s . agin   1     and nevatia and binford  described a scene i n c l u d i n g curved objects w i t h generalized c y l i n d e r s . although the method is advantageous in describing body which possesses considerable elongation  there may a r i s e some d i f f i c u l t i e s f o r other kind of o b j e c t s . we have developed a method which describes a scene w i t h planar and smoothly curved surfaces   1   . the method is applicable to general scenes w i t h r e a l o b j e c t s . recognition of objects usually requires pattern matching process: matching a part of a scene d e s c r i p t i o n to a part of an object model. the c o n t r o l strategy for matching is important in processing a complex scene. the b l i n d search is i n e f f i c i e n t under circumstances where objects are stacked and the p o s i t i o n and o r i e n t a t i o n of them are not known a p r i o r i . our system  at f i r s t   t r i e s to get r e l i a b l e and u s e f u l features of a 
scene and to match them to models so that the r e s u l t may guide the f u r t h e r processing. thus the system r e a l i z e s f l e x i b l e and e f f i c i e n t r e c o g n i t i o n .

ii outline 
　　the system works in two phases: learning and recognition as shown in fig. 1. in learning phase  known objects are shown to the system one by one. the system makes a description of a scene in terms of properties of regions  surfaces  and their relations. the description is stored as a model of an object. if one view is not enough to build a model of an object  several typical views are system

  1  classify the elementary regions into planar and curved ones  fig. 1 d  .

be seen in the scene  regions in the scene are picked up one by one  and are matched to those of the model o b j e c t . 
       s t a r t i n g from a k e r n e l   the system t r i e s to e s t a b l i s h a correspondence between scene regions and model regions and to f i n d a l l the regions of the object in the scene. at each step  the system selects a new region sn among those which are adjacent to known regions  that i s   the regions which have been selected and matched in the e a r l i e r s t e p s   . again eq. l  is used f o r the s e l e c t i o n of a new region. 
　　　whenever s n is selected from the scene  the corresponding region is searched for in the model. the search is based on the d i s s i m i l a r i t y function which evaluates d i s s i m i l a r i t y of properties and that of r e l a t i o n s between s n and supposed model region mui.   see f i g . 1   . 

　　　the function compares properties of the region p l   s n   w i t h that of the region in the model pp mui*   the f u n c t i o n also compares r e l a t i o n s q  s n s i ;  between sn and the known regions si of the same object w i t h those q m   m u i . m i   of the corresponding regions m u i and m i . in the model. suppose the number of already known regions is k. 
the d i s s i m i l a r i t y of region s n and m u i is defined as f o l l o w s : 

where p 1 and t m denote weights. note that the areas are used as weights so that more r e l i a b l e regions contribute more to f 1 . 
       the region w i t h minimum f 1 is chosen. if the value is small enough  the match is considered to be acceptable. generally if a surface of an object is not f u l l y seen  the region may not pass the t e s t and it may remain unknown. however  if a plane is p a r t i a l l y occluded by other surfaces  the type and the d i r e c t i o n of the region are not affected by the occlusion. such a planar r e g i o n   t h e r e f o r e   is determined to match a model region if the d l s s i m i l a r l t y of corresponding r e l a t i v e d i r e c t i o n is s u f f i c i e n t l y small  1-d p o s i t i o n correspondence is good enough  and the area of the region is less than that of the model. 
　　　when a matching process for a model terminates  the system checks if the assumption is acceptable or not. if enough p o r t i o n of the model is found  the system concludes that it has found an object that is i d e n t i c a l to the assumed model. the p o s i t i o n and o r i e n t a t i o n of the object are calculated from the correspondence of the regions. 

	v 	experimental results 
       experiments are made to recognize two kinds of scenes: one w i t h blocks and one w i t h machine p a r t s . in the f i r s t experiment  ten kinds of objects w i t h planar and/or quadratic curved surfaces  shown in f i g . 1  are used for object models.

in the second experiment  machine parts  pulley  liner  piston  and conrod of a car  are used for object models. figure 1 shows an example of an input image. figure 1 shows elementary regions. 
in fig. 1  the result of recognition is shown. experiments for several similar scenes were so far satisfactory. the processing time for a typical scene such as shown in fig. 1 is about 1 min. for description and 1 min. for matching.

vi conclusion 
　　　we have proposed a system to recognize stacked objects using range data. the system describes a scene in terms of planes and smoothly curved surfaces. models of objects are b u i l t in the system by showing them one by one. objects are recognized by matching the d e s c r i p t i o n of an input scene to those of models. the matching program picks up regions which are most r e l i a b l e and u s e f u l for r e c o g n i t i o n   and matches them to those of a 
　　　model o b j e c t . once a candidate model is chosen  then by a guidance of the model  the rest of the scene regions are searched f o r . thus the system has realized f l e x i b l e and e f f i c i e n t r e c o g n i t i o n . the r e s u l t of experiments shows that t h i s scheme is promising.
