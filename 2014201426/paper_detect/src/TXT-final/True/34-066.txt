　　　1. a programme f o r man-machine communication  using a f u l l - f l e d g e d analysis of natural language  is being prepared by l i n g u i s t s working at the faculty of mathematics and physics  charles univ e r s i t y   prague. the algorithms that are formulated are divided i n t o the following groups: 
　　　  i   grammatical analysis of input texts   i . e . of czech texts on e l e c t r o n i c s     y i e l d i n g unambiguous semantic representations of subsequent sentences   i n the form of linearized dependency 
graphs ; 
　　　  i i   algorithms t r a n s l a t i n g from the semantic representations  which s t i l l have a l i n g u i s t i c character  i n t o a l o g i c a l language  w e l l adapted to the purposes of the theory of inference e t c . ; in t h i s form the information gained from the natu r a l language input is to be stored in the computer memory  and confronted w i t h further such informa t i o n   gained l a t e r from other t e x t s   ; 
	  i i i   	algorithms looking for information 
needed according to questions formulated by the users in czech and analyzed according to the 
algorithms of   i   ; 
　　　  i v   algorithms of the synthesis of answers   i n 	czech . 
　　　we want to characterize in the present paper the s o l u t i o n of two problems that appeared c r u c i a l f o r   i   and   i i     as w e l l as f o r the form of the semantic representations  sr 's  of sentences  the language serving as the output of   i   and input of   i i     among other purposes . 
　　　1. l i n g u i s t i c considerations have led to the following form of sr's  where every a stands f o r a l e x i c a l u n i t   accompanied  possibly  by markers of  morphological meanings   grammatemes   such as p l u r a l   p r e t e r i t e   e t c .   the subscript denoting the function of the given item in the sentence: actor  objective  dative  place  d i r e c t i o n   e t c .   : 
　　　each of the p a r t i c i p a n t s   denoted here as a   can  of course  i t s e l f consist in a group headed by the verb  so that a structure of the shape  1  may be embedded  under certain conditions  specified by a generative grammar using dependency syntax  i n t o another such s t r u c t u r e . 
　　　the superscript b is attached to those e l e ments that are contextually bound  i.e. included in the t o p i c ; the others constitute the comment or the focus of the sentence. the l e f t - t o - r i g h t order  with topic preceding the focus  may be regarded as a  deep  word order  corresponding to the primary word order of the surface l e v e l  combined with a neutral i n t o n a t i o n   . with a  hypersentence  of the ross-sadock type an 1r can be paraphrased as  i t e l l you about topic that focus   e . g .  i t e l l you about  father  that he  is coming.  i t e l l you 
1 
about  reading newspapers  that it  can be boring.  i t a l l you about the fact  that mabel came yesterday  that i t   was s u r p r i s i n g . 
　　　we consider the topic/focus dichotomy as r e levant for the l i n g u i s t i c aspects of man-machine communication for the following reasons:  a  the semantic content is organized in natural language in a d i f f e r e n t way than in formal l o g i c a l languages  one of the main distinctions consisting in that what is rendered  e . g . in predicate l o g i c   by the order of q u a n t i f i e r s   ia expressed in natu r a l language  together with some other phenomena  by the a r t i c u l a t i o n of the sentence into topic and focus and by the so-called scale of communicative dynamism  cd  r e a l i z e d   in the surface sentences  by certain features of word order and intonation  and denoted in our shape of sr' s by the l e f t - t o - r i g h t order of p a r t i c i p a n t s   . as the exam ales in the appendix show  these phenomena are crucial for one of the moat basic discussions in contemporary l i n g u i s t i c s  that between chomskian and lakovian wings in tg  and can be treated adequately if the topic/focus dichotomy is duly accounted f o r . 
 b  an account of the dichotomy is not a mere queation of l i n g u i s t i c theory  but has a considerable impact on applications concerning the use of computers as already garvin claimed  . 
 c  winograd  1  p.1  wants to represent knowledge in an imperative form  so that not only the declarations as such  but also the way they are to be used should be s p e c i f i e d . it must be noticed that in natural language  contrary to predicate logic  a declarative sentence is constructed not merely aa an assertion  but as an i n s t r u c t i o n to the hearer what f a m i l i a r  known  already foregrounded in his memory  items he should pick up and modify somehow  combining them with new propert i e s   or bringing them into new relations with other items  e t c .   . this i n t r o d u c t i o n - l i k e character of a sentence underlies i t s appropriateness to be used at a certain point of the discourse or t e x t   or more broadly  in a certain s i t u a t i o n ; if we have just spoken about george  we say george met paul  while having spoken about paul  we say rather paul was met by george or it was george who met paul.  in these simple examples  the two variants have identical t r u t h conditions  but in 
the general case t h i s does not hold  c f . the examplea in the appendix.  
　　　our treatment of topic and focus  which f o l lows  as f o r an empirical analysis  the t r a d i t i o n of czech l i n g u i s t i c s   r e l a t i v e l y r i c h in t h i s respect   is characterized in more d e t a i l in   where also a c r i t i c a l commentary on chomsky s rather incomplete account of focus is given; it is shown there that operative and testable c r i t e r i a such as the question t e s t   the test of negation  properties of e n c l i t i c a l pronouns in some languages can be used to determine both the scale of communicative dynamism  which is an older but more precise formulation of what chomsky calls  range of permissible focus   and the dichotomy of topic  chomsky's and jackendoff s  presupposition   and focus  the t r a d i t i o n a l comment or rheme . 
　　　1. some important questions concerning sr s can be solved only if the position of negation is wall understood. it is w e l l known today that meaning proper must be distinguished from presuppositions  or  more precisely  that three types of l i n g u i s t i c units must be distinguished  if the assertion a ia l o g i c a l l y entailed by the given sr  in a certain s i t u a t i o n and content   than: 
　　　 a  the negation of the given sr  neg-sr  l o g i c a l l y e n t a i l s neg-a; in t h i s case  a belongs to the meaning proper of the sentences corresponding 
to that sr; 
　　　 b  neg-sr l o g i c a l l y e n t a i l s a; here a is a 
presupposition: 
　　　 c  neg-1r l o g i c a l l y entails neither a  nor neg-a; in t h i s case  a is an a l l e g a t i o n . 
　　　in such examples as  1  or  1  the entailed items  1  and  1   respectively  are allegations: thoy are not entailed by the negation of  1  or   1     and neither their negations are. on the other hand  if the relevant part of the sentence is contextually bound  the entailed item is presupposed; thus  1  presupposes  1   since not only  1  but also i t s negation entails   1   .  the capital l e t t e r s in the examples denote the bearer of the intonation 
centre.

　　　an explanation offers i t s e l f in terms of the scope of negation: as our investigations of negation have shown  in the primary  unmarked  case  the scope of negation in specified on the left-hand side of the scale of cd by the position of the operator of negation and on the right-hand side by the end of the semantic representation of the sentence. the operator of negation stands either immediately before or immediately after the boundness juncture. {we use the term boundness juncture for the boundary between the contextually bound and the non-bound elementa of the sr   p r i m a r i l y   the verb is non-bound   i t predicates something about the t o p i c     and the scope of negation extends from the boundnees juncture to the end of the semantic representation  he didn't coke yesterday.  cf.  1  below . whet is negated here  is the r e l a t i o n between tne bound segment  the topic  and the f o cus. in the secondary case  where the verb is cont e x t u a l l y bound  there are two p o s s i b i l i t i e s : the negation of assertion with the scope of negation from the boundness juncture to the end of the semantic representation   i t wasp' t yesterday he came.  c f .  1  below   or the negation of predication  where the scope of negation includes the verb alone   i t was yesterday he d i d n ' t come.  cf.  1 ; the end of the scope of negation is the boundness j u n c t u r e   . thus  the following three p o s s i b i l i t i e s of the placement of the operator of negation and of the scope of negation with regard to the position of the boundness juncture are accounted for in the functional generative description: 

where v is understood to stand - as f o r the scale of communicative dynamism - a f t e r a l l ccntextually bound elements  with an additional specification s t a t i n g that neg precedes v if the boundness juncture does not intervene . notice that  1  ia the 
 1  only the verb ia negated  which corresponds to a   l e x i c a l negation  rather than to a negation of the sr as such. an allegation is entailed only by a sentence where the element determining it is not in the scope of negation  which does not necessari l y coincide with the focus   but where the element determining an allegation is not connected with a corresponding presupposition* i . e . when the determining element is included in the scope of negation 
 as e . g . countries that     in the negation of  1    the corresponding statement is no longer e n t a i l e d . meaning proper  assertion  consists in the r e l a t i o n s h i p between what is talked about and what is said about i t : in the sentence  the speaker asserts something   i d e n t i f i e d by the focus  about something   i d e n t i f i e d by the contextually bound segment ; if the focus is negated  then the corresponding negative statement is e n t a i l e d . 
　　　1. taking into account also the delimiting features  such as d e f i n i t e   i n d e f i n i t e   specif y i n g     the shape of an sr as given in  1  should be complemented in the following way: 

where the indices of the form m j specify l e x i c a l u n i t s   the indices of the form k. specify the 
 cases   participants  syntactic functions  1 and 
p  stands f o r one of the operators spec  def  
indef  ev  few  many  i . e . for d e l i m i t i n g features  understood here in the sense of bierwisch ; for a discussion cf  ; for the purpose of our present discussion  we class here also many and few as delimiting features . the formula  1  r e presents an sr of a sentence with a contextually non-bound verb; if the verb is contextually bound  then  / is attached a superscript b.. 
　　　we assume that it is possible to formulate a procedure t r a n s l a t i n g the sr s to a formal language sharing the advantages of predicate calculus  with i t s rules of inference  e t c .     but lacking some of i t s drawbacks  connected with the w e l l known f a c t that the formulae of the calculus  do not say 

primary case  while  1  corresponds to the eo-called d i r e c t l y how they should be used  in procedures con constituent negation  in surface syntax  and in 
1 

corning inference . to t h i s aim  we introduced a new operator st x  read ae:   f o r x such that . . .   j . st is an operator w i t h a free number of arguments; in i t s nature  it is close to the epsilon operator but it is generalized f o r a greater   a r b i t r a r y   but f i n i t e   number of name arguments having a set character. we write st x  f x   g x  ＊ to be read   f o r such x for which f x  holds  g x  holds   which can be compared with russell s g x f x   ＊ and x stands for a sequence of set name variables  where no ambiguity can arise  we do not d i e t i n g uidh the name of an element from that of the set having only this one element . 
　　　the f i r s t step of t h i s t r a n s l a t i n g procedure  determined by rule t  depends on the fact whether the verb occurring in the given sr is or is not contertually bound. 
rule t: 
also in the f i r s t parenthesis following the symbols st or r; but no misunderstanding can arise here. 
　　　afterwards we eliminate  step by step  the occurrences of the symbol st  for a technical 
presentation of the whole procedure c f .   1   p.1-
 in such a way 
that it is replaced by one of the usual q u a n t i f i e r s  determined by the given d e l i m i t i n g feature  and  a f t e r other modifications stated in an algorithmic form  a formula of the second order predicate c a l culus is achieved  see the examples in the appen-
d i x   . 
if an sr contains the symbol neg  rule t is 
applied f i r s t disregarding neg; afterwards  
　　　 a  if neg has not been assigned the supers c r i p t b  then the symbol non  for l o g i c a l negation  is w r i t t e n to the l e f t of the t r a n s l a t i o n of the s t r i n g  in the formula representing the 
r e s u l t of the application of t to the given sr; 
　　　 b  if neg is present in the translated sr  before vb  then non v instead of v is w r i t t e n in the r e s u l t i n g formula.

indef cannot occur in  b    i.e. out of the scope of negation after auch a verb as  see   we work instead with spec.

see e.g.  1 pp .1f.  and  for the notion of preeuppos i t i o n ;  and  for the trichotomy of semantic units as discusaed below.

for a detailed discussion of the motivations that led to the specification of the scope of negation as summarized here  cf.    various operational tests can be used to check the scale of cd  the contextual boundness and the position of negation in an sr; the well-known question test  used in our investigations  has yield-
ed results similar to those reached by  l1  esp. 
chapter 1  ; cf. also  . the double indices ki stand for permutations of the numbers 1   . .   n   not necessarily ordered according to the systemic ordering  cf. what was said about topicalization in  s but this ordering necessarily appears inside the translated formula  cf. the substring r   x 1 . . .   x   in  1  and  1 . it is possible to introduce also a more subtle quantification of verbs  for repeated actions  non-immediate or gnomic events  e t c .     cf.  and

our examples are chosen in such a way that they might show how the proposed type of description permits to avoid the difficulties that have forced chomsky to  extend  his standard theory  and lakoff to introduce the  too strong  global constraints. - we do not specify the morphological gramnatemes  of tense  number  etc.  here  since they are not relevant for the present discussion. under  a  we give here the surface sentence {capital letters denoting the bearer of the intonational centre    b  being one of i t s sr s   c  the result of the application of t  and i t s extension for sr s containing the symbol neg    d  the reault s  of  individual steps of  further algorithm yielding finally a formula of the second order predicate calculus.
