 
     systems that simulates thinking processes of a man through natural language are called natural language systems. we present here outline of a 
     natural language system in connection with the system of concepts relations which plays important role in our system. the system of concepts r e l a t i o n s is a set of words or short sentences connected through various basic view-points-
     semantic analyses procedure using the system of concepts relations is shown by an example. we regard desire as basic cause of thinking in our system. outline of the r e l a t i o n between desire system and thinking processes using natural language as a base is given in l a t e r chapters. 
structure of the natural language system 
     natural language systems are the systems that simulate thinking processes of man   processes that perceive of our world   by describing them through natural language. we are l i v i n g with thinking or behaving a l l the time. we behave as a result of thinking and think as a result of behavi o r . what determines a man's thinking and behavior is the existence of desires. so to speak  desires are the basic cause of a l l behavior of man. thinking and behavior are means of s a t i s f y i n g desires  have no meanings to be s a t i s f i e d   and therefore what binds the r e l a t i o n between thinking and behavior i n t e r n a l l y are desires  and in order to s a t i s f y the desires thinking is necessary as the means for r e a l i z i n g them. our l i f e is s a t i s f a c t i o n or processes of s a t i s f y i n g of various desires each of us have in our mind  and as the means for s a t i s f y i n g these desires we inquire of thinking under the r e s t r i c t i o n s of environment. 
natural language system 
     the natural language system is consisted of  world   outside world    given in natural language and   t h i n k i n g system . the natural language system simulates thinking processes on the things about out1ide world using natural language as a part of raetij language   in other words  using natr a l language as a part of means for describing thinking processes  . the input to the system are given in natural language sentences   given from outside world or generated i n t e r n a l l y from the thinking system   and then the system thinks about these sentences  and outputs results in natr a l language sentences. in short   outside world  is a set of input sentences. 
structure of the thinking system 
     figure 1 shows structure of the thinking system. input sentences   from outside world   are infered   generate new sentences    judged   give 
modalities such as * t r u e '   ' f a l s e '   ' d o u b t f u l '   etc.   while making s y n t a c t i c   semantic and pragmatic analyses. in order to do such inferrence and judgement about input sentences  it is necessary to consult environment concerning input sentences simultaneously from outside w o r l d . environment including experiences from the pa1t to the present are also needed in the system  and these are stored in the system as  knowledge about the w o r l d   . in figure 1   knowledge about language  gives r e l a t i o n between language and i t s meanings   desire system  s t a r t s thinking and controls the o v e r a l l system. 

behavior of the thinking system 
     the thinking system in figure 1 behaves as follows. 
 a  analyze input sentences and give which are the intervals among words  which word consist  bunsetsu    the smallest element that can be a sentence  which is consisted by an independent word and annex words    what are the dependency r e l a tions among bunsetsu's in the input sentences. 
     these stages of analyses and the following stages of b c d are not independent to each other  therefore the system is only able to get possible analyses of sentences by following grammatical rules including tendencies   or s t a t i s t i c a l rules  in t h i s stage of analyses. 
 b  after guessing structures of input sentences  the system generates a set of normal form sentences which the system can process more easily than o r i g i n a l sentences by s i m p l i f y i n g   f o r m a l i z ing and unitorraalizing the sentences o n / i n which the system can handle. in s h o r t   a normal form sentence consists of a formal expression   sentences   which expresses predicate and case r e l a tions between the predicate and theob'-ects that o r i g i n a l sentence intended to express  and of the formal expression of the annex words and t h e i r meanings which intended to express modalities of the predicate. we also use normal form sentences for describing the system   to describe  environment

concrete nouns 
     concrete nouns are c l a s s i f i e d from the f o l l o w ing standpointg. 
     1  c l a s s i f i c a t i o n in order to give basic words. 
     basic words are those which are too vague if they are c l a s s i f i e d more roughly and are too f i n e that almost every word becomes compound word   l i k e l i s t - w a t c h   c o l o r - p e n c i l   . . .   i f they are c l s s i fled more f i n e r . basic words are words used in ordinary sentences. for example  a sentence ' animal bought product.' is too vague to know what kind of animals  what kind of products the animal bought. instead  'i bought t e l e v i s i o n . ' is a sentence which can be used as an ordinary sentence  though it does not say what kind of 1 or what kind of t e l e v i s i o n . 
     1  begining from basic words  obtain t h e i r kinds defined by basic view-points. at the same time we give words r e l a t i n g to basic words through basic view-points. see figure1. 
     here the problems are: 'are there basic viewpoints ' if there are view-points  how can we fined them out  chose a basic word w from a dictionary and select words i n t u i t i v e l y which are related to w. then t r y to find out through what view-points are they related to w. for example  l e t w='paper'. then chose words related to w 'manuscript p a p e r '   ' p u l p '   ' w r i t e '   ' w r a p '   . . . . 
¡¡¡¡between 'paper' and 'manuscript paper' we can find the view-point  purpose for use . namely  'manuscript paper' is a kind of 'paper' seeing through the view-point  purpose for use . 
     after extracting the view-point  purpose for use  we judge it whether it is acceptable as a basic view-point or not by examining it as follows. 
1 
     
     choose any word w' #w  and related words  then examine whether the view-point  purpose for use  is applicable between w' and related words. repeating this process several tiroes choosing d i f ferent w's  we know that the view-point  purpose use  can be a basic view-point. we can ob-
tain basic view-points for  concrete objects  by this way. 
system of concepts relations and semantic analysis 
to the verb 'drop'   from 1  to a   it is no problem if there exist for each word cause and effect relation like 'cup' as 1 . though we can not expect the existence of these  they may exist in the system of concepts relations as empirical  experienced  facts. it is expected that there exist cause and effect relation 1  in the system of concepts relations. 
     cause and effect relations 1  and 1  are probably in the system of concepts relations  especially 
1  .

     from this cause and effect r e l a t i o n and i t s conditions  to h o l d     it can be known that in order to break a concrete object it is necessary that it has physical property 'breakable'  or i t s thickness is ' t h i n ' . therefore  the system has to f i n d out that 'cup' is a kind of concrete obj e c t and it has physical property 'breakable*. 
     from above considerations  we know that the inferrence processes use following information. 
     1  we use ' k i n d '   ' m a t e r i a l '   ' p u r p o s e for u s e '   'physical p r o p e r t y ' . . . . as basic view-points  but basic view-points are used in order to make compos i t i o n of  generate  ' d e t a i l e d k i n d s ' . 
     1  cause and e f f e c t relations among verbs are used. 
     1  bes with respect to verbs are used. 
     a  from the conditions described with the cause and e f f e c t r e l a t i o n s and bes with respect to verbs are hold basic view-points are chosen to make inferrence. 
     1  substitution w i t h respect to the concepts related through the basic view-point ' k i n d ' is used. 
     1  functions that generates  fined out  concepts related to a given concepts through compositioned  generated  view-points are required. 
     here those factors which plays important role in making inferrence as desires are neglected. 
control of view-points in the system of concepts 
relations 
¡¡as mentioned above  the system is able to get meanings of concepts   i n other words  r e l a t i o n to other concepts with the concept  by following the concepts related through certain view-points in the system of concepts r e l a t i o n s . 	in t h i s case the system has to select view-points in succession. we c a l l the system which generates these viewpoint selection signal as 	'view-point c o n t r o l l e r ' . the structure of view-point c o n t r o l l e r is not clear and we expect to psychological engineering invest i g a t i o n s about 	the structure of view-point contr o l l e r . 	primary factors which select view-points  namely  primary factors which controls the viewpoint c o n t r o l l e r are as follows. 
     a  personal or general tendencies 	 acquired tendencies . 
     b  prijnary tendencies 	  l i k e i n s t i n c t s   . 
     c  restrictions of environment  including experiences  . 
     of these f a c t o r s   r e s t r i c t i o n s of environment are given f i r s t from the 'environment' in the thinking system  and then view-points selection 
w i l l be made following the factors of a and b. 

desire system as a basic cause of thinking 
relation between desires and language 
     desires give to the system basic cause of thinking 'what to think about'  and the system behaves to r e a l i z e the desire under r e s t r i c t i o n s of environment. we c a l l t h i s process t h i n k i n g . 
     desire r e a l i z i n g processes   t h i n k i n g processes  for a given desire are as f o l l o w s : 
     a  select verbs d i r e c t l y related to each de-s i r e . 
     b  get the bes with respect to the verb. there may be several bes for each verb. 
     c  generate normal form sentences for each bes. 
     d  store the normal form bes generated f o r each desire to the storage which has suitable s t o r i n g structures. 
     there may be many kind of models for s t o r i n g structures. pushdown stacking can be one of the models. conditions to erase the stored contents should be given to the system. for example  normal form sentences generated in r e l a t i o n to the desire 'appetite* may be erased a f t e r the desire i s s a t i s f i e d . 
desire system and stimulation 
     as mentioned above  each desire is watching input sentences from i t s own stand-point of whether the input normal form sentences can be s t i m u l a t i v e to the desire system . if it is judged that the input normal form sentence can give s t i m u l i to the desire system   then the system sends out a signal to the stimulator. when the stimulator receives the s i g n a l   it produces output  stimulation  having certain strength and it w i l l change states of the desire system. strength of the s t i m u l i is determined by the states of the desire system.

relation between desires and semantic  pragmatic processing 
     the procedures of semantic and pragmatic anal y s i s of input sentences  given in n a t u r a l language  given to the thinking system are as f o l l o w s : 
     a  generates normal form sentences from input sentences. 
     b  watching generated normal form sentences from the standpoint of each d e s i r e   the desire system determines whether they should produce s t i mulating signal to the desire system or not. 
     b1l  analyze the normal form sentences from the standpoint of each desire. 
example: 
     watch the input sentence ' r u n ' from the standpoint of 'desire for evasion'- get the following chain from the system of concepts r e l a t i o n s . run -  move -  t i r e d . .. evasion 
     b-1  such chains are stored in the system for each verb. therefore  the system is able to know for each desire  whether the given verb s a t i s f i e s the given desire or not  and hence the system is able to know whether the given verb should produce stimulating signal or not. in t h i s example 'run' produces stimulating signal to the desire for evasion. 

     d  then the stimulator works according to the input signals s 1   s 1 . . .   s and the states of s t r u c -

desire system  t r y to r e a l i z e  in this r e a l i z a t i o n process semantic analyses mentioned before are needed  though we do not go i n t o d e t a i l s of t h i s process in t h i s paper  the stated contents of the normal form sentences   i n d i c a t i n g 'what to do'  in the store getting information from the system of concepts r e l a t i o n s   under the r e s t r i c t i o n s of environment. while t h i n k i n g   new normal form sentences may be generated and stored in the system and at the same time some of the stored information may be erased according to the change of states of the desire system. in these thinking processes  generated information such as input normal form sentences  for each d e s i r e     sentences expressing environment etc. should be stored in the system and the r e l a t i o n to each stored normal form sentence   r e l a t i o n graph  have to be generated.
