 
　　　a family of supervised  nonparametric decision rules  based on tolerance regions  is described which includes the k-nearest neighbor decision rules when there are two classes. there are two practical reasons for doing so: f i r s t   a family of decision rules similar to the k-nearest neighbor rules can be specified which applies to a broader collection of pattern recognition problems. this is because  in the general class of rules  constraints are weakened between the number of training samples required in each training sample set and the respective a p r i o r i class probabilities; and a discrete loss function weighting the importance of the f i n i t e number of ways to make a decision error can be introduced. 
　　　second  within the family of decision rules based on tolerance regions  there are decision rules which have a property allowing for preprocessing of the training set data resulting in significant data reduction. 
theoretical performance for a special case is presented.
