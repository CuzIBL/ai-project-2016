　　　it is shown that the method of anal y t i c a l heuristics / 1 /   binarized formalism / 1 / and the model of a r t i f i c i a l conceptual intelligence / 1 / could be successfully used as a basis for describing 
the process of  arrivxng at decisions  based on the unified description of  beginning of conditions    body of conditions    beginning of responces .  body of responces    beginning or decisions    body of decisions  / 1 / by means of b i nary wave form of representing variables in tne vector-matrix form. the binary wave addressing we introduce tnat can be used for the  action space  as well  makes it possible to solve tne decision search problems without scanning d i f f i culties. the complete  wave binarization  of a l l the components for  behaviour during decision taking makes the s o l u t i on of direct and reverse problem feasibl e   that is compilation of special  system of equations for accomulation of experience  and  system of equations for decisions and conclusions . this method is formally presented as the one of decision table programming / 1 / . 
　　　it is shown that the vector-matrices of states we have introduced are  fuzzy   l.zadeh . the programs for multyfactor system estimation are created. it is illustrated by means of a well-known example of heuristical programming that theory avoids  scanning . matrix form of an ai heuristico-conceptual model is easily presented in the form of  block-diagrams and programs.
