¡¡¡¡¡¡this note o u t l i n e s research on n a t u r a l language communication between two p a r t i e s 
  
cooperating to accomplish a task. 	our goal is to formalize the knowledge needed to understand taskoriented dialogs and to develop techniques for representing and coordinating this knowledge in a computer system that can participate in the dialog. encoding general process knowledge and the dynamics of specific tasks in a manner that is useful for the interpretation and generation of utterances in a dialog is a central issue in this research. 
       a task orientation provides a framework for studying the influence of context on language. our previous analyses of several task-oriented dialogs 
 e.g.  deutsch  	1 	indicate 
        1  the context of an utterance includes at least three discernable factors: 	the preceding utterances in the dialog  the state of the task  and the physical environment of the dialog. 
        1  task-oriented dialogs have a s t r u c t u r e that r e f l e c t s the s t r u c t u r e of the task. 
       the set of objects and actions that are most relevant to the conversation  and hence in the focus of a t t e n t i o n of the d i a l o g p a r t i c i p a n t s   changes as the task progresses. to f o l l o w such s h i f t s in focus  a computational system needs a 
       model of the task being performed. 
       to meet t h i s need  we have developed a representation scheme for encoding process knowledge and are using it to encode data about s p e c i f i c tasks. 	this scheme is used both to answer p a r t i c u l a r questions about the task and to guide l i n g u i s t i c processing. 	the representation combines features of the p a r t i t i o n e d semantic networks of

       we are c u r r e n t l y developing algorithms that use t h i s representation of task knowledge to expand the use of context in the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of inputs and the generation of responses  i n s t r u c t i o n s   and requests. these algorithms include mechanisms that f o l l o w the s h i f t of focus w i t h the progress of the
