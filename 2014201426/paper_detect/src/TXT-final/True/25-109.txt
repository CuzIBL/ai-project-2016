in this talk  i treat the concept of  intelligence  as covering a broad domain that includes sensing and perceiving  thinking  and acting on the environment. in section 1  i argue that there are a number of general lessons offered by the scientific study of intelligent biological organisms for sensor-based robotic design. in section 1  i provide an example that focuses on the problem of human object perception and recognition. however  rather than follow the mainstream route by investigating vision  roberta klatzky and i have selected the  haptic  system for study. we formally define this as an information-processing system that uses inputs from receptors in skin  muscles  tendons and joints to perceive the concrete world and to guide actions within it. i present some of our experimental and empirically-based theoretical work on human haptic object processing  with particular emphasis on the nature and role of active manual exploration. in section 1  i suggest how this research programme may be modified and extended to guide the development of high-level manual exploration strategies for robots equipped with a haptic perceptual system. section 1 provides a more general summary of how knowledge of biological systems may contribute to the field of robotics. 
the parameters are determined by principles of physics. as the system is typically too complex to model without resorting to approximations  the parameter set is reduced arbitrarily by the investigator. the scientific method provides an alternate and complementary approach to the design of sensor-based robotic systems. all sciences are based on careful  systematic and repeatable observation. in addition  when we actually systematically control or manipulate the parameters under investigation  we are said to be using the  experimental method . the scientific study of any system provides a coherent framework within which to study a given problem  whether this pertains to living or artificial systems. it provides formal methods  experimental and statistical  with which to systematically and rigorously test the validity of one's hypotheses  based on empirical results. we see such issues as being critical as well to the successful development and implementation of intelligent sensorbased  tele robotic systems. the rigorous principles and methodologies of the experimental method expose some of the weaknesses and limitations of current robotic practice. we have argued that the scientific approach offers roboticists a powerful set of general tools with which to complement their formal analytic methods  see lederman & pawluk  1  for a mini-tutorial on the scientific method and its applications to robotics . 
¡¡let us turn now to one example involving the scientific study of intelligent biological systems  specifically the human haptic system  and how it processes and represents objects.

processing1 
1 	background 
several years ago  we  klatzky et al  1  demonstrated that humans are remarkably skilled at recognizing common objects  e.g.  hammer  using only touch. we asked blindfolded observers to identify a set of 1 common objects as quickly and as accurately as possible. subjects' accuracy approached 1%  while the majority of objects were identified within only 1 seconds. this was surprising at the time since others had suggested that the human sense of touch is incapable of such highlevel information processing  e.g.  walk & pick  1 . 
   we began to suspect that how people actively and manually explore such multidimensional objects might

play a critical role in uncovering  as well as eventually explaining  the substantial information-processing capacities we had demonstrated. in our next experiment  lederman & klatzky  1; expt. 1   we asked subjects to perform a haptic  match-to-sample  task; on each trial  subjects were initially presented with a  standard  object followed by a set of 1 serially presented multidimensional  comparison  objects. although all four objects in any set varied along many different object dimensions  e.g.  texture  shape  etc.  as underscored in figure 1   subjects were instructed to attend to a single dimension  such as texture. they were to select the comparison object that best matched the standard object on the dimension named. over the entire experiment  we used different unfamiliar custom-designed object sets for each of the dimension-matching instructions  some of which are shown  underscored  in figure 1.

1 areas of application 
it is possible to describe a continuum along which robotic systems can be placed. at one end  we would find those that clearly attempt to reproduce natural living systems. at the other end  we would find those that equally blindly reject the anthropomorphic approach. yet there is an alternate approach that roboticists may adopt for deriving potentially valuable information from the scientific study of biological systems. according to this approach  e.g.  lederman & pawluk  1; lederman et al  1   one gains new conceptualizations  scientific methodologies  and specific empirical results about how living systems deal with problems that roboticists have yet to solve. anatomical  biomechanical  neural  and behavioural constraints on information processing are all relevant areas of concern. 
¡¡the most likely applications of a biological approach are not to be found in highly structured environments  e.g.  industrial automation   which may be precisely controlled or modified - under such circumstances  there may be little benefit from copying human processing. it is rather in robotic environments over which the human has little or no control; examples would include those requiring underwater repair and recovery  service and maintenance of the space station  disposal of radioactive waste  exploration of unknown planets  and microrobotic surgery. for operation within such highly unstructured environments  roboticists may benefit from learning how biological systems accomplish complex sensory  cognitive and motor tasks in flexible  efficient ways. 
1 overlapping problem domains 
scientists who  study biological systems have addressed many of the same problems that roboticists now face. consider the following examples: sensor performance  sensor fusion  selection of primitives for scene segmentation and object recognition  object representations  active exploration vs. passive perception  motor control and planning for reaching  grasping and manipulating objects. both groups need to address 
     1 section 1 is based on material from lederman & pawluk  1 . 
hardware considerations to understand how such constraints affect the way information is processed and represented  and how this in turn affects system performance. 
1 living organisms are functioning  multi-level integrated systems 
it is important to recognize that biological organisms are complete  multi-level  integrated systems that actually work  despite the complexity of the many problems they must handle  see examples above . as such  living systems clearly demonstrate the complexity of the task facing the roboticist. both biological scientists and roboticists have found it simpler to treat the different sensory modalities as independently operating units; however  the most recent work with biological systems clearly demonstrates the ultimate fallacy and limits of this approach. 
1 designing 	human-machine 	interfaces 	for teleoperation 
initial predictions about the relatively rapid creation of highly flexible  sensor-based autonomous robots have proved overly optimistic. as a result  attention has turned to the design of teleoperated robots  which retain the human operator in the control loop. the rationale is that it is possible to short-circuit the design process by taking advantage of our own considerable sensory  cognitive and motor competencies. with an intact human central nervous system  it is no longer necessary to build an artificial one - as obvious by now  no mean feat! those of us who study human systems  however  are quick to point out that with this approach  it becomes critical for the roboticist to learn about how our own human sensory systems process information  and about the constraints under which these operate. such capabilities and limitations must be understood to achieve an effective interface with any teleoperated system. since we are unable to present all information from the remote workspace  what information should be presented to the human operator  and what are the most effective ways to display it  until now  such considerations have been ignored or noted too late for appropriate modification.

a system analytically using differential equations  where

performed for the texture-matching instructions; pressure  applied normal forces or torques about an object axis  was usually selected for hardness: static contact  simple static contact between an object surface and the skin  was associated with thermal matching; unsupported holding  lifting the object away from a supporting surface  usually in the form of dynamic hefting  was used for weight matching; enclosure  finger molding to the object envelope  was selected most often to extract both volumetric and global  coarse  shape; contour following  edge following  was used most in conjunction with both global shape and exact  fine  shape. 
1 	the macrostructure of human haptic object identification 
there are a number of computational models in the field of cognitive science that have successfully dealt with broad and complex domains of human information processing. our own general approach to haptic object processing can be appreciated first by analogy to the computational model of reading proposed by just and carpenter  1; 1  and outlined in figure 1.

¡¡in our own model  a period of manual exploration corresponds to a period of eye fixation. during the manual period  what we have called the  selectionextraction loop  takes place. an ep  or eps  is selected and performed at some area on the object  on the basis of activation flow. the resulting data are used to interpret a local object region  which in turn is used to build a global object representation for comparison with stored categorical representations. as much of the local and global processing is performed within an exploratory period as   possible; both recur during subsequent exploratory periods and object regions. eventually  the system recognizes an object or selects the next ep for execution.

¡¡figure 1 presents our model of the macrostructure of the haptic object-identification system  including the different data representations and the links we presume exist among them. an object component represents 
	lederman 	1 

particular objects  e.g.  wrench  and their specific property values. a property component represents the attributes along which an object may potentially vary  texture  hardness  etc.   rather than specific property values. more recently  we have divided properties into two major groups:  material  and  geometric . a material property is defined as having a factor affecting the response of a given material to imposed stimuli and constraints  independent of the shape and size of a given sample  for example  texture  rosenthal & asimow  1 . a geometric  sometimes called technological  property is one that relates to the geometry of a particular material sample  e.g.  shape  size .  hybrid  properties directly reflect both geometry and material  e.g.  mass . an ep component represents an exploratory procedure. the underlying neural mechanisms control ep execution and process property information arising from inputs to the sensory receptors. the latter sensorimotor component is not something we have modeled in our work; however  there is much relevant research that addresses both the neurophysiology and psychophysics of the somatosensory system. 
¡¡links between object and property components reflect the relative strengths of a given property for a particular object  e.g.  texture is important for sandpaper   while links between object components are primarily intended to reflect the hierarchical classification relations documented in the cognitive literature  e.g.  rosch  1 ; for example  wrenches and nuts are linked because of their common tool-related function. match-to-sample experiment tend to produce optimal performance in the constrained version of the experiment.

   links between ep and property components represent the precision of information about a property extracted by a particular ep. we have empirical data  lederman & klatzky  1; expt. 1  that address this issue. these were obtained from a variant of the match-to-sample experiment discussed above. on any trial  subjects were now constrained to perform a single designated ep in conjunction with a named property  with all possible ep/property combinations performed over the experiment. both accuracy and response times were measured. with these data  we were able to compare the relative precision with which each ep could extract a designated property. the results are shown in table la in the form of an ep-property weight matrix. the entries are based on relative accuracy and speed. a cell entry of  1  indicates that subjects could not perform the property-matching task above chance level with the ep shown. an entry of  1  indicated sufficient  but not optimal performance. a  1  indicated that performance with the given ep was optimal and sufficient  although it was not necessary. a  1  indicated that the given ep was necessary as well as optimal. note that  in general  those eps that were executed spontaneously in the initial 
invited speakers 
¡¡table lb provides us with additional important information. by summing the number of non-zero cells across a row in table la  we can represent the relative breadth of sufficiency of each ep; thus  lateral motion and pressure each provide sufficient information about several different properties  whereas enclosure and contour following provide coarse information about most object properties considered in this study. however  the breadth of property information provided by contour following must be weighed against its relatively slow execution time  also shown in table lb. 
¡¡links between ep components represent the extent to which the eps may be co-executed  each extracting the property ies  for which an ep is optimal/sufficient. for example  lateral motion and pressure may be executed simultaneously  thus providing information about texture and hardness. we have developed a set of visible kinematic and dynamic parameters that formally differentiate the eps; these parameters were derived from an extensive body of hand-movement data  based on a large number of common and custom-designed multidimensional objects tested over a wide range of experimental conditions. values of four parameters were observed to occur reliably for a given ep across the different circumstances just described. each parameter may be described as capturing some constraint inherent in an ep when it must be performed to extract certain types of information. the parameters and their stereotypic values are shown in table 1a: these are movement  static or dynamic   direction  force applied normal or tangential to the surface   region  of the object contacted by the end effector  i.e.  surface  edge  or both   and workspace constraint  supporting surface required or not . it is assumed that compatibility between a pair of eps only exists to the extent that the constraints inherent in their parameter values can be satisfied simultaneously through some manner of exploration. the information in table 1a allows us to determine whether any two eps are compatible or not. clearly  two eps having identical parameter values would be compatible; however  they could not be differentiated. still  it is possible to achieve compatibility by selecting some form of exploration that satisfies the constraints inherent in both eps. for example  if one ep must be executed along the edges  whereas another must be applied to both edges and interior surfaces  in satisfying the second less restrictive constraint the first more restrictive constraint is simultaneously satisfied. hence  the two eps can be considered to be compatible.

1 	selecting an ep and the selection-extraction loop 
in keeping with the interactive activation perspective 
 e.g.  mcclelland & rumelhart  1   we treat haptic object identification as a parallel interactive process  with sequential constraints imposed by ep execution. figure 1 shows how the process proceeds in a sequence of selection-extraction loops. during each step  an ep is selected and executed  along with any other compatible eps . in this way  information about associated properties is extracted; the precision of the information is determined by the weights on the links between eps and properties. over a sequence of these loops  an object representation is built up and used as a probe to match against stored object representations. when a match criterion is satisfied  the search process is terminated  the object is said to be recognized. 

figure 1. the selection-extraction loop  from klatzky & lcdcrman  1 and in press . 
1.1 constraints on ep selection 
¡¡the primary goal during the selection-extraction loop is to choose an ep for execution  under a number of competing constraints  for example  the need to know as much about the object as quickly as possible or the need to learn about a desired object property. there may also be inherent biases that govern the use of certain eps; for example  contour following is relatively time consuming and  for humans  also fails to provide sufficiently precise 
	lederman 	1 
contour information to effect fine shape discrimination. this may generally discourage the use of contour following. in contrast  enclosure might be generally favoured inasmuch as it is relatively fast and provides coarse information about many different properties  broad ep sufficiency . 
¡¡in principle  these constraints and biases can be represented by the weights between different components in our system. for example  associations between specific objects can be represented by associative weightings within the object component  while expectations concerning the diagnostic value of various properties can be represented by connections between the property and object components. hand movement precision and breadth of sufficiency are represented by connections between property and ep components  table lb ; ep compatibility  table 1b  is determined by constraints inherent in the ep parameters  table 1a . finally  intrinsic biases  such as duration of execution  may be represented as item-specific bias terms. 
in this first output table  the complete weight matrix of 
table la was used  thus including positive weights on all 
eps that were at least sufficient for extracting a given property. this might represent a condition in which the observer wishes to extract as much information as possible initially. note that no matter which ep is clamped  the maximum activation level always occurs for an enclosure  which is not only broadly sufficient but also compatible with other eps. the next most active element is unsupported holding  which is compatible with enclosure. thus  this pair of eps could be selected and executed within the same loop.

1.1 a constraint satisfaction approach 
¡¡collectively  these constraints function to select an ep  given a specific object and certain prior expectations. in connectionist terms  the ep selection process can be treated as a constraint satisfaction algorithm  in which the weights serve as constraints to be progressively relaxed until some elements are maximally activated. 
¡¡a system with symmetric weights and asynchronous updating minimizes a cost function over the set of constraints  weights   eventually selecting an optimum state or activation pattern over the associated units  hopfield  1 . in our case  constraint satisfaction serves as a method for selecting the next ep in a sequence during manual exploration. the weights are theoretically and/or empirically derived associations among eps and properties  and potentially  objects . as the system progressively relaxes  a stable activation pattern eventually emerges that is used to predict which ep will be executed next in some exploratory situation. 
¡¡to consider the consequences of the associations between eps and properties and the compatibilities between eps  we implemented the weights in tables la and 1b as a constraint satisfaction system. the nodes represented the eps and properties. this is equivalent to examining a single generic object. 
¡¡table 1a shows the activation level of each ep  as well as the time to relax and goodness level at the point of relaxation  after constraint satisfaction. each property was clamped to represent an externally set property goal.

¡¡table 1b models a different situation  which might occur following the initial stage of coarse exploration -- if more precise information is required than can be extracted by an ep that is merely sufficient for that property  the optimal ep would be required. to model this we used a second set of weights in which only optimal ep-property weights in the matrix were included. note the very different activation levels - here we see that clamping a particular property results in the optimal ep being selected. 
1 	behavioural support for a constraint satisfaction approach 
1.1 human experiments on the 1-stage ep sequence 
¡¡the results of our modeling are supported by evidence of a 1-stage exploratory sequence  which was adopted by subjects during an object classification task  lederman & klatzky  1b . on each trial  subjects were initially asked a yes/no question of the type:  is this x further a y    e.g.   is this wood-working implement further a piece of sandpaper   . an object was then placed in the subjects hands for exploration; on half the trials  the object was in fact an exemplar of both x and y classes named in the question  while on the remaining trials  an object from the same x but different y class was presented  e.g. file . the most diagnostic property for each object class named in the questions had been determined previously in a separate experiment  lederman & klatzky  1b . 

position of ep in sequence 
figure 1. cumulative percentage of occurrence of each ep as a function of position in the exploratory sequence  from lederman & klatzky  1b . the solid lines indicate the grasp/lift combination. static contact is not included because it occurred very infrequently. 
¡¡¡¡the hand movements from each trial were analyzed as a sequence of eps. this analysis indicated two separate stages of manual exploration  as evident in figure 1. each function depicts the cumulative percentage of ep occurrence as a function of serial position in the ep sequence. the two solid dark lines indicate that the first two eps in the sequence were an enclosure followed by an unsupported holding  which together comprise what we refer to as a grasp/lift routine. both of these are relatively broadly sufficient and would presumably provide considerable coarse information about any object. the remaining ep functions occurred after this initial exploratory sequence  the particular ep being predicted by the property that was known to be most important for object identification. for example  since texture was most diagnostic for deciding whether or not the wood-working tool in the subject's hands was a piece of sandpaper  we predicted that lateral motion would be selected following execution of a grasp/lift routine  since it is optimal for extracting texture. such predictions were confirmed. the second stage of exploration was more specifically directed toward extracting further precise information about the critical property. in short  these data on manual exploration during object identification support our approach to exploratory control as a constraint satisfaction process. 
1.1 experiments on the selection-extraction loop and property extraction 
¡¡in addition to determining how eps are selected  our model also addresses how ep selection affects the precision with which information about an object can be extracted. we assume that the strength of relations between eps and properties  table la  should predict the extent to which an object's properties may be perceived and learned using a particular form of manual exploration. this assumption has several implications. learning about a property should be fastest when exploration involves an optimal ep  because less sampling is necessary to obtain a given amount of information. when only a single optimal ep is executed  incidental information about other properties will be restricted to those for which that ep is sufficient. selecting compatible eps allows for co-execution  thus making available information about all properties for which either is sufficient. presumably  selecting one ep is assumed to prevent the co-occurrence of any other incompatible eps also selected; rather  these must be performed in sequence. if the eliminated eps are necessary for a given property  then no learning about that property will occur. clearly  these predictions highlight the  gatekeeper  role that eps play during object perception. 
¡¡we have investigated the role of eps in limiting accessibility to object properties in a series of experiments  klatzky et al.  1; reed et al  1; lederman et al  in press . the tasks generally required subjects to learn to classify sets of multidimensional objects into groups according to different classification rules. for these tasks  we designed sets of objects that varied factorially in a number of properties  such as texture  hardness  shape and size. at least one of these properties was used to divide objects into categories. 
	lederman 	1 

take an example of a 1-property rule:  the roughest objects were all in category  a   the intermediate roughness objects all in category  b   and the smoothest all in category  c . over a set of trials  subjects were required to indicate to which category the objects in a set belonged. response time for object classification was measured as time from contact to verbal response. 
¡¡across one experiment  the categorization tasks demanded that subjects extract information about one or more diagnostic properties of each presented object. we expected response time to decrease as the sets were repeatedly presented  because subjects would learn to eliminate those eps that were not optimal for learning about the diagnostic property. and indeed  we note in figure 1 that response time decreased to an asymptotic value for three different sets of objects regardless of the number of diagnostic object properties used to classify objects in a given set  1  1  or 1 . 

figure 1. mean response time for classifying each object based on 1  1-redundant  and 1-redundant property classification rules  adapted from klatzky et al  1 . the 1- and 1-redundant functions were both produced by averaging data from several different property-classification conditions. 
¡¡one important reason for the reduction in response time becomes evident when we examine the corresponding eps performed over successive time periods in the 1-property case  figure 1 . we observe that subjects chose to streamline their manual exploratory activity over time. thus  eps that were optimal for extracting the diagnostic property  texture  shape  or hardness  continued to occur frequently and across blocks; in contrast  the other eps scored in the study occurred less often initially and subsequently declined. similar results were obtained for the 1- and 1property categorization conditions discussed next.

pressure  contour following  and enclosure  over sequential periods for three different 1-property classification conditions 
 adapted from klatzky et al. 1 . lm= lateral motion; pr= pressure; en= enclosure; cf=contour following. 
   we also predicted that when more than one property redundantly defines the categories  e.g.  all  a s are both very rough and very hard  all  b s are of intermediate roughness and intermediate hardness  and all  c s are both very smooth and very soft   categorization times should be faster than with a 1-property classification rule. this is evident in figure 1 by the fact that the 1and 1-property curves lie below the 1-property curve  indicating a  redundancy gain . we argue that this reflects the savings resulting from the fact that the eps that were optimal for extracting two properties were compatible  e.g.  lateral motion and pressure for redundant texture and hardness . that there is no additional savings from adding a third redundant dimension  shape  to redundant texture and hardness specifically reflects incompatibility of contour following with either lateral motion or pressure. 
¡¡we further predicted that when a single ep is used to explore an object  incidental knowledge about other properties will accrue depending on the weight between each property and that ep. to assess this  we turn now to another experimental approach  which involves what we have called the  withdrawal  paradigm. we presented subjects with sets of objects that were redundantly defined with different 1-redundant property classification rules  texture/hardness; texture/shape; hardness/shape . subjects were initially told to classify the objects on the basis of a single named dimension  e.g.  texture   even 

though objects varied redundantly on two dimensions  texture and hardness ; when performance asymptoted  the object set was switched to a one-dimensional rule  i.e.  objects only varied in texture  since values of the second property  hardness  were now held constant. that is  variation on the second property was  withdrawn . we reasoned that if subjects had previously incidentally learned about the second property  then their response times should increase just after it was withdrawn. figure 1 presents the results. note a strong withdrawal effect for texture/hardness redundancies  regardless of which dimension was withdrawn. in contrast  withdrawal effects for the other two combinations were very small  and typically not statistically significant. this result was also expected as contour following  for shape  is incompatible with both 
lateral motion  texture  and pressure  hardness  for the set of planar stimulus objects used: shape information was only available at the edges  while texture and hardness were both found in the interior surface areas. in contrast  when texture and shape are available in the same local region  created by using fully 1-dimensional ellipsoids of revolution   we obtained strong withdrawal effects. we predicted this outcome because information about both shape and texture was simultaneously available from the now fully compatible eps  contour following and lateral motion.

1 application to robotic exploration 1 
in keeping with gibson's earlier observations  e.g. 1   much research with humans and other living organisms has highlighted the importance of active exploration in perceptual activities. our own work again confirms this general principle with respect to human haptic object processing. in the robotic domain  bajcsy  1  may be credited with emphasizing the need for exploration  particularly when information about object properties must be used to interact with unstructured environments. presumably  such is true whether or not identification is requisite. 
¡¡bajcsy and a number of others have recently linked the biological and robotic exploration domains by specifically adoping the concept of an ep as a systematic testing procedure  and by implementing robotic versions of the human eps described above  e.g.  allen & michelman  1; bajcsy & campos  1; sinha  1; stansfield  1 . however  neither the selection of particular eps nor the sequence in which these should be performed is intuitively obvious. we advocate adopting the experimental paradigm used by lederman & klatzky  1  expt. 1; see section 1 of this paper  to develop a more general robotic search solution for ep selection when multidimensionally varying objects are explored. this experimental approach allows the systematic determination of the relative performance characteristics of the set of robotic eps selected  which could then be used in conjunction with a constraint satisfaction approach to select efficient ep sequences. 

   in the previous set of experiments  a particular property was targeted. another series of experiments focused on ep selection under conditions in which no 1 section 1 is based on material from lederman et al  1 .

   consider the following scenario. we begin with the view of an ep as a motoric routine that is optimal for extracting one property  although it may also be sufficient for extracting several others. the properties and associated eps will depend upon the particular robotic end effector and sensing system selected  and could be quite different from what humans use  unless an anthropomorphic design has been deliberately adopted . having selected a set of properties and eps  one can now experimentally test the relative constraints on ep performance  however this is defined by the roboticist. the constraints on human eps listed in table la may be applied to any exploring system  along with any others that are specifically relevant to the robotic domain. the experiment described in section 1 can be used as a methodological guide for systematically evaluating the relative performance of each ep in extracting each property; note that the tasks should involve different levels of property discrimination if ep performance is to be fully and properly assessed. also relevant to this approach is the extent to which robotic eps may be co-executed  that is  the issue of ep compatibility. to determine the compatibilities and incompatibilities between eps  the ep descriptions must be specifically defined in terms of robotically relevant constraint parameters. collectively  the results concerning the relative strengths of the ep-to-property and inter-ep-compatibility associations can be used to rank robotic eps for use in associated computational models of ep selection. 
1 summary 
 in closing  i would like to repeat my claim that the scientific study of biological organisms can further the development of current sensor-based robots in many different ways  without being constrained by  or limited to  anthropomorphic design. on a general level  i have argued  lederman & pawluk  1; lederman et al  1  that such work: a  addresses many of the same problem domains  b  provides an example of  and framework for  designing working  multilevel integrated systems  and c  offers valuable suggestions for presenting robotically extracted information to a human operator in teleoperation. further  d  the scientific method highlights the value of properly constraining the problem  formulating testable hypotheses  designing rigorous and unbiased experimental tests of the hypotheses  and using statistical techniques for assessing the validity  reliability and generality of the experimental findings. on a more specific level  based on our familiarity with the scientific results of experiments on biological touch  my colleagues and i have further proposed a number of particular suggestions for designing robotic tactile/haptic systems  including the

example discussed in section 1. for biological scientists  who attempt to understand the bases of natural intelligence  and roboticists  who attempt to create such behaviour in machines  serious collaboration may provide a new and potentially valuable approach to robotic design.
