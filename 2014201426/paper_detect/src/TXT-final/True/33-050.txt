 
　　one of tha principal goals of tha taxman project is to develop a theory about the structure and dynamics of legal concapts  using corporate tax law as an experimental problem domain in this paper we describe the  prototype* plus-deformation  model of legal conceptual structure a concept is represented here by a prototypical description plus a sequence of deformations of the prototype  where the deformations are selected from among the possible  mappmga  of one concrete description into another the paper focuses on the set of mappings  which is the most important component of the model because it makes manifest the basic coherence of the conceptual space the syntax and semantics of the mappings are described  and their role in the process of legal argument is suggested the formal modal is then illustrated by examples drawn from eisner v macomber  an early stock dividend case 
i introduction 
　　in an earlier paper on the taxman project   l     we outlined our basic representation of the corporate tax domain   using a frame-baaed language  with extended facilities for the description of states  events  actions and expectations  a principal feature of this representation is its abstraction/expansion hierarchy a relatively abstract  conceptual structure is given an  expanded  representation in terms of an assemblage of mora concrete conceptual structures  and a recursive pattern-matching procedure is used to  generate  the expansions when given the abstractions  and to  recognize  the abstractions when given the expansions we have referred to this model of a conceptual hierarchy as a 
　　logical template model  and we have demonstrated that it is adequate for representing tha facts of an actual corporate tax case  such at united states v. phettis  1 us 1  1   and adequate also for representing the statutory rules and concepts which classify such cases aa tax-free reorganizations under sections 1 a  1  b .  c  and  d  of the internal revenue code    l    m addition  we have concluded that tha model is adequate for certain practical applications in tha legal field  as long as tha domain of application ia carefully chosen  
　　lawyers would object  however  that the logical template modal is theoretically inadequate as a representation of a ayatam of legal concepts. first  a lawyer might say  tha moat important lagai concepts era  open-textured   see   pp. 1  their etructure is never logical and precise  but amorphous and poorly defined second  legal concepts are not static structures  but dynamic ones  see  : they are typically constructed and reconstructed as they era applied to a particular set of facts. in this paper we will describe a representation of a system of legal concepts which attempts to capture some of these characteristics. in place of the logical template model  we will represent an abstract concept by a prototype and a sequence of deformations of the prototype the prototype is a relatively concrete description selected from the lower-level factual network itself  and the deformations are selected from among the possible mappings of one concrete description into another we have suggested in our earlier papers that these  prototypeplus-deformation  structures play a crucial role in the proceas of legal argument  and that they contribute a degree of stability and flexibility to an emerging system of concapts that would not exist with the logical template structures alone   
　　the idea of representing an abstract concept by a 
　　prototype and a sequence of deformations of the prototype has numerous antecedents in the literature in the philosophical literature  the idea is suggested in the  family resemblances' of wittgenstein   the  paradigms' of kuhn    and the recent work by several authors on the logic of  natural kinds' . in cognitive psychology  the idea has emerged recently in the experimental work of rosch and others   on the coding of natural categories there nave been several attempts to formalize these notions in the artificial intelligence literature: for example  the suggestion by minsk y  that a collection of  frames'* could be connected by pairwiae  difference descriptions' into a similarity network'; or the work of winston on tha construction of  transfer frames   and the understanding of analogies  however  since the notion of a  prototype  has generated a great deal of controversy and confusion in the recent literature  sea  eg    it would appear that the prototype-plua-deformation model  taken as a whole  is not yat fully understood 
　　in this paper we will focus our attention on the mappings in the apace of descriptions  since this is the element of the prototype-plus-deformation modal which gives the conceptual representation its coherence. in section ii. wa will outline the basic formalism and introduce two important devices the map  which enpreeeea a relationship between two concrete descriptions; and the 

1 

xdn  which defines a general transformation on the space of concrete descriptions. in section iii  we will illustrate these formalisms with some examples drawn from an early corporate tax case  and we will suggest the ways in which the maps and the xdns play a role in the process of legal argument. 
ii the model: a structured space of descriptions 
　　we have described the basic representational mechanisms of the taxman ii system in our previous papers   l     but it may be helpful to review the essential points here. to set up a domain of discourse in taxman ii  see generally k we first construct a system of templates to describe the classes of objects in the domain  and a system of relations to express the possible relationships between these objects to describe the facts of a particular case  we generate instances of the templates and their associated relations in a particular context the main work of the taxman ii system is then performed by a collection of pattern-matching procedures which operate on descriptions  or  as they are frequently called  ddns a ddn has three components: a template list a constraint-list and a bindings-mat  where 

for example  the following ddn would represent the ownership of more than 1 percent of the common stock of a corporation  with the corporation in question bound either to  dupont  or to  standardoil : 

in this example  we have assumed that the domain already contains a definition of the template own  with relations owner  and  owned ; the template share  with relations  quantity  and  shareof ; and the template stock  with the relations as indicated. 
　　now suppose we wished to use the preceding ddn. but minus the bindings for the corporation ci  as a representation of the expansion of the concept of corporate control   as defined in section 1 c  of the internal revenue code. we would do this by defining a 
　　new template called control  with relations  controller  and  controlled : 

and then linking up the  1percentownership  description with the following adst recti on 

in other words   a1 controls c1  if  a1 owns more than 
1 percent of the common stock of c1 the example is a simple one  but for a discussion of several more complicated forms of the abstraction/expansion hierarchy  and an analysis of the procedures rmatch and gmake which operate upon them  see  and . as an indication of the level of complexity that we can presently handle  consider the following definition of a  breorganization  in section 1 a  1  b  of the internal 
revenue code the acquisition by one corporation  in exchange solely for all or a part of its voting stock  or in exchange solely for all or a part of the voting stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation   of stock of another corporation if  immediately after the acquisition  the acquiring corporation has control of such other corporation  whether or not such acquiring corporation had control immediately before the acquisition  
this example  and others like it  are discussed in detail in 
 
	even 	with 	a 	substantial 	elaboration 	of 	the 
1 
abstraction/expansion pairs  of course  the preceding formalism captures only the 'logical template  version of a conceptual hierarchy to generalize this representation to a system of  prototypes' and deformations   we will replace the single ddn expression in the abstraction/expansion hierarchy with a structured space of don expressions the expansion will thus have three components  1.  an  invariant  component  consisting of a single don. to handle the case of a concept like control  which can be represented with a simple logical template expansion   1  a set of exemplars   each of which is a ddn. to handle the case of 
a concept which cannot be represented with a simple logical template expansion. and  1  a set of transformations'  eech of which is a map. to tie the set 
of exemplars together into a coherent whole. the set of exemplars by itself provides only a disjunctive specification of a conceptual expansion  without giving any indication of how the various exemplars are related to one another  but the set of transformations is intended to supplement this disjunctive specification by expressing certain relationships among the exemplary  and thus imposing an order and a structure on the conceptual space in this way we hope to capture one of the more important characteristics of the prototype-plus-deformation model: the fact that we can designate one or more of the exemplars as the prototype  
and then arrange the remaining exemplars in the order of their prototypicality 
　　obviously  the critical component of this definition is the map structure  which was discussed informally in  as a first approximation  s map has the following form 
	 map 	 neme  
 etmeture1  ::= ddn  structure1  ::* don invariant  ::  ddn 
 transformatlon  ::= map  
and it expresses the fact that the ddn in the etrueturel slot can be mapped into the ddn in the structure1 slot  with a specified ddn as the invariant and a specified map as the residual transformation for simplicity  we will assume that the map operates only on the template-ilet component of the ddn  leaving the constraint-ilet and the bindings -list unchanged with this simplification  then  we could write out a sample mapping as follows 

　　notice  however  that the map formalism  as described so far  adds nothing of substance to the domain: it merely restates the relationships that exist implicitly by virtue of the structure of the ddn space and the definition of the pattern-matcher we often refer to the relationship between the invariant slot and the two structure slots here a$ an implicit vertical mapping  since it corresponds to the vertical' generalization-specialization hierarchy in the space of ddn expressions  compare here the  version spaces  of mitchell  1l   analogously  we often refer to the relationship in the transformation slot as an implicit horizontal mapping in the preceding example  the horizontal mapping from share to cash reveals no structure of any importance  but there are numerous mappings in the corporate tax domain which depend on a continuous parameter  eg. the quantity of stock outstanding the proportionality of s stockholders ownership interest  the risk or the liquidity of ar  investment   and these other horizontal mappings impose a partial order on the ddn space which is orthogonal to the partial order of the generalization/specialization hierarchy it turns out that the implicit mappings of the ddn space can all be defined in terms of a small set of primitive syntactic operations - operations which add and delete templates and relations; operations which move up and down the ako hierarchies  operations which mark variables as identical or distinct; etc - and these operations can be arranged in a preference ordering which preserves several important aspects of the simplicity and the compactness of the ddn expressions for details  see  
1 　　however  these implicit maps are not enough in order to construct a useful system of prototypes and deformations  it is necessary to have available a set of explicit mappings of the don space  i.e. a set of mappings between ddn structures which are not mappabie by virtue of their syntactic structure alone what does this mean  aa a first approximation  we could simply stipulate that a certain map  such as the  share cash  mapping illustrated above  had been previously defined in our domain and was therefore available whenever it turned out to be useful but we can often say more than this frequently  we can explain a mapping between two dissimilar don structures by pointing to a related mapping with a known invariant and a known transformation in a different dimension  of the ddn space for example  we might be able to describe the relationship between two events by describing the relationship between the two corresponding sequences of state descriptions or we might be able to describe the relationship between a  share' and a  cash by describing the relationship between the rights and the obligations associated with each sometimes these new mappings will be used to construct invariant relationships in the ddn space  m which case we will call them explicit vertical mappings  and sometimes they will be used to construct ordered transformations in the ddn space  in which case we will call them explicit horizontal mappings  by analogy to the implicit mappings discussed previously. the important point  though  is that these new mappings are not just syntactic mappings instead they impose an explicit semantic structure on the space of ddn expressions. 
　　to carry out these constructions  it is clear that we need a general facility for defining new maps in terms of old ones  and with the appropriate expressive power. these considerations lead us to the following definitional form: 

as suggested  the xdn is s defined transformation which takes two arguments  argl and erg1  and expresses the mapping between them in terms of the complex of related transformations listed in its body because the arguments are usually complex ddn expressions  the scope specification is provided to decompose them into their component parts; the given ddn-patterns are matched to the arguments  first to determine the potential applicability of the transformation itself  but also to bind the internal variables of the xdn to the components of the ddn expressions  in whatever detail is needed the body of the xdn can then take several forms there would be certain elementery transformations to provide the building blocks for the entire system: for example  one important elementary transformation would represent the implicit syntactic mapping described earlier  in which the inverient is a matching ddn expression and the transformation is a residual map  another set of elementary transformations would represent the arithmetical relationships in the domain. and so on the compound transformations would then be written as the result of applying an xdn to the components of argl and arg1 in this case  structure! and struoture1 refer to the sub-structures of the ddnpatterns  as extracted by means of the scope specification a number of variations of xdn apply are possible  but the most important variant for our present purposes is the transformation defined in a related  dimension  of the ddn space we represent this transformation by filling in the structure slots with an expression of the form 

which  by assumption  produces the projection of the arguments in the specified ddn space in this case  the xdn expresses the following fact argl and erg1 can be mapped together because the projections of argl and erg1 in the specified ddn space can be mapped together under the application of a known xdn. 
　　we will provide illustrations of these constructions in the following section of this paper. at the same time  we will suggest how the xdn formalism and the map formalism play a role in the construction and modification of legal concepts. since the xdn is basically a lambdaexpression  and since the map expresses the result of applying an xdn to a particular pair of ddn expressions  we can explain some of the procedures for conceptual construction in the prototype-plus-deformation model in terms of a directed interaction between lambda-abstraction and lambda-application. we will not develop this point in the present paper  but there will be hints of it in the discussion of the corporate tax case which follows 
iii illustrations: the mappings of 
eisner v. macomber 
　　we will draw our illustrations from eisner v macomber. 1 us 1  1   one of the landmark decisions of the early corporate tax code the case involved the distribution of a 1 percent stock dividend myrtle h macomber  who originally owned 1 shares of the common stock of standard oil  received a dividend consisting of 1 additional shares of the same stock. and the collector of internal revenue  as required by the revenue act of 1. imposed a tax on the distribution 
the supreme court  however  in an opinion by justice 
pitney  held that a stock dividend of this sort was not income  within the meaning of the sixteenth amendment to the constitution  and thus the tax could not constitutionally be imposed justice brandeis  in an elaborate opinion  dissented several other cases were discussed as precedents in the course of the argument the distribution of a corporations cash  as in lynch v hornby  1 us. 1  1   and the distribution of the stock of an unrelated corporation  as in peabody v. eisner  1 us. 1  1   were situations that all parties agreed should be taxable on the other hand  the appreciation in the value of a stock without the actual transfer of stock certificates  a purely hypothetical case  was a situation that all parties agreed should be nontaxable the task for justice pitney and justice brandeis. then  as outlined in   was to construct a concept of taxable income consistent with these agreed precedents  and in such a way that the macomber case itself would be classified as nontaxable 
 pitney  or taxable  brandeis  
　　we have discussed the details of the macomber arguments in an earlier paper . and we will not repeat them here. however  an important step in the analysis  for both parties  was the construction of a sequence of mappings between the decided and the undecided cases  and these mappings provide an interesting illustration of the formalisms set forth in the previous section of this paper for example  one of the more important points in justice 
1 pitney s argument was the construction of a mapping between the macomber case and the unrealized appreciation case: the taxpayer in macomber now owns 1 shares of common stock out of 1 1 outstanding  the argument goes  but that's the same as owning 1 shares out of 1 1 outstanding  which is the situation that would have existed had there been no actual transfer of stock certificates as justice pitney puts it in his opinion  1 us 1. 1  1 . the stock dividend  does not alter the pre-existing proportionate interest of any stockholder  the point is a simple one. but how would we formalize it  
　　first let us assume that there exists the following xdm in our domain: 

which expresses the fact that an ordered pair of state descriptions can be mapped into an indefinite sequence of state descriptions if the initial state descriptions. vera and varx  can be mapped together by some known mapping xdnt and the final state descriptions  varfi and vary. can be mapped together by some known mapping xdn1 
although this mapping might not be considered an invariant mapping in all contexts  in the corporate tax domain there ara strong reasons for treating it as such two sequences of transactions which reach the same and result ought not to be treated differently just because one of them follows a different path let us therefore attempt to apply the  endstatemepping  to our problem  binding a description of the unrealized appreciation case to dl and a description of the macomber case to dz because of the definition of the unrealized appreciation case  the pattern-match inside the first scope specification will bind the identical state description to vara and varb: 1 shares out of 1 1 however  the pattern-match of the macomber case  expanded backwards in time to a point just before the issuance of the new stock  will bind this same state description to varx. and s different state description to very: 1 shares out of 1.1 it follows  then. that the  endstetemapping  can be fully applied if xdnl is the identity transformation  and if xdn1 is a transformation of the following sort 


now it is conceivable that the xonstantstockratio  mapping has already been defined in our domain  since it is an invariant transformation of broad applicability  and if this is the case then our analysis is done 
　　however  the force of this mapping can be strengthened substantially if we project it onto s more detailed representation of the space of security interests the ownership of common stock carries with it certain rights to the  earnings   the assets  and the  control  of a corporation  and these rights can be represented by s system of permission and obligation schemata  1 for simplicity  let us focus our attention on the right to earnings: we represent this with a pair of descriptions expressing the fact that when s certain situation is satisfied the corporation is permitted to carry out the action of distributing earnings prorata to the common stockholders suppose we now ask what earnings would be distributed to the owners of the shares in the structural and the structure1 slots of the xonstantstockratio mapping above it is not too difficult to construct a procedure which gives us the answer we trace along the path from the permission structure  to the embedded distribution  and then to the expansion of the distribution in terms of a sequence of transfers to each stockholder the result simplified 
slightly  is 

which gives us the  projection' of the original' description onto the space of  permitted transfers of earnings'. but notice now that this pro/ection is identical for both the struoturel and the structure1 slots of the 
xonstantstockratio  mapping  and thus the mapping has been shown to preserve an invariant in the security interest apace. furthermore  the invariant works only for common stock  not for preferred stock  since the 

1 

distribution to preferred stockholders is normally stated in terms of the number of shares owned  instead of the fraction of ownership. having discovered this invariant mapping  of course  we can now use it to construct an explicit invariant xdn in our domain  following the notation in the previous section of this paper. 
　　a more difficult mapping to represent is the one constructed by justice brandeis to demonstrate that it is impossible to draw a coherent line of distinction between the stock distribution of eisner v. macomber and the cash distribution of lynch v. hornby. in his argument justice brandeis posits a sequence of hypothetical cases first the distribution of common stock  then preferred stock  then bonds; then the distribution of long-term notes  then shortterm notes; and finally the distribution of cash. this is basically an elaboration of the  share cash  mapping introduced in the previous section of this paper  but for the mapping to have any force it must be projected onto a detailed representation of the security interest space. for simplicity  let us concentrate on a portion of the mapping: from common stock  to preferred stock  to bonds a direct projection of these securities onto the space of permissions and obligations  which worked well in our previous example  fails to give us the result we want in this case  since the permission and obligation structures are not directly mappable. the common stockholders receive a permitted distribution of residual earnings  but conditional on a prior permitted distribution to the preferred stockholders  while the bondholders receive an obligatory distribution of a fixed amount  and there appears to be no way to compare these various structures except by listing all of their pairwise differences. however  a further projection  onto a space of expectations  reveals both a common pattern and a systematic difference 
　　to see this  let us analyze how the corporation is expected to behave  given a capital structure with common stock  preferred stock and bonds outstanding the basic behavioral assumption is that the corporation seeks to maximize the benefits to its common stockholders  since the common stockholders hold the ultimate voting power over the corporations affairs in the case of the distribution of earnings  however  there are  by virtue of the system of permission and obligation schemata  two groups of claimants standing ahead of the common stockholders the bondholders and the preferred stockholders a relatively straightforward exercise in plan generation  see  e.g.   will therefore demonstrate that the expected cash dividend for each class of securityholders depends on the earnings available for distribution: unless the corporation is near bankruptcy  the bondholders will receive a fixed amount; beyond that  if the available earnings exceed the bond obligation  then the preferred stockholders will receive a dividend  but only up to the limit of the preferred stock obligation; and beyond that if earnings are still available  then the common stockholders will receive the rest we can summarize this analysis with the following expectation structure 

in which the function applied to the earnings depends in a systematic way on the identity of the  recipient security  but now  if we work with this projection of a security interest onto the apace of expectation schemata  instead of the projection onto the apace of permission and obligation schemata  we can define a mapping of the following sort 

1 where the xdn embedded inside the body is an elementary syntactic transformation with the distribution of cash as the invariant and the mapping from   function:common   earnings   to   function:preferred   earnings   as the residual transformation the  equity debt  mapping thus expresses the fact that the only difference between common stock and preferred stock in the space of expectation structures is the difference between the two functions which translate earnings into expected quantities of cash. another mapping is possible if we assume a reasonable probability distribution on the space of future earnings the quantities of cash would then inherit a probability distribution  too. and it would be apparent that the common stock has a high expected return and a high riak  while the preferre stock has a lower expected return and a lower risk this is the traditional way of describing the mapping between  equity  and  debt. for a discussion of the importance of this mapping in the arguments of eisner v. macomber  and its importance in the later corporate tax cases  see  and . 
iv conclusion 
　　although this paper has emphasized the differences between the  logical template  model of conceptual structure and the  prototype-pkis-deformetion* model  it is clear that both representations coexist in the corporate tax domain the patterns of reasoning observed in eisner v macomber persist throughout the later cases  see   there are strong pressures to formulate legal concepts as logical templates  if possible  but there are also strong countervailing tendencies to construct mappings from prototypes  and the tension between these two modes of representation provides the foundation for some of the major strategies of legal argument we believe that the key to understanding this process is a further exploration of the structure of maps and xdns. as set forth in the present paper 
　　our implementation of the taxman it theory has proceeded in several stages in the first stage  we developed the logical template representations and the associated pattern-matching procedures described in  and  as a step toward the implementation of the prototype-plus-deformation representation  we have extended the pattern-matching procedures to deal with partial matches  and we have added several heuristics to produce a plausible version of a  best match  result we are now working on an implementation of the xdn formalism an interpreter for the elementary transformations has been written  see  . and an initial implementation of xonapply has been tested out on the examples in the text the major work left to be done. then  is to define a search procedure in the space of maps which matches the observed procedures of justice pitney and justice brandeis in eisner v macomber once this step is completed  we should be able to model the major components of legal reasoning in the corporate tax domain we expect our results to be of interest to workers in several areas of artificial intelligence research  and of qemra  utility in various areas of application
