 
shared knowledge and b e l i e f s affect conversational situations in various ways. one aspect in which they play a role is the choice of r e f e r r i n g expressions. it is of interest to analyse this role since a natural language system must be able to decide when it can use a p a r t i c u l a r r e f e r r i n g expression; or a l t e r n a t i v e l y what a p a r t i c u l a r expression refers t o . in t h i s paper we attempt to formally characterise conditions for these. s p e c i f i c a l l y   we d i f f e r with the t r a d i t i o n a l notion of mutual knowledge and b e l i e f   state a conversational conjecture that convinces us to do so  express a weakened notion in a formal system for reasoning about knowledge  and show how this might be used to decide on satisfactory r e f e r r i n g expressions. it is desirable to express a 
weakened notion of mutual b e l i e f that p a r a l l e l s that for mutual knowledge; t h i s aspect is currently being investigated. 
1 	introduction 
b u i l t so that it mirrors in some way the reasoning process of humans  rather than doing reasoning that is purely l o g i c a l . this l a t t e r is an important c r i t e r i o n   since a system to be used in a conversational environment must be able to reason about the b e l i e f s of others in the same 
manner that they would about them. 
　　　insofar as producing cooperative behaviour impinges on the task of understanding and generating natural language  it is already evident that considerations of knowledge and b e l i e f are important for natural language processing. however  there are aspects of language processing that are affected more d i r e c t l y by beliefs and knowledge about others and of what beliefs and knowledge are shared with others. consider for example the aspect of using or understanding a r e f e r r i n g expression. in t r y i n g to refer to an object one takes recourse to the facts that one thinks or knows one's audience believes or knows; and a system that does not make the assumption that it communicates with people who know a l l that it knows must be able to do the same. 

　　　representing and reasoning about the knowledge and b e l i e f s of the participants in an i n t e r a c t i o n is an important consideration for a system like a natural language interface to a 
　　　knowledge base  designed to exhibit cooperative behaviour. the a b i l i t y   for example  to 
	understand the primary intent 	of 	a 	query 	or 
statement  
predict the expectations of the participants so as to attempt to s a t i s f y them  or 
	understand 	or 	use 	r e f e r r i n g 	expressions 
appropriately 
depend c r u c i a l l y on t h i s aspect of the system. the problem of designing an adequate representation and reasoning mechanism for knowledge and/or b e l i e f s and of using this to produce the desired behaviour  however  is a n o n - t r i v i a l one. f i r s t it is not quite clear what an appropriate representation for knowledge and b e l i e f in general i s . then  even if one of these representations is indeed s a t i s f a c t o r y   it is not quite clear how the reasoning system is to be thus it is clear that beliefs and knowledge do play a role in understanding and using r e f e r r i n g expressions. however  it is not clear what exactly is the role they play. this aspect has been considered e a r l i e r in  clark and marshall  1  and  perrault and cohen  1 . 
the i n t u i t i o n in these analyses seems to be that in using a d e f i n i t e description d to i d e n t i f y a p a r t i c u l a r object a  the speaker and his/her audience must mutually know  or believe  that the object a uniquely s a t i s f i e s the description d.* in our opinion  however  this condition is too strong; in conversational s i t u a t i o n s   if the speaker knows  or believes  that the hearer knows  or believes  that an object a  s a t i s f i e s the description d uniquely  then he/she often conjectures that t h i s is mutual knowledge  or a  
mutual 	b e l i e f   if there is no reason to doubt i t . 
thus a speaker may use the phrase 'the long haired 
swede who does not shave during the course of the wimbledon' to refer to bjorn borg even before

he/she knows that it is mutual knowledge that borg s a t i s f i e s this description. 
　　　we attempt to give formal expression to this idea in t h i s paper. in section 1 we describe a representation system that includes an 
axioraatisation of mutual knowledge and of ignorance. in section 1 we describe how this system can be used to give expression to the conjecture discussed above. 
1 	representation of knowledge 
	we shall use the representation 	proposed 	in 
 konolige  	1  	which 	is 	based 	on 	sato's k1 
 sato  	1  	and 	extended 	to 	include 	an 
axiomatisation 	of 	ignorance. 	k1 is a family of 
languages 	parameterised 	by 	the 	choice 	of 
propositional 	l e t t e r s 	pr 	and 	agents sp. 	for a 
p a r t i c u l a r 	choice 	of 	pr 	and 	sp  	k1 	is 	the 
propositional calculus over pr together with a set of indexed unary modal operators   s     s ♀ sp. the intended meaning of  s a for any sentence a is that s knows a. there is a s p e c i a l   f i c t i t i o u s agent 1 ♀ sp  used to axiomatise common knowledge; for any sentence a the intended meaning of a is that a is common knowledge. the axiom schemata 
for k1 are 
	 al  a l l propositional 	tautologies 
 a1   s a =  a 
	 a1  	 s a -   s  s a 
	 a1  	 s  a -  b  =    s a -   s b  
　　 a1  a =   s a where a and b are a r b i t r a r y sentences. k1 includes two rules of inference: modus ponens   i . e . from a and a -  b i n f e r b  and necessitation   i . e . from a infer  s a for any s e sp . 
　　　ka as defined above has been shown to be decidable. konolige uses t h i s fact to e x p l i c i t l y introduce the notion of p r o v a b i l i t y in ka into the l o g i c . the language of ka is extended to include a family of unary modal operators indexed by sentences of ka; these are w r i t t e n as  a  where a is a sentence of ka  and the intended meaning of  a b  where a and b are sentences of k1  is that a =  b is provable in ka. the new language is called k1. the axioms of k1a are then defined to be those of ka together with the schemata 
 a1   a b where ka i- a    b 
 a1  ~ a b where ka i- a -  b 
the two rules of inference are retained. since ka is decldable   a1  and  a1  form a recursive set. further for every a and b that are sentences of ka  e i t h e r  a b or ~ a b is a theorem of kia. given t h i s and that ka is decidable  it is easy to see that kia is also decldable. 
　　　the new l o g i c a l system is of interest since in it it is possible to p a r t i a l l y characterise an agent's ignorance. we can p a r t i t i o n an agent's knowledge into two sets - the f i r s t corresponds to his/her ' c o r e ' knowledge  and the second to the knowledge that is derived from the core knowledge. let b be the conjunction of the set of sentences that 	form 	the core knowledge of the agent s. 	if 
now a is 	 s b  then if ~ a c is provable in ki1 it can 	be 	concluded that the agent s is ignorant of 
c. note that this is only a p a r t i a l characterisation of s's ignorance; the claim that s knows d if  a d is deducible in the system is problematic since an agent need not know a l l the logical consequences of his/her core knowledge. 
　　　in the rest of this paper we shall be interested in interactions that involve two participants only. these w i l l be i d e n t i f i e d as the speaker s and the hearer h. any reference to ki1 made henceforth w i l l refer to the class of those theories for which sp = {1 h s}. 
1 	using and understanding referring expressions 
       in t h i s discussion we shall r e s t r i c t our a t t e n t i o n to one kind of r e f e r r i n g expression d e f i n i t e descriptions. a speaker who uses a d e f i n i t e description r e f e r e n t i a l l y may be thought of as doing so to enable his/her audience to pick out an object that he/she is t a l k i n g about. our objective is to characterise the conditions under which it is safe to use a description d to refer to an object a. 
　　　let p stand for the proposition :  the description d in the context c is uniquely s a t i s f i e d by a . in  clark and marshall  1  it is claimed that in order for the speaker to use d to refer to a  it must be the case that p is mutual knowledge; with respect to ki1 this amounts to saying that p is provable. it is argued in  perrault and cohen  1  that this condition is too strong; they present a series of examples from which they conclude  ignoring for the moment that they are dealing with b e l i e f rather than knowledge  that what is necessary is that in 
　　　　　 s p    s  h p a  s  h  s p a ... only a f i n i t e number of conjuncts should be false. 
　　　neither of these analyses is quite s a t i s f a c t o r y . f i r s t   despite the claim in  perrault and cohen  1   it seems that the speaker must know  or believe  that the hearer knows  or believes  that p is true in order to use d to refer to a. if t h i s were not the case there is no assurance for the speaker that the hearer 
w i l l understand what he/she is r e f e r r i n g to by d and hence w i l l make the proper connection; in fact t h i s is our i n t u i t i o n regarding the examples in  perrault and cohen  1 . second  and most important  in i n s i s t i n g that p be mutual knowledge 
 or 'almost' a mutual b e l i e f as in  perrault and cohen  1   an important conversational convention is being ignored - even if p is not 
mutual knowledge  or a mutual b e l i e f   it is often conjectured to be so given some positive evidence and no negative evidence. 
this consideration leads us to state that 
 t  s  h p a ~ t  s -p  where t is  s  b and b is the 	conjunction 	of 	the 

set of sentences that form the core knowledge of s  is a s u f f i c i e n t * condition for using d to refer to a. i n t u i t i v e l y   this condition says that s knows that h knows that p holds; moreover there is no reason to believe that s knows p is not 
mutual knowledge. 
　　　we can see the implication of this condition with reference to the example in section 1. while the e a r l i e r analyses would permit the use of the description for borg only in case the association between these two was mutual knowledge  this analysis permits the use of the description for borg given that the speaker knows that the hearer knows the association. 
　　　a similar analysis yields the following condition that we think is s u f f i c i e n t for understanding that d refers to a 
                t'  h p a ~ t'  h ~p where t' is  h b' and b' is the conjunction of the set of sentences that form the core knowledge of 
h. 
1 	on using belief 
in t r y i n g to decide whether a d e f i n i t e description may be used to r e f e r   it is necessary to make the d i s t i n c t i o n between 'successful reference'  where the speaker has a l l the right intentions and has conformed to a l l the right conventions in using a r e f e r r i n g expression  and a ' f u l l y consummated reference'  where uptake is also secured; the c r i t e r i o n to use is that of 'successful reference'  as pointed out in  perrault and cohen  1 . one implication of this is that what is of interest are the beliefs of the speaker  and not his/her knowledge. 
　　　a set of axiom scheraas similar to that of k1 has been developed for b e l i e f . in order to introduce the notion of p r o v a b i l i t y into the logic  something that is needed to express the notion of ignorance   it must be shown that the underlying logic is decidable. since the logic of interest is a propositional one  we conjecture that it i s . however this must be proved. we are currently pursuing t h i s aspect. we believe that in t h i s new formal system the ideas expressed in section 1 can be used to state conditions for the use and understanding of r e f e r r i n g expressions that are i n t u i t i v e l y more s a t i s f y i n g . 
* this condition is not necessary  because some situations can be constructed where reference may be successful even if it is not the case that 
 t  s1 h p.  the examples in  perrault and cohen  1   however  do not seem to be such cases . this conjunct is needed  since otherwise it does not seem warranted to conjecture p as a mutual b e l i e f . if t h i s condition is s u f f i c i e n t   then the condition in  perrault and cohen  1  is too strong  i . e . is not necessary.

1 	conclusion 
       in this paper we have considered an issue in which knowledge and b e l i e f play an important r o l e   and we have attempted to express certain i n t u i t i o n s in a formal manner. we grant that there are l i m i t a t i o n s in the formal expression  not the least of them being that we have used a c r u c i a l feature of propositional modal logics  that they are decidable. the point however is not so much in the solution advocated here  but in that there is a weaker notion of mutual knowledge  and of mutual b e l i e f   tha t is operative i n practice; and it is this that a system that reasons about knowledge and b e l i e f in order to produce cooperative behaviour must give expression to . 	~ 
　　　although we have limited our attention to only r e f e r r i n g expressions  there are other situations in which mutual knowledge and beliefs play a r o l e . one such s i t u a t i o n is that where in the course of an interaction the two participants discover that their beliefs are incompatible  and enter into a dialogue to correct this s i t u a t i o n . 
such interactions have been analysed in  joshi  1  in the context of a question-answer system. the assumption there was that in the end one of the participants beliefs should become a mutual b e l i e f as a result of the i n t e r a c t i o n . this requires very strong assumptions on the nature of discourse. a matter to be studied is whether the weakened notion of mutual b e l i e f is s u f f i c i e n t for most situations where the notion of mutual b e l i e f is needed at a l l ; and if so  whether this makes more r e a l i s t i c the assumptions required to ensure 
that a c l a r i f i c a t i o n dialogue succeeds.
