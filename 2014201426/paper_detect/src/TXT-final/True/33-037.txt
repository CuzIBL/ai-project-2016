 
　　　most research on narrative text summarisation has been conducted within the paradigm of experimental psychology. but recent language processing research in a r t i f i c i a l intelligence suggests that the predominant theory of text summarisation requires further examination. seemingly minor structural modifications of a story can reault in aignificant alterations of summary behavior. in this paper  highlights of summary data from 1 subjects are presented and analyzed in terms of two competing summarization models:  1  the story grammar model of psychology  and  1  the plot unit model developed in a r t i f i c i a l intelligence. we w i l l show how selected story grammar predictions compare to plot unit predictions for short term summarization and then identify two complicating factors that have a major impact on summarisation behavior. 
1. 	introduction 
　　　while experiments using people may seem less relevant to a r t i f i c i a l intelligence than experiments using computers  the work described in this paper represents more than an intellectual commitment to psychological validity in ai  although that commitment is also present . the task of text summarisation is one of the most complicated challanges facing natural language processing and poasibly facing ai altogether. we need a l l the help we can get. 
　　　we have been working in recent years at yale on a story understanding system  boris   1  whose theoretical roots go back to the margie system . while an i n i t i a l implementation toward summarisation has been completed in boris    we have not yet been able to test our most important intuitions using boris. we probably won't be able to u t i l i s e boris for this purpose u n t i l it can process a large number of prototype stories. in the meantime  we have been conducting exploratory psychological experiments  to see how our ideas hold up against systems that can summarize a large number of stories. the results have been both surprising and encouraging.

1. 	plot units: 	a heterarchical representation 
	plot units  originally called  affect 	units   
1  lead to general graphs that are typically cyclic in their atructure rather than hierarchical. a plot unit ia a fixed configuration of mental states and events involving one or more characters in a atandard behavioral pattern or interaction. for example  there are plot units that represent honored requests  problem resolution  retaliation  broken promises  and obligations. 
　　　all plot units are constructed from smaller primitive components called  affect states.  there are three kinds of affect states  designed to encode mentsl states  positive events  and negative events. the internal structure of a plot unit is governed by strict rules to control the various ways affect states can be linked to each other   1     but the most important property of a plot unit representation lies in the fact that plot units can overlap with each other. two plot units overlap when they both contain a common affect state. for example  suppose john asks mary to buy an artichoke  and she does so. the unit describing john's honored request w i l l overlap with the unit describing mary's success because they both share the same positive event of mary buying an artichoke. this event is a c r i t i c a l component for both mary's success and john's request: 
wants mary to john mary buy artichoke wants to buy 
artichoke buys artichoke mary buys artichoke 
over lappings between top-level units provide us with the structure of a plot unit analysis. in the representational graph  nodes represent instantiated plot units  and arcs join two nodes whenever the corresponding plot units share a common affect state. 
　　　each plot unit is associated with generational frames. generational frames drive the natural language expression of instantiated plot units  and a l l units are associated with both strong  detailed  and weak  sketchy  generational frames. 
stronger frames are used when there is strong

connectivity and weaker frames are used when connectivity is weak. the process of summarizing a story is partly a function of structural connectivity  and partly a function of generational frame management. 
1. 	three storiea and six story representations 
　　　to compare story grammars with plot units  we f i r s t designed three variations on a baseline story and collected 1 summaries on each variation for a total of 1 summaries  using 1 subjects . all experimental materials were presented as typed text. after reading the text  subjects were asked to produce a written summary in one or two sentences. the three stories  see appendix a  are very cloae to each other in overall content. they each involve a deeply nested set of subgoals which the main character devises and achieves. the differences can be summarized as follows: 
　　　while not a l l propositions appear in a l l stories  the pairvise ordering of a l l propositions remains consistent throughout. it is never the case that proposition a is higher than proposition b in one tree  and lower in another. story grammars predict inclusion on the basis of relative tree position. for example  the story grammar model predicts that proposition pi w i l l appear more frequently than proposition p1 across a l l story 
versions: 
pi: get boss to send paul away 
p1: mike makes deal with accountant 
since 	we 	w i l l 	be 	concentrating 	on 	such 
hierarchicial predictions  we should mention that the   c r i t i c a l path  model of black and bower predicts that failed goals and plans w i l l violate the hierarchical inclusion principle in the sense that failure-associated nodes are unlikely to be 


1 

plot unit predictions are based on the connectivity or degree of each unit in the plot unit graph. highly connected unite are sore likely to appear in summaries than weakly connected unite. 

in keeping with the   c r i t i c a l path  hypothetic  we have omitted the failure-related unite  the dr's and the paf't  eince we do not expect them to show up in the summaries.  our data supported c r i t i c a l path prediction! . 
　　　to see exactly what theee connectivities predict  we suet consider the generational frames for each of the relevant units. since plot units can be described with varying levels of d e t a i l   we w i l l include a strong and a weak frame for each. strong frames are more likely to appear when units are highly connected while weak frames are more likely to appear for weakly connected units. 
　　　the strong generational frame for nested agency is meant to include the f i r s t agent in the chain  the agent cloaeat to x. in our stories  this agent is the accountant  rather than paul'a boss who is further away from mike in the eucceasful chain . 
　　　in determining whether a given unit is present in a summary  we naturally cannot expect to find verbatim generational framea. some f l e x i b i l i t y is needed to recognise verba like  bribe    bargain   or  negotiate  as weak evidence of an rhc unit. in our stories  strong evidence of the rhc1 unit is represented by mentioning what mike gave to the cpa  grata . 
　　　some examples of inatantiated generational framea are given below: 

nsl weak : 
 hike got paul out of town.  
rhcl weak : 
 hike had successful negotiations with an accountant. 
nal strong : 
 hike arranged with an accountant to have paul sent out of town.  
1. 	selected data analysis 
　　　a comprehensive analysis of a l l the data would show that story grammars and plot units agree on many predictions. for example  both models correctly predicted that hike's interaction with the drug dealer was least likely to show up in summaries. to tease apart the two models  we w i l l examine summary data in four  target  areas where their predictions d i f f e r . 
target 	area 	1: 	 hike 	gives 	graas 	to 	the accountant.  
　　the story grammar predictions for this proposition are largely uniform across a l l three stories. this proposition appears at level 1 in si respect to the maximal connectivity within each graph  max sl - 1  max s1    1  max s1  - 1 . the differences in relstive unit strength lead us to expect a difference in the frequencies of our target proposition for si  s1  and s1. s1 summaries should include the target proposition 
more often than s1 summaries  and s1 ahould exhibit a higher frequency than s1. the data confirms the plot unit prediction: 

 note: a l l percentile compariaions across stories in this paper pass the chi-equare test for significance at the .1 level unless otherwise specified . 

target area 	1: 	 the boat lends paul away.  
　　　again  the atory grammar predictions are f a i r l y uniform. mike's goal concerning paul's boss appears at level 1 in si and s1  and at level 1 in s1. this suggests that the proposition w i l l be mentioned most often for s1  and slightly less often for s1 and s1  but with equal frequency for si and s1. 
　　　the plot unit predictions are based on the connectivity of ns1 and ns1. a review of our generational frames and nested success unit instantiations shows that the target proposition only appears when ns1 is strongly present or ns1 is present  either weakly or strongly . using the same computation of unit strength described above  we see that ns1 and ns1 appear with varying degrees of stength: 
if the effects of ns1 and ns1 are taken into account with equal weight  we expect that summaries of s1 are most likely to mention the boss  with summaries of s1 and s1 somewhat less likely to mention i t . since the strength values in s1 and s1 cancel each other out  we would furthermore expect si and s1 to exhibit equal fequencies. this analysis coincides perfectly with the story grammar analysis. but an alternative plot unit analysis points to a different prediction. 
　　　notice that we need a strong generational frame for ns1  and ns1 appears with only moderate strength at best. if nested success units require strong connectivity for a strong generational frame  then a l l mention of the boss would be coming exclusively from ns1. if the effects of ns1 are discounted for not being strong enough  we would expect s1 summaries to mention the boss more often than s1 summaries since ns1 is stronger in s1 than in s1. 
　　　both models predict that s1 summaries w i l l describe the boss sending paul away more often than the s1 and s1 summaries. but only a plot unit analysis can explain why s1 summaries might mention this more often than s1 summaries: 

target area 1:  the boss sends paul away.  vs.  mike makes a deal with an accountant.  
　　　in addition to comparing frequency distributions for single propositions across a l l three stories  we can also compare the relative frequency distributions for two propositione within each story. to see how two propositions should compare  we w i l l look at their relative tree positions and graph connectivities: 


within each 	story 	the 	predictions 	are 	uniform. 
story grammars predict that the deal with the accountant w i l l be mentioned leas often than the boss sending paul away because the deal occurs at a lower level in the tree. plot units predict that these two propositions w i l l be mentioned with equal frequency for each story version  since their connectivity rankings are identical in each story. 
　　　the data w i l l show that the plot unit prediction is confirmed for s1  and neither model is confirmed for s1 and s1  although the plot unit predictions are closer to the data in these cases than the story grammar predictions: 

in stories s1 and s1  the deal with the cpa appears significantly more often than the boss sending paul away. it is also significant that the deal with the cpa appears with uniform frequency across a l l three stories*** since a plot unit analysis comparing the rhc1 unit across the three stories would not predict uniform frequency. a confounding factor which we w i l l dub  generational subsumption  appears to be at work in s1 and s1. we w i l l discuss this complication in section 1. 
target area 1: 	 mike wanted to build a patio.  
　　　this proposition did not appear in s1  but it was part of s1 and s1. a atory grammar analysis places this proposition at the head of the tree structure  which affords it the highest possible probability for inclusion. in the plot unit analysis  the patio goal appears only in the sub unit which is ranked weakly for both stories. in s1  sub is ranked with less strength than ns1 
 which showed up in only 1 summary . 	in s1  sub is ranked 	with the same strength as ns1  which showed up in 1 summaries . 
　　　in this case  the story grammar predictions were clearly supported by the data. all 1 si-subjects and a l l 1 s1-subjects mentioned the patio goal in their summaries. in fact  the f i r s t sentence in 1 of the 1 summaries sound exactly like clear-cut examples of the subgoal unit generational frame: 
 since the data presented in target area #1 showed that ns1 had no influence over the frequency for the boas sending paul away  we w i l l discount ns1 here as well. the only unit that can carry the boas sending paul away ia ns1. 
**the 	difference 	between 	.1 	and 	.1 	is 	not significant. 
1 *** 	the 	differences 	in 	.1 .1 .1 	are 	not significant. 
 mike vented to make hit old friend paul leave town for e few deye to thet he could build him a 
eurpriee present in hit 
 mike wanted to build hit friend paul a patio for hie birthday  but he had to get peul out of town for a couple of daya to do so.  
 mike wants to get his old friend paul out of town for e few dayt to he can build a patio at paul's house as a surprise   
while the story greener model it one clear explanation for this overwhelming consentut  a self-containment factor could also be operating here. we w i l l discuss this in the next section. 
1. 	generational subsumption and self-containment 
　　　both etory grammars and plot units attempt to predict summarization behavior in terms of internal memory representations. 
　　　the plot unit graph providee an important predictive element by revealing connectivity properties. but generetionel fremee must be teken into coneideration as well. for example  mike's goal of getting paul out of town was mentioned by e l l 1 subjects  yet the ns1 unit which contains this goel in i t s top-level eucceee etructure is not strongly predicted in any of the plot unit graphs. however  the plot unit analysis is s t i l l consistent with the summary data aince the neated agency unit  na  ia strongly predicted in a l l graphs  and na cannot be expreesed without deecribing mike's goal to get rid of peul. in this case  we say that na subsumes ns1 for the purposes of generation. 
　　　a similar form of generational subsumption across plot units occurs in the summaries for s1 and s1 when the deal with the accountant is mentioned. we saw in our discussion of target area #1 how the deal with the accountant was mentioned with uniform frequency across a l l three stories. this violated the different connectivity rankings that rmc1 assumed in s1  s1  end s1  along with the plot unit predictions for s1 and s1 deacribed in target area #1. but generational frames provide us with en explanation for thia. conaider the generational frames for a request honored with a condition and a netted agency: 
na  strong : x arranged to have y get z done 
rhc1  weak : x made a deal with y 
since the ma unit it strongly connected in 	s1 	and 
s1  we know we have a commitment to the strong na generational frame. we also have rhc1 weakly connected in s1 end moderately connected in s1. if we take the number of words involved at a rough indicator of complexity  it ia no harder to generete  na strong  + rhcl weak   than it is to generate m na strong   alone: 
ma t : 
mike arranged to have an accountant get paul out of town. 
na s    rhcl v : 
mike made a deal with an accountant to get paul out of town. 
while the effort involved in generating theee two concepts it not aignificantly different  there ii a significant difference in their content. 
m na   rhcl  is much more specific than  na  by i t s e l f . this makes it optimally efficient to generate the weak frame for rhc1 whenever the strong frame for na is being generated: 

the strong frame for rhc1 is not pulled in 	by 	the 
na unit  because it requires more effort; an additional phrase must be generated to express rhc1 strongly: 
na s    rhcl v : 
hike made a deal with an accountant to get paul out of town. 
na s  + rhcks : 
mike made a deal with an accountant to get paul out of town in exchange for some grass. 
　　　generational subsumption is not structural by nature. it is language dependent  and tightly bound up with the complexities of language generation. 
　　　another confounding factor may be lurking behind the overwhelming presence of the subgoal unit  as discussed in target area #1. when people evaluate summaries  they are sensitive to how self-contained a summary sounds. it seems ressonable that this sensitivity to self-containment would enter into the summarization process as well. 
　　　while the plot unit analysis for s1 and s1 t e l l s us that getting paul out of town is the most importent top-level goal  this is not a very self-contained goal. why would mike want to get his friend out of town for a weekend  are his motives good or bad  what's he up to  the goal begs for an explanation. 
　　　to aee what role self-containment might be playing in s1 and s1  we examined data from two additional stories that are structurally identical to s1 and s1 in these new stories  a farmer replaces mike  and a donkey replaces paul. inatead of mike wanting to build a patio  the farmer wants to go to a aquare dance. and inatead of mike 
1 wanting to get rid of paul  the farmer wanta to put the donkey in i t s shed.* while the subgoal structure remains the tame  the goal of wanting to put a donkey in its thed it much more telf-contained than the goal of wanting to get rid of paul  given thia ahift of the self-containment *our mike/paul stories were intpired by the original farmer/donkey story found in 1 . 
f a c t o r   we can re-examine the d i f f e r i n g atory grammar and p l o t u n i t p r e d i c t i o n s in terms of the summary data c o l l e c t e d for sla and s1a. as before* 1 subjects provided summaries for each s t o r y . this time the r e s u l t s were d r a m a t i c a l l y d i f f e r e n t : 
si sla s1 s1a  sub 1   .1 1 .1 .1 　　　while the frequencies of the sub u n i t s in sla and s1a are not q u i t e as low as the p l o t unit analysis might have suggested  they are s i g n i f i c a n t l y lower than the frequencies found for the sub u n i t s in s1 and s1. these descrepancies are even more s t r i k i n g when the o v e r a l l data for sla  s1a and s1a are compared to the data for s i   
s1  and s1. a l l three farmer/donkey s t o r i e s showed extremely uniform frequency d i s t r i b u t i o n s for most p r o p o s i t i o n s . even so  the subgoal unit was the only n o n - f a i l u r e - r e l a t e d u n i t to display v a r i a n t behavior. this suggests that the p l o t u n i t p r e d i c t i o n s would be f u r t h e r substantiated under better experimental c o n d i t i o n s . 
1. 	conclusions 
       from these experiments we conclude that summarization behavior is a f u n c t i o n of i n t e r n a l memory s t r u c t u r e s along w i t h other n o n - s t r u c t u r a l f a c t o r s . by focusing on areas where p l o t u n i t p r e d i c t i o n s d i f f e r e d from story story grammar p r e d i c t i o n s   we 1aw that p l o t u n i t s predicted s t r u c t u r a l influences more e f f e c t i v e l y than story grammars in three out of four cases. when the s t r u c t u a l l y - b a s e d p l o t u n i t p r e d i c t i o n s f e l l down  we saw how n o n - s t r u c t u r a l f a c t o r s of generational subsumption and self-containment could have been operating t o override s t r u c t u r a l i n f l u e n c e s . i n the one case where story grammars appeared to be a clear winner over p l o t u n i t s   a d d i t i o n a l experimental data suggests that the o r i g i n a l l y unsuccessful p l o t u n i t p r e d i c t i o n might have been overridden by a confounding f a c t o r of pelf-containment which no s t r u c t u r a l model can address. 
       a l l in a l l   the p l o t u n i t model is holding up w e l l against experimental data  and appears to provide a promising basis for summarization a l g o r i t h m s .
