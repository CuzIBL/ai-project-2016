 
   this work is concerned with the problem of reasoning about physical objects and their positions in the space. the main goal is to develop a system which is able to  imagine  the scene in which a story takes place  inferring by means of suitable rules the items which are not explicitly named  in order to verify the relevance of knowledge about the physical environment in the process of stories understanding. the specific topic covered by this work is the problem of objects instantiation and a set of rules for inferring the existence of an object is proposed. 
i introduction 
   the problem of processing visual information can be approached under several points of view and with different goals. firstly  the concept i t s e l f of  visual information  can cover a wide range of information types  from elementary visual patterns to the knowledge about physical objects and their organization in complex scenes  possibly involving the interpretation of actors goals from their movements. secondly such a knowledge can be handled  for instance  with the aim of supporting a recognition process or with the goal of verifying the role of imagination in the process of stories understanding. this second goal did not receive in the past the same attention deserved to the f i r s t one. basic works are due to  boggess  1   
 heskovits  1    keirsey  1    lehnert  1    sondheimer  1    waltz  1   and to the 
 gestaltisten   kanitza  legrenzi and meazzini  1   but up to now the problem has been only scratched. 
   in this work we are faced with high level visual information  that is the representation and manipulation of knowledge about physical objects  their positions in a given environment  actions involving their use and so on. our main long term goal is to analyze how the inferential activities required to understand a story are affected by the knowledge about the physical characteristics of the environment of the story i t s e l f   what specific reasoning rules are used to handle physical objects and how * work supported by m.p.i  under grant 1. such a reasoning capabilities can be implemented in an  anthropomorphic  robot. the f i r s t step to-
wards the integration of what we call  visual knowl edge  into a general purpose inferential system consists of building the scene sketched in a story. this generation activity requires a basic capability of instantiating and positioning objects  which can seem a t r i v i a l problem but needs a surprisingly large amount of knowledge  due to the fact that most of the scene is usually not directly described in the story. 
   in the following we w i l l discuss some basic inferential rules restricted to the case of static scenes and dealing with  local reasoning   that is reasoning based on knowledge which can be extracted from a single conceptualization or a single spatialrelationship between two objects. this set of rules is under implementation in a conversational system  called nausica  which uses italian language as communication mean and a conceptual dependency like formalism for its internal conceptual represen tation  adorni  ansaldi  di manzo and stringa  1    adorni  boccalatte and di manzo  1    schank  1 . 
ii part-of instantiation mechanism 
   the part-of relation is used to express a functional connection between objects  as  for instance 
 leg part-of table    branch part-of tree    lock part-of door . the existence of a part-of relation does not always imply a physical connection between the involved objects; however such a connection is necessary in order use the object  which is part-of  in accordance to its normal functional characteristics  and this gives rise to the expecta tion of a physical  connection  if there are no specific reasons to reject this hypothesis. in the following we present some examples of conditions that have been proved to be useful in order to accept or reject the implicit instantiation. from here on  if  a is part-of b   a w i l l be referred to as the sub-part object and b as the whole object. 
a. consistency checks 
   when the whole is instantiated  the position of the sub-part with respect to the whole can be i n ferred from the structural description of the whole itself  even within approximate constraints. the 
   
position of the whole must be in turn inferred from knowledge about its typical locations in a given  or assumed  environment. thus  for instance  the sentence  the branch on the roof  allows us to assume an outdoor environment because of the on relation and the roof object  while the branch can be considered part-of a tree. a tree  in an outdoor environment  suggests something like a garden  a garden can be inferred from knowledge about the liv ing environment of a tree   where its typical position is vertical and in physical contact with the ground. from the structural description of a tree we obtain a possible position of the branch which is consistent with the relation  on the roof   given that a roof is part-of a house  and a garden can be around a house. we will call this kind of consistency check a position check. other consistency checks are related to object dimensions and supporting capabilities. 
b. containers 
   when the sub-part object is in x  where x is any object having the basic function of storing things  the instantiation of the whole object is often uncertain. let's consider the sentence  the lock in the store-room : even if an instantiated 
door can be put inside a store-room  without f a i l ing the previously mentioned consistency checks  this is not the scene commonly imagined; it is much 
more likely that the listener thinks simply of a stored lock. 
c. supports 
   if we hear that  the engines were roaring on the track   we probably instantiate a number of cars racing or ready to start; on the contrary  it is unlikely that the sentence  the engine is roaring on the bench  suggests a car on the bench. in the second sentence the sub-part object is on an object having the function of giving support; if there are not specific reasons to do the opposite  a direct support is supposed and the whole object is not instantiated. 
	1ll 	contained instantiation mechanism 
   there is a class of objects which usually need to be contained by some specific container. we will refer to objects of this class as  fluid  objects. liquids are a typical example of fluid objects  but also solid objects made of a large number of small  disconnected parts exibit similar properties  at least from the point of view of the use of containers  and therefore they can classified as f l u ids. when a fluid object is addressed some specific containers must be implicitly instantiated if there are no explicit references to them. the kind of con tainer may depend on the type of fluid or on the assumed environment or both . there are however some constraints to f u l f i l l in order to make reasonable the implicit instantiation of a container. 
	g. adorni et al. 	1 
a. consistency checks 
   unlike what happens with the part-of instantiation mechanism  if the fluid is the subject of a spatial relationship  then the supposed container usually inherits such a relationship; therefore consistency can be checked using those interpretation rules which are typical of the i n volved relation. for instance  the phrase 'the beer on the table  implies a relation like  a glass on the table   which can be accepted  while in the phrase  the sugar in the lock   the interpretation rules of the in relationship reject the hypothesis of  a sugar-basin in the lock . 
b. locations 
   the instantiation of a container is usually rejected if its inferred location is very unusual  in our everyday experience. if  for instance  we say  the coffee on the wall   probably the listener will not imagine the coffee inside a coffee-pot hung up on the wall; it is much more likely to suppose that  for some accident  coffee splashed up 
to the wal1. 
c. object characteristics 
   some kind of fluid objects usually do not lead to the instantiation of specific containers. they are typically  natural fluids  which exist in outdoor environments in a free state  or the remainder of some physical or manufacturing process   the sand on the floor  . the assumed environment can play a relevant role. some fluids  for i n stance  are much more likely to require a specific container in an indoor than in an outdoor environment   the water on the table  against  the water on the street  . 
iv state conditions 
   some objects require the presence of other objects  often depending on the environment  in order to mantain a good physical state. such state conditions are typical of living objects; so  if we say  the fish on the table   some water must be i n stantiated in order to create a suitable living environment for the fish. in most cases the implicit instantiation is based on the assumption that the living object is in a good physical state; this assumption is acceptable if there is no contrary evidence. some environments  however  can lead to rejection of such an assumption  and therefore no implicit instantiation is required: an example can be  the fish in the fishmonger's shop . state condi tions can hold also for not living objects. the most common case is related to not-embedding assump tions; hence  if we say  the plane is hidden in the mountain   a cave is instantiated. 
v other instantiation mechanisms 
   there is a set of basic mechanisms which can be used both to directly instantiate objects and 
   
1 g. adorni et al. to check i n s t a n t i a t i o n s made by means of part-of or contained r e l a t i o n s . in t h i s section we w i l l b r i e f l y discuss three of them  namely the sub-part  the support and the content. 
a. sub-part 
¡¡¡¡when the geometric s t r u c t u r e of the prototype of a class of objects is described  usually only few elements can be assumed to be always present in every i n s t a n t i a t i o n ; a number of optional v a r i ations must  be taken i n t o account  which are not. i n s t a n t i a t e d unless there are s p e c i f i c reasons to do i t . generally  an optional sub-part  a drawer f o r a t a b l e   f o r instance  is i n s t a n t i a t e d only i f i t i s e x p l i c i t l y mentioned; however  there are cases in which it must be i n f e r r e d to make a spat i a l r e l a t i o n reasonable. for example  if we say that  the p e n c i l is in the t a b l e     we must infer a sub-part of the table usable as a container  otherwise we should suppose the pencil embedded in the t a b l e ; t h e r e f o r e   if an optional drawer is described in the table prototype  it. w i l l be i n s t a n t i a t ed. 
b. support 
¡¡¡¡the support i n s t a n t i a t i o n mechanism may be a c t i vated when a supporting action between two objects is i n f e r r e d ; t h i s usually happens when an on r e l a t i o n is asserted or assumed. to accept the sup-
port hypothesis a number of consistency checks must succeed  i n v o l v i n g the weight of the supported obj e c t   material and s t r u c t u r e of the supporting one and so on. one of t h i s check is concerned with the c a p a b i l i t y of the supported object to man tain a physical contact with the supporter; f o r instance  a f l y on the wall has t h i s c a p a b i l i t y   while a pic ture on the wall has not. in the second case  an intermediate support must be i n f e r r e d   if possible  a n a i l in the case of the p i c t u r e on the w a l l   . 
c. content 
¡¡¡¡many o b j e c t s   expecially if they define environments   l i v i n g room  garden and so on  may cause expectations for some s p e c i f i c content.for example  to say   l i v i n g room  suggests a p a r t i c u l a r indoor view with some typical pieces of f u r n i t u r e . 
 therefore  a sentence as  the plant in the l i v i n g room  r e s u l t s in the i m p l i c i t i n s t a n t i a t i o n   for instance  of armchairs  sofa  smal1 tables and ever y other object which is commonly in such a room. vi concluding remarks 
¡¡¡¡we w i l l conclude g i v i n g one simple example of a coordinate use of the proposed mechanisms and of the system c a p a b i l i t i e s at the current stage of implementation. 
let us consider the phrase:  a plant in the l i v i n g room . the l i v i n g room  through the content mechanism  r e s u l t s in the i n s t a n t i a t i o n of a room with i t s t y p i c a l accessories. the s t r u c t u r e of the room  dimensions  p o s i t i o n of door  windows and so on  as well as the p o s i t i o n of i t s content is chosen by d e f a u l t ; in the same way is f i x e d the point of view under which the whole scene is generated.the plant-  because of state conditions  requires some earth   i n a l i v i n g room a plant is supposed a l i v e   ; state conditions give also the expected r e l a t i v e po s i t i o n s of the plant and t.he e a r t h . earth in an indoor environment has f l u i d c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s   so it requires a proper container  a big pot. in an indoor environment   whose default l o c a t i o n is on 
the f l o o r   i f another spatial r e l a t i o n follows as  for instance   the plant  is on the t a b l e     the same 
assumed environment  a l i v i n g room  is mantained  since it can contain the object   a table  used as new local reference. the p r i n c i p l e of  minimum number of objects  is followed avoiding to i n s t a n t i a t e another p l a n t   and possibly another t a b l e   if one instance of such objects already exists;hence the new sentence simply r e s u l t s in removing one of the inferences done during the analysis of the f i r s t one  the pot on the f l o o r     p o s i t i o n i n g 
again the pot in accordance to t.he new 	information.
