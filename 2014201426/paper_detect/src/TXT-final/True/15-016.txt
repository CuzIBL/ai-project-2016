within such stories is often expressed in terms of sayings  or c u l t u r a l adages  which then effectively characterize these stories. these same planning f a i l u r e s also provide indexing structures for both the storage and subsequent retrieval from long-term episodic memory of narrative episodes involving similar errors in planning. consequently  when people encounter similar episodes  either in real l i f e situations  or vicariously in narratives  they experience spontaneous remindings  schank 1  of related stories which i l l u s t r a t e the same moral. a theory for extracting the moral of a story  along with remindings of related episodes  is currently begin designed and developed in order to extend the theoretical and practical scope of the boris  dyer 1  story understanding program. 
a. 	background 
   previous story understanding systems developed at yale displayed their comprehension by performing tasks of translation  summarization  e.g. frump 
 dejong 1   or question-answering  e.g. qualm  lehnert 1  . however  after reading a story and performing i t s respective task  these programs threw away the results of their work. consequentl y   previous stories were never involved in subse-
quent comprehension processes. ipp  lebowitz 1  was one exception  since it retained a summary of each story  which it then used in forming generalizations. for example  if ipp read three stories of bombings in ireland  and in each case carried out by the ira  then ipp formed a generalization that bombings in ireland are done by the ira. the next time ipp read about bombings in ireland  it used t h i s generalization to predict ira responsibility. 
   while ipp represented an important advance over other story understanders which f a i l e d to remember what they had read  ipp was limited in both the depth of i t s understanding and the way it indexed stories read. as a skimmer  ipp mainly f i l l e d roles in frame-like structures  minsky 1 . as a r e s u l t   ipp could only index stories by means of s i m i l a r i t i e s and differences in role bindings. 
   in contrast to ipp and frump  which as skimmers read many stories but b u i l t r e l a t i v e l y sparse conceptual representations for them   boris  lehnert  dyer et a l . 1  was designed to read a few stories in great depth  extracting a detailed conceptual representation involving scripts  plans  goals  schank and abelson 1   settings  affects {dyer 1b  interpersonal relationships  and planning f a i l u r e s organized in terms of abstract thematic structures  called taus  dyer 1 . 
   this paper discusses extensions to boris which involve remembering previous episodes in memory during the comprehension of novel stories. these theoretical extensions are under design and development in a program called morris  moral and reminding inference system . morris is intended to read a story in depth  and perform a careful 
analysis of the appropriateness of character actions. as a result of this analysis  morris w i l l extract the moral of the story  in terms of abstract planning advice  and use t h i s moral as an indexing structure for storage of the story in long-term episodic memory. whenever a later story is read  which can be analyzed in terms of the same abstract planning advice  morris w i l l be reminded of the prior story. furthermore  morris should be able to express i t s advice in terms of an appropriate cultural saying  or adage. unlike ipp  remindings which occur in morris w i l l be based upon recognizing inappropriate planning situations at an abstract l e v e l . thus  remindings in morris need not be based simply on indexing by roles and frames. 
b. 	indexing stories in episodic memory 
   often  when people read a story  they are spontaneously reminded of previous stories  or personal experiences . why is t h i s the case  what makes a story memorable and worth t e l l i n g over and over again  as in certain parables and fables   or worth recalling in the right context  
   in t h i s paper i argue that one class of remindings occur as the result of a complex analysis of the appropriateness of character plans  actions  or reactions to various goal situations  interpersonal relationships  and other conceptual structures of significance w i t h i n the story. when a character responds inappropriately or i n e f f e c t i v e l y   the error is recognized by the reader  and the conse-
quences of that character's actions are predicted. as a result  the story carries with it a moral  or

i m p l i c i t advice in planning  which the reader may be able to employ in r e a l - l i f e for future planning in related situations. the most generally applicable types of advice become s o l i d i f i e d in the adages  or sayings of our culture. such adages  for instance  give us abstract advice concerning: 
- timing of plans   a s t i t c h 	in 	time 	saves nine.   
- plans for satisfying recurring goals     k i l l the goose which lays golden eggs.   
- assessing risks in planning   the cure is worse than the disease.   
- coordinating planning with others   too many cooks spoil the broth.   
- counterplanning and vulnerability   throwing stones when you l i v e in a glass house.   cutting off your nose to spite your face  . 
- affect reactions during 	plan/goal 	f a i l u r e 
  crying before the milk is even s p i l t .     
	in boris  such planning advice is 	organized 	by 
talis  thematic abstraction units  which represent situations in which planning errors brought about goal f a i l u r e s . see  dyer  1 . 
c. 	remindings during comprehension 
   by way of i l l u s t r a t i o n   consider the following episode  which actually happened to the author : 
garage trip: i was taking a friend to a garage to pick up his car. he started t a l k ing about how they had promised to have it ready  but he hadn't called them to make sure. he became convinced that the car 
wouldn't be ready  and how annoying that would be  and he became more and more upset. when we arrived  his car was a l l f i x e d . 
   at the point that my friend began getting really upset  i t o l d him to quit bleeding before he'd even been cut. i was also spontaneously reminded of a humorous story i had not thought of in years  and whose author or source i can not r e c a l l   . of course i now told him the story as we drove to the garage. i have t r i e d to recapture below the flavor of t h i s story as it was f i r s t t o l d to me: 
out of gas: a man was driving along a lonely road late at night when his car ran out of gas. he remembered seeing a farm house a mile back  and so started walking toward i t . as he walked along he thought:   i t ' s pretty l a t e . if someone were to awaken me at t h i s hour  i might be pretty annoyed.  he kept on thinking along these l i n e s :  the farmer w i l l have to get dressed and siphon gas out of his tractor for me. he may f i n d that very inconvenient...  as he approached the farmhouse he became more and more annoyed. 
the farmer was awakened by loud knocking at his door. when he went down to answer i t   there stood a man who larked:  who needs your stupid gas anyway!  and then stomped off into the night. 
   clearly  both the actual garage trip episode and the out of gas humorous story involve car troubles. however  there are numerous other instances of car breakdowns that i could have recalled  and yet they did not come to mind at that time. the key to my reminding was the moral  or planning advice in out of gas. this advice was appropriate to garage trip and is expressed in our culture by such adages as  crying before the milk is even s p i l t   or  bleeding before one's been cut . but what was the mechanism which allowed me to extract both a moral and a reminding from the garage trip episode  
   at the level of abstract planning  in both cases some individual x became emotionally upset at a s i tuation s which involved anticipating a goal f a i l u r e before x knew for sure that s had occurred. thus  the moral of each story might be expressed in planning terms as follows: 
tau-emot-anticipate: when anticipating a negative situation  don't act as if the f a i l u r e has occurred  since this wastes energy that could be better used in planning ways of recovering from the f a i l u r e   if indeed one has occurred. furthermore  getting upset may make things worse  by interfering with planning about what to do next. 
   in out of gas  the driver was so upset that he rejected help before even requesting i t . 
   this planning advice is rather sophisticated  involving interaction between plan f a i l u r e s   the 
appropriateness of anticipating f a i l u r e in planning  and the effect of emotional reactions in the face of planning f a i l u r e s . 
   upon realizing that my friend was wasting energy and suffering emotionally in anticipation of an unproven f a i l u r e   i had indexed the situation in terms of the appropriate abstract planning theme. at t h i s point  both the adage and narrative episode which shared the most content features   i . e . a story i l l u s t r a t i n g tau-emot-anticipate which also involved a broken car  came to mind. so  not only 
was i able to advise my friend of the inappropriateness of his behavior in terms of i t s overall effectiveness  but i could also i l l u s t r a t e my advice 
with a vicarious episode from my own experience. 
d. 	in-depth 	thru plan analysis 
   this level of story understanding is one of the deepest possible  for other thematic levels  see  lehnert 1    schank 1   wilensky 1  . summarization  translation and question answering tasks are not guaranteed to reveal t h i s level of comprehension. for instance we could ask the f o l lowing questions regarding out of gas: 
q: what was wrong with the d r i v e r ' s car  a: i t was out of gas. 

q: why did the driver go to the farmer's house  a: to get help. 
	q: 	what woke up the farmer  
	a: 	the driver knocked on his door. 
and s t i l l miss the point of the story. the best way to reveal this level of understanding is through spontaneous remindings of episodes with similar themes  along with the generation of advice in the form of a moral  saying  or adage. this deep level of analysis requires sophisticated knowledge of plans  including: 
- the goals they normally serve 
- a history of successes and failures for each planning situation 
- their enablement conditions  along with timing  e f f o r t   etc. 
   consider how morris w i l l work for the following  much simpler story  which involves a planning error in terms of cost: 
face lift: b i l l was a poor student. one day he discovered that he had a single acne pimple on his chin. he decided to go see a plastic surgeon and have his face l i f t e d . 
   here b i l l chose an overly costly plan to achieve a goal which could be achieved by equally effect i v e   yet simpler and less troublesome measures. one adage characterizing this situation i s :   k i l l i n g a f l y with an elephant gun.  
   the moral: don't chose an expensive plan  in time  money  physical suffering  etc.  when a cheaper  equally effective plan is available. 
   in this case  plastic surgery is used to eliminate serious f a c i a l conditions and involves great discomfort. since the goal is minor  t h i s plan is inappropriate. as morris notices that an expected  
more reasonable  plan was not chosen  various planning metrics  dyer 1a  are analyzed  including the cost of the plan  the goal it normally serves  etc. associated with various planning errors are larger thematic structures  taus   which generate more expectations concerning plan outcomes  and carry planning advice. once a tad associated with t h i s plan error is recognized  morris w i l l express the tau in terms of the  elephant gun  adage  and be reminded of any other story which involves the same kind of planning   o v e r k i l l   . 
   morris is currently under design at ucla  using the insights gained from experience with boris at yale. many representation and process issues remain which are best resolved through experimentat i o n with i n i t i a l implementations. morris w i l l be given an episodic memory of different stories  each indexed in terms of d i s t i n c t taus  along with v a r i ous planning metrics. whenever a plan  goal  aff e c t   or interpersonal expectation is violated  associated taus w i l l be activated  and these structures w i l l determine how the story is to be i n dexed. research is also underway for building a generator to produce appropriate adages  and thus

act as an advice giver in various planning situations. 
e. 	summary 
   one important type of story is memorable for the abstract planning advice it contains. i h i s abstract planning advice serves as a major indexing structure for both storing and retrieving stories from long-term episodic memory. the most general forms of abstract planning advice are often expressed in terms of common sayings  or adages  which refer to the moral  or point  of the story. when similar planning errors occur  the same planning analysis leads to both recall of associated adages  and to spontaneous remindings of stories which are related at the same abstract thematic l e v e l . thus planning information becomes available for both advice-giving  and the anticipation  avoidance  or recovery of future planning errors.
