introduction 
　　　in t h i s paper we describe an e f f i c i e n t way of b u i l d i n g a polyhedral approximation of a set of point on a surface in 1-d space obtained by a laser range f i n d e r . the algorithm is a generalization of an 
e x i s t i n g algorithm f o r polygonal approximation of a curve in 1d space c i   . f i r s t we recast algorithm  in the s e t t i n g of graph theory which allows us to generalize it to 1-d. second we b r i e f l y explain how the surface graph which is the basis of the present algorithm can be obtained experimentally. third we describe the main components of our algorithm. 
description of the two-dimensional 	algorithm 
     we w i l l describe the planar algorithm for d i s crete simple closed curves in the sense of  '1. let .ai i = 1   . . .   n be a set of points forming a curve c on a d i s c r e t e g r i d . for reasons which w i l l become evident l a t e r we w i l l not assume that these points are ordered along the curve  that is that a i - 1 and a-j-i   a l l indexes are taken modulo n  are the two neighbors of aj. nonetheless we assume that the s t r u c t u r e of the set of points a j is given to us as a graph g= v a  where the set of vertexes v is the set of points aj and a the set of edges. a is a subset of v*v i n d i c a t i n g neighboring vertexes that is to say neighbors on the curve. 
the planar algorithm then goes as follows : 
algorithm 1 : 
i  pick any two points p and q on c which are 
not neighbors. the l i n e pq is the zero order approximation of the curve c. i i   f i n d the shortest path from p to q in g. this separates the curve i n t o two curves c1 and c1 and the graph g i n t o two disconnected subgraphs g1 and go. 
i i i   process g1 and g1 independently : f i n d 
the most d i s t a n t point pi on cj to the l i n e pq   i = l   1   . the polygon pp1qp1 is the f i r s t order approximation to the curve c. iv  we then r e c u r s i v e l y s p l i t the curves c j in 
two by f i n d i n g the shortest path in gj from a to pi and i t e r a t i n g step i i i   on the corresponding subgraphs u n t i l s we reach an acceptable e r r o r l e v e l . 
in practice of course the need to f i n d shortest paths between vertices in a graph can be avoided in the planar case by the f a c t that points on a curve can be ordered as a sequence of neighbors. this unfortunately is not true in higher dimensions and t h i s is why we have cast the well known algorithm 1 i n t o a more general s e t t i n g which in return w i l l allow us to generalize it in a straightforward manner to the case of surfaces. 
description of the three-dimensional 	algorithm 
     these discrete surfaces have been obtained by scanning real objects whithout holes   i n our case i n d u s t r i a l parts  with a laser range finder b u i l t at inria. the object being positioned in f r o n t of the a c q u i s i t i o n system  we   r a s t e r scan  the corresponding view by moving a laser beam from top to bottom and l e f t to r i g h t of the object. the posit i o n in space of the laser spot is computed by t r i a n g u l a t i o n . the laser range finder system is described elsewere   1   . 
right now we have an accuracy of .1mm at distance of 1m f o r a depth of f i e l d of 1cm and make a measurement every 1ms. we then rotate the object in a c o n t r o l l e d manner to  see  a l l of i t . this provides us with a set of points a j   i = 1   . . .   n   in 1-d space every point having a number of neighbours. some processing has to take place to obtain t h i s information for a l l points in every view. this is 
described 	elsewhere 	. 
we are now able to b u i l d from the set of points 
a i and t h e i r neighbors the corresponding graph g= v a  as in the planar case. 
from there we can design an algorithm which is almost the same algorithm 1 and which  almost  works : 
a1gorithm 1 : 
　　　i  pick three points p q and r on the surface s which are not neighbors. 
the plane pqr is the zero order approximation of the surface s. i i   f i n d the shortest most planar cycle 
through pqr. this forms a cycle in the graph g which we denote by  pqr . this cycle separates the surface into two surfaces s1 and s1 and the graph g i n t o two disconnected subgraphs s1 and go  we a r b i t r a r i l y associate the points of pqr  e i t h e r to g1 or to g1 . i i i   process g1 and g1 independently : f i n d the most d i s t a n t point pi of si to the plane pqr   i - 1   1   . 
the polyhedron 	 pp1q qp1r rpip pp1q qp1r rpop  	is the f i r s t order approximation of the surface s. i v   we then r e c u r s i v e l y s p l i t the surfaces
