i he purpose of this paper is to discuss and compare two types of methods for reasoning with inconsistent belief bases coherence based approaches to non monolonic entailment based on the selection and management of consistent subbascs and argumentation systems based on the construction and selection of arguments in favor of a conclusion we present several argumentation systems then we show that most of the associated inference relations can be also defined using well known principles for selecting consistent subbases so we establish a formal correspondence between the so-called argumentation paradigm and recent work on nonmonotonic entailment lastly we propose several directions for further research concerning the integrauon of preference relations into argumentation systems 
1 introduction 
reasoning from inconsistent beliefs is a significant problem in artificial intelligence in this paper belief bases are considered  syntactically  as in  nebel 1  each belief is a distinct piece of information and only beliefs which are explicitely present in the base are taken into account it departs from the logical point of view where a base is identified with the set of its models our purpose is to compare two main types of approaches lo reasoning from inconsistency 
     the approaches based on the notion of maximal consistent subbase1 where non monotonic inference relations are defined by the combination of a mechanism for generating  preferred  belief subbascs a principle for selecting some of these subbases and the classical inference  sec  cavrol and lagasquie-schiex  1  for a thorough presentation of these inference relations  as preferred subbases all the maximal consistent subbases may be considered or the consistent subbases ot maximal cardinality  benferhat et al 1a  other meamngs of  preferred'' have been studied induced by the presence of an ordering on the belief base  brewka 1  geffner 1

 maximal for set inclusion consistent subbases were 
first introduced by rescher and manor 1  
and lorn 1  for a taxonomy of selection principle;.  we usually find the existential one selecting one of the preferred subbases or the universal one selecting alt the preferred subbases an intermediary pnnciple called argumentative in  benferhat et al 1b  leads lo the following consequence relations  i conclude 1 from the belief base if al least one preferred subbase classically entails $ and no preferred subbase classically entails -      
　- independently argument based approaches to defeasible reasoning have been developed  lin and shoham 1 vreeswijk 1 pollock 1 stman and i x u i 1 
dung 1 bvang goransson et al 1a & 1b hunter 1  argumentation is a general principle based on the construction and use of arguments  n argumentation system is defined by specifying the way of constructing and using arguments the basic idea is lo view reasoning as a process of first constructing arguments in favor of a conclusion and then selecting the most acceptable of them in ouier words a statement will be inferred if the arguments supporting tins statement can be successfully defended against the arguments supporting the opposite statement 
   as recently discussed in  benferhat et al 1  these two types of approaches correspond lo two attitudes in iroot of inconsistent beliefs one attitude is lo restore coherence by selecting consistent subbases the other one is to accept 
inconsistency by providing arguments for each conclusion 
　in this paper we establish a close correspondence between these two models of reasoning referred lo as coherence basedreasoimigandargument-basedreasorung in the following fust we present and discuss two completely formalized argumentation systems then we show thai the associated inference relations can be exactly restated in the framework of coherence based entairment with an appropriate selection pnnciple on maxima  consistent subbases finally we propose directions for further research concerning the integration of preference relations in argumentation systems results are given without proofs due lo space limitations proof s appear in  cayrol 1s

　more works need to be done to integrate preference ordering between arguments into argumentation systems particularly as regards the definition of consequence relations more precisely the following points deserve consideration 
     comparison of arguments in favor of the same conclusion given a priority relation on the belief base we need appropriate aggregation modes to define a preference relation on the different supports of a statement this kind of preference should respect the minimality for set inclusion see  cayrol et al 1  for preliminary work on the subject 
　　comparison of arguments for contradictory conclusions a preference relation between  conflicting'1 arguments may lead to a new definition of the relation  defeats   siman and loui 1  jeffner 1  for instance the argument  hi hi   defeats   h1 h1  iff there exists a subargumenl of  he h1  in disagreement with but less preferred than  hi hi  thus a new argumentation system is obtained in which the construction of acceptability classes and associated consequence relations can be performed a preference between conflicting arguments may be also direct!  used to define a consequence relation such as 1 is inferred if there exists an argument concluding 1 which is preferred to each argument concluding 1 i his definition was proposed in the framework of possibilistic logic b  
 benferhalefa/ 1b  definition of new acceptability classes given an 
argumentation system for instance  'xr 'e   undercuts   we may consider the arguments which are never  rebutted   resp  undercut   b  a preferred argument once again new acceptability classes will induce  a prion  new consequence relations 
　besides much work hai been devoted to die integration ol preference relations into non-monolonic inference sthemas  see  cayrol and lngasquie-schiex 1  for a survey  when the belief base is equipped with a pre ordering  namely a priority relation  a selecnon principle  universal existential or argumentative  is coupled with a mechanism ol generation of preferred subbases these generation mechanisms usually respect maximality for set

inclusion and select preferred subbases among the theses for instance inclusion-based preference combines priorities and maxima  consistent subbases while lexicographic preference benferhatef al 1a  combines pronties and consistent subbases of maximal cardinality as in the case of a flat belief base it will be interesting to establish connections between the various inference schemas developed in the framework of argumentation systems with preference and the inference relations defined through selections principles of preferred theses we are currently working on this topic
