	1. 	introduction 
　　the essential ingredients of the physics of visual perception are l i g h t sources   objects to be viewed  and the viewer  eye and camera . 
elaborating on t h i s system we can relate brightness in an image to various imaging factors including incident i l l u m i n a t i o n   object range  surface reflectance and o r i e n t a t i o n   camera focal length  e t c . 
　　in a dynamic imaging s i t u a t i o n imaging factors vary over time. this is usually the r e s u l t of the motion of objects  viewers  or l i g h t sources. all else being equal  these motions induce the corresponding motions of their projections on the imaging plane. optic flow is the apparent motion of image features in the imaging plane and can be represented as a vector f i e l d in that plane. the computation of t h i s flow f i e l d is a f i r s t step in determining the particular motions of l i g h t i n g   objects  and viewers in an image sequence. 
　　current methods for computing optic flow f a l l into two categories. the f i r s t   feature matching  involves detecting features in image frames and matching them in successive frames   1   1   1   . the second method attempts to  sense  optic flow d i r e c t l y from  the dynamic image data   1   1   1   . this method has also been seen to have two stages   1   1   1   1   . in the f i r s t stage the component of optic flow perpendicular to an edge  or p a r a l l e l to the image gradient  is measured l o c a l l y . these vectors w i l l be called optic flow cues. in the second stage the mutual constraints of optic flow cues are used to compute the true optic flow. this paper presents new approaches to both of these stages. 
1. computing 	optic 	flow 	cues 
1 image 	gradient 	methods 
　　fennema and thompson  and horn and schunck derive a computation for optic flow cues based on the assumption of constant brightness   i n time  of an o b j e c t ' s image   1   1   . if the dynamic image is represented as a scalar f i e l d i   x   y   t     then they give the magnitude of the component of optic flow in the d i r e c t i o n of the  1-d  brightness gradient 
  i x   i y   	as 

where   i x   i y i t   is the gradient of i   x   y   t   . this computation also assumes that the brightness is smoothly varying in x and y. this requirement is violated when the local detection window contains any one of the f o l l o w i n g : 
1  an occlusion boundary between objects with d i f f e r e n t v e l o c i t i e s 
1  a 	shadow 	boundary 	with 	a 	v e l o c i t y d i f f e r e n t 	from 	that 	of 	the 	shadowed object 
1  a specular r e f l e c t i o n   h i g h l i g h t   	on 	an object moving r e l a t i v e to that object 
	all of these cases 	involve 	moving 	boundaries. 
it is proposed here that the detection of the motion cues at these boundaries must be computed with respect to some edge operator. 1d~edge operators are interesting in that they provide both the edge and the motion cue information.

	in a dynamic imaging situation we have an 	image 
i x y t  with objects that can move  spin  shrink  expand  and deform  translate  rotate  scale  etc.  relative to the camera. discontinuities in i x y t  can be viewed as two-dimensional surfaces swept out by the edges in successive time-slices of i x y t . these 1d-edges contain information about both the location of 1d-edges in a single frame and 
the velocity of these edges. 
1 moving 1d-edges as 1d-edges 
   a small local piece of a 1d-edge is essentially linear and a small local piece of a 1d-edge is essentially planar. hereafter  1d-edge  and  1d-edge  will refer specifically to these small local pieces. a 1d-edge is the intersection of a 1d-edge with an xy plane  a plane of constant t  . conversely  successive occurrences of a 1d-edge sweep out a 1d-edge. the direction  orientation  of the 1d-edge in the xy plane and its velocity 
determine the orientation of the 1d-edge. 
   let 	a 	1d-edge e be 	represented 	in 	polar coordinates 	 p g  	as 	in 	fig. 1. 	in 	the 	xyt coordinate system 	this 	normal 	form 	defines 	the 
 static  unit vectors u1 -  cos 1   sin 1   1  and u1 =  sin 1   -cos 1   1  in the xy plane which are perpendicular and parallel to e respectively. 

figure 1 : normal form representaion of edges he edge e has the normal form of the line on which it lies  viz.  p    where p is the length of the perpendicular dropped to the origin and   is the angle in radians between that perpendicular and the x axis. 
	let 	the 	velocity 	of e 	be 	the 	vector 
v =  v x .v y .l  = d/dt x y t . the 1d-edge p swept out by e moving with velocity v is parallel to the vectors u  and v  see fig. 1 . thus it is perpendicular to their cross product 
w = v x u1 r  cos g   sin     -vx*cos    -vy*sin 1   . 
this vector defines the orientation of jp. note that the t component of w is - v u1 . the inner product  v u-|  is the length of the projection of v onto u1 . 


figure 1  : the local ambigui ty of a moving edge 
the 1d edge e is shown moving with velocity v. let u1 be the unit vector perpendicular to e. only the component of v parallel to u1  
 call it ve  can be detected. we have that ve =  v u1  u1 

this is the magnitude of the component of the velocity of the 1d-edge perpendicular to that edge. 
   the component of velocity parallel to the 1d edge cannot be computed from the 1d edge. this local ambiguity in the detection of optic flow can be demonstrated geometrically in the xy plane  see fig. 1 from  . 
   the geometric interpretation of local ambiguity in three dimensional xyt space is seen in the fact that the locus of velocity vectors v that would generate jp  along with a given u1  is the intersection of p with the plane t = 1 . this is a line of solutions so one degree of freedom remains to be specified .

	1. computing 	optic 	flow 
1 	the v e l o c i t y vector as a pseudo-intersection 
　　an optic flow cue provides only one component ve of 	the 	v e l o c i t y v 	of 	a 	1d-edge. 	the 	actual v e l o c i t y can l i e anywhere on the l i n e 	in 	v e l o c i t y space 	which 	has 	ve 	as 	i t s 	base 	vector 	 see fig. ha  . 	this l i n e w i l l be 	called 	the 	v e l o c i t y l i n e of ve. 	if we have two non-parallel optic flow cues ve1 and ve1 for the same 	actual 	optic 	flow  then 	the 	intersection 	of 	their 	v e l o c i t y 	l i n e s yields a unique solution for 	the 	actual 	v e l o c i t y 
  f i g . 1b  . 
　　when more than two cues are given for 	a 	single v e l o c i t y   	the v e l o c i t y l i n e s form a bundle through the 	actual 	v e l o c i t y 	p o i n t . 	in 	practical applications 	these 	l i n e s 	cannot 	be 	expected to intersect 	at 	a 	unique 	p o i n t . 	imaging 	e r r o r s   discrete 	sampling  	various 	noise 	sources  	e t c .

introduce alterations in the data and produce errorful measurements of the various vei. given the measured velocity lines we can look for the point in velocity space that best   f i t s   these lines. this is the dual problem to that of best fitting a set of points by a line. as in that problem  there are different ways of specifying what is  best . such measures are typically some function of the distances between the point s  and the line s . we have used the least square error  lse  as the goodness-of-fi t measure in our experiments. it reflects a standard intuitive definition of  best f i t   and is easy to compute. the solution for the lse error f i t of a point to a set of lines in a plane is given in . this point is called the pseud o- inter section of the given set of lines. fig. 1c presents an example of the pseudo-intersection of a set of velocity lines. 
an application of the pseudo-intersection method 
 pim  to optic flow cues in an image plane is shown in fig. 1. the first of two a r t i f i c i a l l y generated images of a sphere is shown in 1 a . in the second frame  not shown  the sphere is translated one pixel to the right. the initial optic flow cues computed from  1  are shown in 1 b . in 1 c  we see the result of taking the pseudo-intersection of the velocity lines in al 1 by 1 neighborhoods. 
   successful computation of optic flow as the pseudo-intersection of velocity lines depends on those lines being derived from a single velocity. if optic flow cues from other velocities are introduced to the computation  the pseudo-intersection is moved towards those velocities and the lse error increases. this condition may be detected by its high error  but the offending cues cannot be isolated by the 
methods discussed so far. 
　　the crux of the problem is the need to partition optic flow cues into sets whose members are all derived from the same velocity. in the plane of velocities an equivalent problem can be formulated. there we want to partition the velocity lines into bundles. in the ideal case of errorless optic flow cues and exact velocity lines this problem is easy to solve. in the practical case we must look for good pseudo-bundles  i.e. sets of lines and their pseudo-intersections having low f i t t i n g errors. a solution to this problem has been worked out by kender  who was looking for the vanishing points of texture patterns in 1d images. 
1- 	discussion  conclusions  and future directions 
   new approaches have been presented here for the detection of optic flow cues and the computation of optic flow from these cues. these two stages operate independently and so can be integrated with the alternative methods of prager  fennema and thompson  marr  or horn . 
   the need for detection of moving edges is pointed out and the computation of optic flow at these edges from 1d-edges in xyt space is derived. a single step  non-iterative  local procedure is given for computing the optic flow for a set of optic flow cues.
