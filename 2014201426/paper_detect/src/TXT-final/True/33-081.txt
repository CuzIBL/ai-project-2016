 
　　　this paper describes a system which translates a query in italian language into a representation which can be immediately interpreted as a sequence of algebraic operations on a relational data base. the use of a lookshead buffer allows the system to operate deterministically. different knowledge sources are used to cope with semantics  associated with the lexicon  and syntax  represented as pajt tern-action rules . these knowledge sources cooper ate during the query translation so that independent translation steps and intermediate representations of the command are avoided. therefore the term  determinism  is used to mean that a l l the structures built during the process concur to build the f i n a l command representation. 
introduction 
　　　one of the most popular new ideas in the f i e l d of natural language processing is the  determinism  introduced by marcus / 1 / . the system presented in this paper accepts marcus' proposals for the synta♀ tic analysis of the text  but extends that analysis to a real translation of an input query in italian language by means of a more semantical structure of the actions associated to the pattern-action synta♀ tic rules. these actions have the purpose of build ing representations of the constituents with which the syntactic rule is associated  in a form which allows the system to perform semantic checks by us ing the semantic information available from the lexicon. 
　　　one of the main features of the system is a co operation between declarative  lexicon and pattern part of the syntactic rules  and procedural  proce dures to perform semantic checks and the action part of the syntactic rules  knowledge sources such that the control flow is automatically transferred from 
one knowledge source to another without the inter vention of a central controller. 
　　　as a benchmark  the system has been specialized to act as an interface to a medical consultation program for the analysis of the liver functional assessment / 1 / . 
command representation 
　　　the interpretation process translates the in put command into a set of frame instantiations linlc ed together. by  frame  we mean a collection of slots  each of which has a name  may contain a val 
ue and may be associated with a procedure which checks the semantic correctness of the value insert ed into the slot by the grammar rules. 
the system contains a set of prototype frames 
 currently 1: actionfr  commandfr  restrictionfr  conceptfr  which are instantiated under request of the grammar rules. notice that the checks associated with the slot of a given fraae f may operate on data not necessarily stored in f  but in other frames coil nee ted to f. the check procedure associated with a frame slot is executed when the slot is f i l l e d : it 
may happen that  at that time  some of the slots  in the same frame or not  needed to perform the checks are s t i l l empty. in this case the procedure is suspended and its suspension point is stored in a l i s t together with information which allows the procedures associated with slot f i l l i n g and frame linking to resume its execution as soon as possible. 
lexicon 
　　　the lexicon contains noise words  non-content words  e.g. prepositions  and content words. the latter are used to build the final representation of the command and the information associated with them concerns their syntactic category and  for some of them  semantic information stored as links to other content words / 1 /   so that the lexicon may 
be considered as a network which allows the system to verify the semantic correctness of the command. a spelling correction is performed to detect and correct possible typing errors. 
　　　a more detailed description of the lexical knowledge source is reported in / 1 / . 
syntax 
1 　　　the syntactic knowledge is represented by means of syntactic rule packets  srp  each of which 	coit tains a set of pattern-action rules which 	specify the different forms a particular constituent may as sume. the pattern part of the rules allows the 	sy♀ tem to deterministically identify the rule 	of 	the 
packet which has to be applied to analyze the input. the pattern consists in a sequence of syntactic cat egories or constituents which have to be matched on the lookahead buffer  which is f i l l e d under request of the syntactic knowledge  cat statements; see be low  with the exact portion of input string needed to discriminate among the rules of the packet. for the sake of efficiency  the set of patterns concern ing the same srp have been represented by means of 
a discriminant net which guides the f i l l i n g 	of the buffer. 
　　　the action part of the rules is a procedure in volving imperative statements: 
- fill. it f i l l s a slot of a frame and triggers the checks associated with that slot. 
- create. it builds a new instantiation of a frame. 
- link. it connects aframe instantiation to a slot of another one. 
- cat. it checks the category of the current word of the lookahead buffer. if a l l the elements in the buffer have already been scanned  a new word is transferred into it from the input string. ill 
cidentally  the categories used in the grammar  and the constituents as well  are not the classi cal categories  noun  adjective  etc.  but are more semanticslly biased  concept  property  etc . 
- push. it involves the triggering of the srp asso ciated with the embedded constituent that has to be analyzed and the transfer of control to the srp handler. 
- del. it deletes a word from the buffer. 
　　　when a fill or link operations is executed the l i s t of suspended checks is scanned to decide wheth 
er some of them may be resumed. after the completion of the action part of a rule  the control is returti ed to the action which activated the srp containing the rule whose action has been completed. 
　　　as an example of syntactic rule packet  consid er the constituent element: it refers to a group of objects defined by a concept name  e.g. patient  followed by the conditions selecting the indiviid uals that should belong to the group  or  in case the group is restricted to a single individual  by its name  identifier . the structure of the srp is 
as follows: 

the symbol + r e f e r s to the c u r r e n t frame i n s t a n t i a t i o n   i n t h i s case a copy of conceptfr   whereas the symbol & means that the f i l l e r of the s l o t is not e x p l i c i t l y present in the input sentence; in t h i s example a l l the s l o t s c o n t a i n i n g & w i l l be f i l l e d by the semantic check procedure associated 
w i t h the s l o t val  by inspecting the semantic i n f o r mation stored in the l e x i c a l e n t r y corresponding to the c u r r e n t i d e n t i f i e r . as regards relem  it is a 
v a r i a b l e which is f i l l e d by the create o p e r a t i o n w i t h the a c t u a l name of the newly created i n s t a n t i ♀ t i o n . 
       it may be observed t h a t   in t h i s case  the dis c r i m i n a n t net is very simple because only one word has to be examined in order to determine which r u l e has to be a p p l i e d . in the groupspec d i s c r i m i n a n t net it is apparent t h a t two or three lookahead words are needed to d e t e r m i n i s t i c a l l y decide what r u l e has to be a p p l i e d ; f o r t h i s reason the lookahead b u f f e r size is not f i x e d   even if our grammar never r e quires more than four c e l l s . 

notice that the t r v e l l i n g on the d i s c r i m i n a n t net does not imply t h a t an input word is consumed   f o r example  the f i r s t word in the pushed groupspec is the same concept tested by element . 
examples and comments 
       one of the most important f e a t u r e s of the sys tem is i t s a b i l i t y to o b t a i n the same representa t i o n for sentences which have the same meaning but completely d i f f e r e n t surface s t r u c t u r e s . consider f o r example the sentences: 
s1  dammi il v a l o r e d e l l a b i l i r u b i n a t o t a l e per i p a z i e n t i con i t t e r o  give me the value of t o t a l b i l i r u b i n f o r the p a t i e n t s w i t h j a u n d i c e   . 
s1  per 	i p a z i e n t i che hanno i t t e r o dimmi quanto va le la b i l i r u b i n a t o t a l e 	 for the p a t i e n t s 	who have jaundice t e l l me what the t o t a l b i l i r u b i n i s   . 
s1  quanto hanno di b i l i r u b i n a t o t a l e i p a z i e n t i con i t t e r o presente   how much t o t a l b i l i r u b i n have the p a t i e n t s w i t h jaundice p r e s e n t     . for a l l of them the f i n a l r e p r e s e n t a t i o n is the same and is reported in f i g . 1 . 
       it should be pointed out that i n f o r m a t i o n which is i m p l i c i t in the input command has been made e x p l i c i t   e . g . in restr1 the f a c t that   j a u n d i c e   is the  name  of the symptom and in restr1 that the   v a l u e   of the jaundice used f o r p a t i e n t s e l e c t i o n should be   p r e s e n t     even if in the sen tences s1 and s1 it is understood . 
       the r e s u l t i n g r e p r e s e n t a t i o n may seem r a t h e r awkward. for example  it may not be apparent why restr1 is linked to an a c t i o n  named show  instead

of the concept it qualifies  jaundice . the advan cage of this representation is the one-to-one na♀ ping between the pointers which link the frames and the algebraic operators of the relational approach to database construction. for example  each pointer to a restriction implies a select operation on the relation to which the concept  or the action  is associated  each pointer connecting an action and a concept implies a join operation on the two involv ed relations and so on. 
　　　it is worth noticing the difference between the representation of the sentence si   f i g . l   and the representation  fig.1  of the sentence: 
s1  dammi il valore della bilirubina totale per i pa sienti di sesso meschile  give me the value of total b i l i r u b i n for the patients of male sex . the difference is due to the fact that  sex  is a property of a patient and for this reason it is stored in the data base relation patient  whereas  jaundice  is an identifier of the concept  symptom    i . e . a key of the data base relation symptom   so that the value of jaundice for a given patient is stored in the connection relation named show. 
　　　in f i g . l and 1 the frame structure was heavily simplified for the sake of r e a d i b i l i t y ; let us con sider as an example the actual structure of restric tionfr: 
restrictionfr  feature  op  val  feature!  op!  vax!  back  restrchain  
the slots composing the frame are of three kinds: 
external  internal  link; the external slots  e.g. feature  op  val  contain the actual lexical entries appearing in the input sentence; the internal ones  e.g. feature!  op!  val!  concern the correspond ing internal representation  which w i l l be used to  
access the data atored in the data base relations; the link slots  e.g. rack  restrchain  contain the pointers to other instantiations. 
　　　in restrictionfr the slot feature contains the name of the attribute used to perform the selection  whereas the slots op and val contain the operator and the linguistic or numeric value involved in the select operation. when the string  di sesso raaschi le  in the sentence sa is analysed  the slots fea ture and val are f i l l e d with  sesso  and  meschile  respectively  whereas the slot op is f i l l e d with & 
 undefined . the semantic checks associated 	with 
feature end val provide not only the f i l l i n g of fea ture! end val! with the internal representation of  sesso  and  meschile    i . e . sex and male  but also the f i l l i n g of op! with eq  the choice of eq depends 
on the information associated with  maschile   thus leading to the situation of restr1 shown in f i g . 1 . 
　　　the slot back contains a backward pointer 	to the conceptfr  or actionfr  instantiation for which the restrictionfr instantiation acts as a condition. finally  the slot restrchain may contain a pointer to another instantiation of restrictionfr which acts 
as a further condition for the selection   i . e . the two - or more - conditions are anded . 
　　　the system has been implemented in lisp on a dec-1; the lexical and syntactic processes have been tested f u l l y   wherees the procedures associat ed with the semantic checks are currently under debug.
