are known in t h i s special s i t u a t i o n .

　　　although o p t i c a l flows were shown to be a r i c h source of information  t h e i r detection poses a problem: in general  it is d i f f i c u l t to obtain image v e l o c i t i e s d i r e c t l y from image brightness. here we investigate a special s i t u a t i o n where r e s t r i c t i n g

　　　in pure translation  the image elements on the projection plane  pp  move a l l along straight lines determined only by the position of the image points on pp and the focus of expansion  foe   the unique point of intersection of all these straight lines   foe corresponds to the point where the vector along which the observer translates pierces the pp. in the case of pure translation the directions of the image velocities are independent of the surface layout; the information about the spatial disposition of the texture elements is contained only in the magnitudes of the image motions. because each image element moves along a known straight line on pp  the problem reduces to estimating the motion of a one dimensional brightness distribution along the line  it is assumed here that the distribution does not change significantly from frame to frame . this problem is easily solvable. using the taylor series expansion one can develop an expression for the image displacement a♀ relating the temporal and spatial derivative of the image brightness function along the line it at a given image point  see e.g.  . 

where i is the image brightness function  and a♀ is its displacement at an image point along the line i. with a sufficiently small interframe in-
terval   if one disregards the components of order 1 and higher  this approxi-
mation reduces to a linear approximation used e.g. in   1   . observe that the linear approximation is appropriate only at points where the f i r s t spatial derivative along l is  approxi-
mately  constant and the displacement remains with-

where q is the distance of the image element on pp from the center of projection  and  is the angle between the line l on pp and the projection ray  figure 1 . q and  are constants for a given foe and reflect the fact that the projection surface is a plane which is not isotropic with respect to the image velocities. the above equations enable one to compute the relative depth directly. the derivatives dl/dt  and dl/dil have to be estimated from a succession of digital images. the derivative  can be approximated directly from successive  temporally proximal  digital images. the derivative dl/dl of i along l is easily obtainable from neighboring gray level values by interpolation. one has to assure the existence of both derivatives at locations where b is to be
