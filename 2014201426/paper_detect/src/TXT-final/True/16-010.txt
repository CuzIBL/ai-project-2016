a. 	introduction 
       it 	is often argued that al 	- 	including nls are ready to be applied while at the same time business and 	industry are ready to apply them. the 
o p t i m i s t i c view is supported mainly by three p o i n t s : 
  the examples of successful systems l i k e intellect and r l ; 
  the i n t e r e s t of industry in al p u b l i c a t i o n s and al conferences  as shown by the increasing number of p a r t i c i p a n t s coming from industry  ecai-1 ; 
  the increasing consulting a c t i v i t i e s of al corpor a t i o n s   mainly in the us. 
       the pessimistic view is supported by those who  in p o i n t i n g out unsolved problems  warn al researchers not to engender i l l u s i o n s   which are nece s s a r i l y followed by disappointment  and not to neglect work on t h e o r e t i c a l foundations  aaai-1 . a t h i r d point of view comes from outside of a l : studies in the f i e l d of human factors attempt to prove that s t r i c t software engineering is superior to al techniques  e . g . that natural language is i n appropriate for man-machine-interact ion. i shall not enter into t h i s debate here. what seems to be lacking is a sound basis for discussion. that is 
  empirical 	data about the demand for a v a i l a b l e al products 
  empirical data about the need for  perhaps not yet developed  al products 
  empirical data about those features that customers r e q u i r e . 
       guided by these considerations  the ham-ans p r o j e c t performed a market inquiry in the f i e l d of german nls. this paper presents some of the f i n d ings. 
b. 	methodological questions 
       of course  there are several methodological questions connected w i t h t h i s market i n q u i r y . f i r s t   it is a hypothetical i n q u i r y   i . e . an i n quiry about a product type that is not yet a v a i l a ble on the german market. during the pretest we discovered that some people did not believe that nls are even p o s s i b l e . second  it is an inquiry about a new product type  i . e . not concerning a p a r t i c u l a r   completed nls but nls  as such . t h i r d   it is not a user study but a market i n q u i r y   i . e . the interviewees are p o t e n t i a l customers and not the intended users  although they are highly affected by a buying d e c i s i o n . the reactions of the users  acceptance or not  are an important basis for the decision of the customers. fourth  no 
awareness of 	l i n g u i s t i c or conceptual 	f a c i l i t i e s could be expected from the interviewees. during the pretest we t r i e d out some methods for c o l l e c t ing the most demanded f a c i l i t i e s of a nls. we 
found out 	that most of the p o t e n t i a l 	customers were not 	interested 	in these d e t a i l s   how ever they were presented. perhaps  the 	intended users 
a r e   but t h i s was not a user study. as one i n t e r viewee put 	i t : 	  w e ' l l 	buy the best system a v a i l a b l e . 	but 	it 	is your task to f i n d out which system is the b e s t .   so  we could only f i n d out 
  what 	is viewed as a benefit of nls  what 	is considered a disadvantage  and how the costs are 
assessed; 
  in which ways p o t e n t i a l customers believe the users to be a f f e c t e d ; 
  whether p o t e n t i a l customers believe that they would invest in nls  if they were a v a i l a b l e now; 
  in which s e t t i n g and for what 	tasks p o t e n t i a l customers would 	l i k e to apply a nls. 
       from the analysis of the a p p l i c a t i o n areas where nls are desired some demands on nls c a p a b i l i t i e s can be determined. there is yet a f i f t h methodological problem: whether to conduct a q u a l i t a t i v e or q u a n t i t a t i v e i n q u i r y . we did both.

c. results 
       from 1 questionnaires  1 were f i l l e d out and sent back. in a q u a n t i t a t i v e inquiry by mailed questionnaires  t h i s 1% r e c a l l quota is very h i g h   and r e f l e c t s the interest in al software products and the open-mindedness toward new ways of man-machi n e - i n t e r a c t i o n . 

　　　we requested only general data in the quest i o n n a i r e about nls themselves. the most important r e s u l t s are l i s t e d in the table above. i n d i r e c t l y   
however  from the analysis of the claimed a p p l i c a t i o n areas  some requirements became clear in more d e t a i l  see ' s e t t i n g and t a s k s '   . 
	1. 	cost-benefit-analysis 
       in order to determine the demand for nls we asked about t h e i r supposed b e n e f i t s   c o s t s   and the r e l a t i o n between them. we also took into account the believed e f f e c t s on the user  because t h i s may have influenced the assessment made by p o t e n t i a l customers. 1% of the interviewees  i n dependent of t h e i r p o s i t i o n   feel that a nls would be put to good use at t h e i r working place. the most frequently indicated b e n e f i t s of nls were b e t t e r substantiated decision-making  1%  and planning  1% . that more people have access to computers is viewed as b e n e f i c i a l by 1%. that the user is more in control i n t e r a c t i n g w i t h a nls  1%  and system's performance w i l l be more transparent  1%  are considered advantageous e f f e c t s on the user. we may i n f e r from t h i s the importance of an explanation component. 
       as disadvantage for the user the increase of workload because of using nls is noted by only 
1% of the interviewees. 1% believe that contentment of employees does not increase w i t h the i n t r o d u c t i o n of nls  but the opposite is asserted 
by 1%. other changes in the users' work routines were denied by the m a j o r i t y . 
       a nls is expected to be expensive - l i k e any other computer system. 1% of the interviewees reported from experience that computers are expens i v e   1% supposed nls to be expensive and 1% d i d n ' t know. 1% placed the maximal p r i c e for a nls alone between 1 and 1 deutschmark. although 1% believe that the costs of a nls would be greater than the benefits in the short 
run  1% would i n v e s t   if nls were now a v a i l a b l e ! this 'act d i s p o s i t i o n ' does not depend on the trade or the p o s i t i o n of the interviewee. so  there seems to be a great demand for and p o s i t i v e a t t i t u d e t o -
wards nls. 
	1. 	setting and tasks 
　　　the desired a p p l i c a t i o n areas for nls w i l l now be i n v e s t i g a t e d   showing t h e i r implications in terms of nls c a p a b i l i t i e s . a simple model of a nls s e t t i n g was presented to the interviewee: 

       a nls was judged a useful support for f l e x i b l e   i n d i c a t e d by 1% of the interviewees  and time s e n s i t i v e working processes  1% - it is expected that the information gets into the information seeker's hands sooner w i t h the help of nls. because decision processes are often time s e n s i t i v e it is not s u r p r i s i n g that decision support is the most demanded f u n c t i o n of the o v e r a l l system for the working process. 1. 1% of the interviewees marked decision support as the prime task for a natural language interfaced system. but also information 
supply 	 1%  	and a d m i n i s t r a t i v e support 	 1%  
were named. decision support is p r i m a r i l y needed by experts who are not programmers  e . g . managers from a l l trades  d o c t o r s   chemists  e t c . but also at lower levels in a f i r m ' s hierarchy decision support is d e s i r e d . clerks may use a system not only supporting t h e i r a d m i n i s t r a t i v e work but also aiding in wel1-substantiated decision-making  e . g . to decide which o f f e r can be made w i t h respect to resources and f o l l o w - u p c h a r t s . this example  stemming from the personal i n q u i r i e s   shows the close r e l a t i o n s h i p between decision and planning. viewing gus  f o r example  as a d e c i s i o n - s u p p o r t i n g system  we are f a m i l i a r w i t h the degree of planning c a p a b i l i t i e s expected by the user  bobrow et a l . 1   . 

　　　the most frequently named user type of nls 	is the parametric user type  1% . we defined the par-
ametric user  diverging from the d e f i n i t i o n of codd  date 1 as a permanent user whose interactions w i t h the system are part of his/her j o b   regardless of whether the job is routine or not. expert users  here: occasional and p r o f e s s i o n a l l y mot i v a t e d use of the system  were indicated as t y p i cal nls users by 1. 1%  casual users  here: occasional use that does not belong to the job  by 1%. as expected  there was a strong c o r r e l a t i o n between the i n d i c a t i o n of information supply as system's f u n c t i o n and that of casual user as t y p i cal nls user type. and most people who chose 'expert user' marked decision support as the most sens i b l e system f u n c t i o n . 
　　　the choices for background system were: data base system  expert system  and planning system. information retrieval systems were excluded because t h e i r domain is t y p i c a l l y too extensive for a knowledge-based nls to handle. while image i n t e r p r e t a t i o n  1%  and planning systems {1%  were r a r e l y named  expert systems have 1% of the 
votes. yet  the most often chosen background system for a nls was a data base system  1% . but we suspect that it is not understood as a t e c h n i c a l l y s t r i c t term  o r i e n t e d toward the data base systems now a v a i l a b l e . a l l people who wanted d i r e c t access via natural language to mass data  1%  checked data base system  but nearly a t h i r d of the 1% 
who desired access to expert knowledge did so too. expert knowledge was defined as rule-based knowledge of experience in a l i m i t e d domain. in which respect could t h i s kind of knowledge appear in a 
data base context  from the personal interviews it became clear that i n f e r e n t i a l knowledge about the discourse domain and meta-knowledge about the data base is expected to be attached to the data base system. this may be taken as evidence for the thesis of tennant  1  that the ease of man-machinei n t e r a c t i o n requires the extension of conceptual 
coverage beyond the 	l i m i t s of data base contents. 
       two other c a p a b i l i t i e s of natural language i n terfaced systems suggest new d i r e c t i o n s for research. the system should not only supply informat i o n but do something according to the d i a l o g . that data may be changed of brought in in a natural language dialog was declared to be decisive by 1% of the interviewees  in the hope that the b o t t l e neck of data input may thus be overcome. as we know from the work of salveter  maier  1  and mylopoulos et a l .  1    natural language update imp l i c i t l y demands meta-knowledge about changes in the world and meta-knowledge about data base t r a n s a c t i o n s . the task  simple in the eyes of the users  t-urns out to be d i f f i c u l t for those developing the systems. another requirement for nls concerns app l i c a t i o n programs. 1% judge as decisive and 1% as useful that a p p l i c a t i o n programs may be s t a r t e d via natural language. if an advising dialog leads to a decision by the user  the system is ex-
pected to f u l f i l l the corresponding tasks. a tax advising expert system l i k e taxman ii  mccarty et a l . 1     f o r example  should f i l l in the corresponding tax form. a hotel advising system should not 
only inform the user about advantages of the hotel but also book a room and do a l l of the related 
k. morik 1 
bookkeeping  if it is ordered by the user. from the point of view of the customers it seems q u i t e natural that the tasks r e s u l t i n g from a decision supp o r t i n g dialog w i t h a computer are performed by the same system. aside from ad hoc solutions for a spec i a l a p p l i c a t i o n   the r e a l i z a t i o n of t h i s demand requi res : 
  interprocess communication   i n a master-slave mode w i t h the nls in c o n t r o l   
	t r a n s m i t t i n g 	s p e c i f i c a t i o n s of 	the user  which 
were gathered during the d i a l o g as parameters to the a p p l i c a t i o n program 
t r a n s m i t t i n g requests for missing s p e c i f i c a t i o n s to the nls  t r i g g e r i n g the generation of queries for f u r t h e r i n f o r m a t i o n ; 
  representation of provisional r e s u l t s during the d i alog ; 
  abstract 	representation of 	the 	program's a c t i o n s ; 
  representation of real world actions in r e l a t i o n to the implications of verbs   e . g . what does it imply to 'book' a room   
  understanding of 	the speech acts 	' o r d e r ' 	and

 command' 
       coming back to the debate  mentioned above  the conclusion is q u i t e balanced: there is a great demand for nls but there is also a lot of work to meet these requirements.
