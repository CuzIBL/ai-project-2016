 
in equality-based binary resolution  the v i a b i l i t y test is used as a decision mechanism to select disagreement sets and also to define the rue u n i f i e r . in this paper we solve the problem of non-termination of the v i a b i l i t y test by applying the theory of and-or graphs. 
　　rue refutations are succinct and typically less than half as long as corresponding refutations with the equality axioms. furthermore  rue resolution is complete without using paramodulation or the equality axioms. experiments with a theorem prover based on this method have produced superior results which are described in   d i g r i c o l i and harrison 1 . 

1. introduction 
in resolution by unification and equality 
 rue resolution   we augment the standard theory of binary resolution due to  robinson i1  by the notion of disagreement sets  to incorporate the axioms of equality into the d e f i n i t i o n of resolution and eliminate the use of these axioms in refutations. 
　　in rue resolution we resolve to inequalities when the mgu does not exist; for example  the e-unsatisfiable set: 
1. rue resolution 
the basic definitions underlying rue resolution are the following: 
a disagreement set of a pair of terms: 
  i f s t are non-identical terms  the set of one element  a pair    s : t     is the origin disagreement set. 
if s t have the form: f   a 1   . . .   a k     f   b 1 . . .   b k     then the set of pairs of corresponding arguments that are not identical is the topmost 

disagreement set.

　　since in rue theory  the concept of v i a b i l i t y plays a central role in defining the rue u n i f i e r and the topmost viable 
disagreement set  the p o s s i b i l i t y of nontermination undermines the theory of rue resolution in strong form unless we can show how to avoid non-termination. the 
primary subject of this paper is to show how the theory of and-or graphs due to  chang and slagle 1l  can be used to solve this problem. 
1. 	the theory of and-or graphs 
a node in an-and-qr graph represents a problem to be solved. 	we define an and-expansion: 

　　in an and-or graph we repeatedly perform decomposition u n t i l we reach primitive subproblems which are known to be solvable or unsolvable. these are the leaf nodes .of the graph. the entire graph represents a system of boolean substitutions for the root node. 
　　a set of leaf nodes  !the solution of a l l of which implies the solution of the root node  is called an implicant of the root. one implicant is said to subsume another implicant if it is a subset of that implicant. for example  if we denote 
nodes by numeric indices  then {1} subsumes {1 1} and  furthermore  since {1  is a simpler solution  we should discard {1 1}. subsumption w i l l play an important role in our work. 
1 	automated deduction 
　　the situation becomes interesting because of c i r c u l a r i t y . the and-or graph: 

has no solution due to c i r c u l a r i t y . but the cyclic and-or graph: 

has one solution: p1   p1 . 
　　an and-or graph with many nodes and cycles may represent a very complex problem decomposition. the following algorithm stated by chang and slagle w i l l compute the implicants of an arbitrary and-or graph: 
implicant algorithm; 
1. i n i t i a l i z e the current formula to the root node. 
1. select any non-leaf node in the current formula  for example  the lowest numbered node  and substitute i t s boolean expansion as stated in the and-or graph  for each occurrence of this node in the current formula. 
1. remove from the current formula any implicant which is subsumed by another implicant in the current formula or by an implicant which previously appeared in the current formula. 
1. repeat steps  1  and  1  u n t i l the current formula either vanishes  there is no solution for the root due to cycles in the graph  or only leaf nodes appear in the current formula. in the l a t t e r case  the f i n a l state of the current formula  when no further substitutions are possible  represents 
a disjunction of the alternative implicants of the and-or graph. 
for example  consider the and-or graph taken from  nilsson 1f p.1  : 

   chang and slagle prove that their algorithm always converges to solution implicants or to the empty formula  irrespective of cycles in the graph. 
nilsson who gives a good treatment of and-or graphs in   l 1 l   f a i l s to mention the implicant algorithm which seems to be 
absent from most texts in a r t i f i c i a l 
intelligence. 

so the question arises: is this inequality viable  we have previously shown that the v i a b i l i t y test does not terminate when applied to this inequality. in point of fact  this inequality is not viable since we cannot deduce f a b =d from s. 
　　the reader should review the d e f i n i tion of v i a b i l i t y and then follow the decomposition that occurs in the and-or graph which simply traces the recursive application of the v i a b i l i t y test. the and-or graph contains no duplicate nodesj hence  in expanding node 1 we cycle back to node 1  creating a cyclic graph. a l l the c i r c u l a r i t y which occurs during the v i a b i l i t y test w i l l produce cycles in the and-or graph which are analyzed by the implicant algorithm to determine v i a b i l i t y . 
　　we impose the condition that the nodes of a v i a b i l i t y graph be mutually d i s t i n c t so that if a successor node already exists in the graph we arc back to that unique representation in the graph. the leaf nodes of a v i a b i l i t y graph w i l l necessarily be either unsolvable argument nodes  the v i a b i l i t y test is not satisfied  or solved unification nodes  a term unifies with the argument of an equality l i t e r a l   . the root inequality is viable if and only if the implicant algorithm converges to at least one implicant composed purely of solved unification nodes. in rue resolution in strong form we are required to resolve to the topmost viable disagree-
ment set  each inequality must be viable and nearest the topmost disagreement of the complementary l i t e r a l s resolved.

　　the and-or graph for the v i a b i l i t y of an inequality w i l l always be f i n i t e since the number of d i s t i n c t terms or subterms in s is f i n i t e and duplicate nodes are not permitted in the graph. 
　　we w i l l present the s t r i c t formalization of the concept of an and-or graph applied to v i a b i l i t y   defining the d i f f e r ent types of nodes present in the graph  namely  inequality nodes  argument nodes  unification nodes  function-matching nodes and disagreement set nodes  in a proximate future paper.
