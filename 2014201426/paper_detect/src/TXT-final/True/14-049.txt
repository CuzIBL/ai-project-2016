	i- 	introduction 
　　the role of damage assessment of existing structures has received increasing attention recently  1 1. existing structures refer to those already b u i l t and in existence. frequently  there exists a need to evaluate the safety and rel i a b i l i t y of a p a r t i c u l a r structure or a number of existing structures either as a part of periodic inspection program or immediately following a 
given hazardous event  1. as an example  consider the aftermath of a strong-motion earthquake in a metropolitan area. 
　　prior to construction  each structure is analyzed and designed on the basis of some mathematical formulations  which are the results of i d e a l i z a t i o n and generalizations from available knowledge and past experience. once a structure is b u i l t   it has i t s own c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s   which can no longer be precisely described by the same i n i t i a l mathematical models used in the design 
phase  1 1. more r e a l i s t i c behavior of exi s t i n g structures can be obtained during earthquakes. for this purpose  accelerometers and other instruments have been i n s t a l l e d to record the dynamic behavior of certain building structures  1. system i d e n t i f i c a t i o n techniques  1 1 and damage assessment can be employed j o i n t l y to examine the real behavior and to assess the safety state of these existing structures so that a correct decision may be reached in terms of any immediate alarm  the need of r e p a i r i n g   the predi c t i o n of future damage and the improvement of technologies for aseismic structures. 
　　the s t a t e - o f - t h e - a r t in damage assessment of existing structures is that only very small number of experienced engineers are well q u a l i f i e d to practice i t . moreover  the transfer of this com-

pfr 1. 
plex decision-making practice to younger engineers depends p r i m a r i l y on many years of close working relationship with these experienced and q u a l i f i e d 
engineers   1   . to-date  several methods of structural damage assessment have been proposed   1     and some related works on the f a i l u r e r e s i s tance evaluation or estimation of existing b u i l d ings have been reported   1   1   1   1   . however  a complete and rational solution of the damage assessment problem is not yet a v a i l a b l e . 
　　fu and yao c1 suggested that the problem of the damage assessment can be considered in terms of the theory of pattern recognition. in pattern recognition c1  when using decision-theoretic c1 or syntactic approaches   1     it requires a description of the patterns under study in terms of a certain mathematical model  which requires a f a i r l y clear or s t a t i s t i c a l knowledge about the p a t t e r n s . such complete knowledge is frequently unavailable in complex or i l l - d e f i n e d problems  or problems involving subjective human f a c t o r   such as damage assessment and medical diagnosis  1. accordingly  a recent damage assessment study  1 suggested the use of a rule-based production system to realize a highly e f f e c t i v e knowledge u t i l i z a t i o n of the structural experts and an inexact inference procedure. relation between pattern recognition and some ai approaches has been discussed in c1. 
　　this paper describes a rule-based damage assessment system of the existing structures sub-
jected to earthquake e x c i t a t i o n   called speril s t r u c t u r a l perii  . after a brief description of the relevant knowledge organization  the p r i n c i p l e of an inexact inference employed in speril is described. 
	1' 	knowledge organization 
　　structures are commonly c l a s s i f i e d according to t h e i r structural materials into following types  1 1:  a  wooden   b  masonry   c  reinforced concrete  and  d  s t e e l . during construction  certain parts of the structure can be prefabricated for economical reasons. in p a r t i c u l a r   reinforced concrete can be further c l a s s i f i e d into  c-1 poured-in-place  or i n - s i t u   reinforcedconcrete and  c-1  precast  or prestressed  reinforced-concrete. as a structure with a mixed property of reinforced concrete and steel frame   e  steel-framed reinforced-concrete structures are b u i l t in japan   1   . among these types  because wooden and masonry construction are f r e quently limited to low-rise b u i l d i n g s   we w i l l concentrate our attention on reinforced concrete

and steel structures herein. 
　　generally speaking  for high-rise s t r u c t u r e   steel frame is usually preferable because of i t s high strength  high d u c t i l i t y and uniform q u a l i t y . the construction cost of steel s t r u c t u r e   however  is frequently higher than that of reinforced conc r e t e . 
　　as the f i r s t step to the system design  define the grade of the damage state of existing structures in terms of a numerical quantity between 1 and 1  where 1 and 1 correspond to  no damage  and   t o t a l collapse   respectively. in a d d i t i o n   define the damage state in terms of verbal i n terpretation as shown in f i g . 1- this c l a s s i f i c a t i o n is not s t r i c t . however  each class is assumed to be associated with a suitable recommendat i o n and the cost for proper repair a c t i o n . 
　　now the problem is one to construct a rational decision-making system for confirming the hypothesis that the structure in question is severely damaged  to be true or f a l s e   or to be more reasonable than other hypotheses from possible observations. the observations may come from   i   visual inspection at various portions of the s t r u c t u r e     i i   reading of accelerometer records during the earthquake    i i i   nondestructive t e s t i n g   and  iv  loading tests before and after the

t i t i o n s   u t i l i t i e s   elevators  e t c . features t o be derived from the accelerometer records by using system i d e n t i f i c a t i o n techniques may include the change of natural frequency of the building v i b r a t i o n   the change of damping f a c t o r   the maximum i n t e r s t o r y d r i f t and the t o t a l energy absorption and dissipation during the earthquake.  time hist o r i e s of above changes are sometimes also good information for experts.  in a d d i t i o n   when we try to infer the damage state from above-mentioned features  we should consider many other conditions regarding the s t r u c t u r e s   such as structural mat e r i a l   height or number of s t o r i e s   areas of f l o o r s   shapes  s o i l condition and foundation  the year that the building was b u i l t   building use  design parameters if a v a i l a b l e   existence oi w a l l s   experience of human inspector  etc. which are stored as reference data apart from inspectior data and u t i l i z e d for the inference. 
　　the approach of production system  1 1 a l lows us to decompose a complex problem into a num-
ber of simpler sub-problems  the relations among which are hierarchical  parent and son  or parall e l   b r o t h e r s   . in a d d i t i o n   in order to accommo-
date knowledge e f f i c i e n t l y from human experts  these sub-problems are f i t into knowledge units of the experts. with this in mind  the framework for knowledge representation is determined and is shown in f i g . 1  where several intermediate diagnostic states are introduced. each numbered node corresponds to a set of rules in the productior system for inference. each double circled node denotes the data analysis process for obtaining the feature from the accelerometer records. 
i l l . 	production system with certainty factor 
　　before going into the description of speril's inexact inference mechanism  let us see why a direct application of existing methods is inconvenient . 
	the certainty factor was f i r s t introduced 	int  


	in the fuzzy set theory 	 1 1  	a 	mem-
bership function and i t s operations play a major role in the expression of ambiguous facts and inferences. maximum and/or minimum are fundament a l operations for the manipulation of the membership f u n c t i o n . the theory of fuzzy set could provide a convenient tool to the inference of damage assessment which is continuous in nature. moreover  recent applications of fuzzy set theory to c i v i l or s t r u c t u r a l engineering problems  1 1 1 have shown that fuzzy membership functions provide a good measure for the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of low-level features in damage assessment. 
　　consider the inference example in section i i i in terms of fuzzy set theory under the framework of production system. first of a l l   we define the where v denotes max. operation. 
　　several fuzzy sets of  gl1   for example  can be inferred in t h i s way from rule 1 1   1  1  1. according to the elementary operations of the fuzzy set theory  the f i n a l  gl1  is eventually obtained by taking the maximum membership func-
t i o n of these {gl1 s at each d. 
　　the advantages of using fuzzy set theory in t h i s application are t h a t   1  the range covered by a rule is broad  1  redundant rules are allowed because only one e f f e c t i v e element is selected through the max. and/or min. operations  and 1  the inference is realized for the continuous v a r i ables by a smart mapping calculations of fuzzy rel a t i o n s . hence  the problem described in the pre-
