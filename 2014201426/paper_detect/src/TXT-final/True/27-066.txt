1 	introduction 
in recent  ears defeasible deontic logic has become increasingly popular as a tool to model legal reasonmg in expert systems  mccart   1 mever and wiennga  1  jones and sergot 1  because defeasible re asoning is an important aspect of legal reasoning  prakken 1  deontic logic is a modal logic in which the modal operator o is used to express that something is obligatory   for example if the proposition r stands for the fact that you are robbed then  o - 1  expresses that you ought not to be robbed dyadic modal logics were introduced to formalize deontic reasoning about subideal

behavior in  for example the chisholm 'paradox that we will discuss later an example of a conditional obligation m a dyadic modal logic is 1 h | r  which expresses that you ought to be helped  h  when you are robbed  r  if both 1 -r | t  and are true then we say that the obli gation is violated by the fact r in recent years it was ar gued by several authors that these dyadic obligations can be formalized in non monotonic logics  mccarty 1  
harty 1  rvu and lee 1  
　in defeasible reasoning one  an distinguish two types of defeasibihty to illustrate the difference between the two we consider the default rule -  this default can be defeated by the fact -p  or it can be overridden by another more specific default q-f/p  for example in brcwkds prioritized elefault logic  brewka  1   ve call the first case facatual defeasibihty and the last one ovverridden de feasibility in both the se cases the default p/p is cancelled either by the fact -p or by the default rule respec tivelv by cancelation wc mean  for example  that if -p is true then the default assumption that p is true is null and void the truth of -p implies that the default assumption about p is completely  falsified to say that a fact is inconsistent with a default rule makes no sense literallv because a default rule has no truth value however if we consider tbe autoepisttmu translation  honohge 1  - i-y  -  p of the default ＊*  with the an toepisteniu belief operator l  then - l~ p a -ip is ine  insistent in other words the default assumption - ♀- p is not consistent with the fact - /  the fundamental 
difference between deontic logic and logics for defeasible reasoning is that 1{p | t  a - p i  not inconsistent that is the reason why the deonlic operator o had to be represented as a modal operator with a possible worlds semantics  to make sure that both the obligation and its violation could be true ai the sainr time  1 though the obligation 1{p | t  is violated by the fact - p  the obli gation still has its fe rce for example even if you are robbed  you should not have been robbed but if a penguin cannot fly  it makes no sense to state that normally he can fly we will refer to this relation between the obligation and its violation as overghadounng to distinguish

it from cancellation in the ca.se of defeasible logics 1 
　in this paper we defend two claims first that a number of notorious 'paradoxes of deontic logic can be solved when they are analyzed as forms of defeasible reasoning this has alread} been defended by other authors before us second } and this is a new claim we argue 
that an analogous distinction between factual dcfcasibilit  and overridden defcasibility also holds for defeasibli obligations a defeasible obligation  can be violated by a fact or overridden bv another obligation 
         however the important difference is that in the case of default logics both types of defeasibility are cancellation whereas in the case of deontic logic onl  overnding leads  to cancellation  while violation leads to overshadowing because of this difference between can ccllation in the first cast and overshadowing in the second case  it becomes essential not to confuse the two t pes of defeasibility in analyzing the 'paradoxes' we 
show that if thev are confused  counterintuitive conclusions follow for the chisholm and forrester paradoxes the distinction between these two kinds of defeasibihty is in our opinion the real paradox of defeasible deontit. logic because the  have 1% overlap but they are different this distinction will become clear when we analyze the detachment of absolute obligations from the dyadic obligations 
　this paper is organized as follows in section 1 we give a detailed comparison of factual and overridden defeasibihtv in deontit reasoning and we show that the chisholm 'paradox can better be analyzed as a case of factual defeasibility rather than overridden dcfeasibilitv  as is usually done in section 1 we focus on the overshadowmg aspect of factual defeasibility and the cancellation aspect of overridden defeasibility  and we show that in an adequate anal} sis of the forrester 'paradox both these aspects ha e to be combined in section 1 we discuss further research 
1 	overridden versus factual defeasibihty 
in this section wc give a general anal} sis of defeasible deontic logic by analyzing some intuitive inference patterns 1 we show the fundamental difference between factual and overridden defeasibihty 
1 	c o n t r a r y - t o - d u t y obligations 
deontic logic is plagued by manv 'paradoxes' intuitvely consistent sentences which are formally inconsistent or derive counterintuitive sentences the most notorious 'paradoxes' arc caused by so-called contrary-to-dut   ctd  obligations obligations that refer to subideal situations for example  lewis describes the ctd obligation that  ou ought to be helped when  ou are robbed 
example 1  good samaritan 'paradox'  'it ought not to be that you are robbed a fortiori it ought not to be that you are robbed and then helped but you ought to be helped  given that you have been robbed this robbing excludes the best possibility s that might otherwise have been actualized  and the helping is needed in order to actualize the but of those that remain among the best 
possible worlds marred by the robbing tht best of the bad lot are some of thosf where the robbing is followed by helping  lewis 1  
in the early seventies several dvadic modal systems were introduced to formalize ctd obligations sne  lcwjs 1  for an overview unfortunately several technical problems related to ctd reasoning persisted in the d adic logics see  tomberhn  1  a dyadic obligation 1 n |    can be read as 'if    the antecedent  is the case then a  the consequent  ought to be the case a ctd obligation is a dyadic obligation of which the antecedent contradicts the conclusion of another obligation for example if wc have  then the last one is a ctd  alias secondary obligation and the first one is called its primary obligation ctd obligations refer to optimal subideal situations in the subideal situation that i is violated the best thing to do is recently if was observed that the violation can be formalized in non-monotonic logics  mccarty  1 horty 1  theories of diagnosis  tan and van der 
torre 1a  1c  and decision theories  boutilier 1b  wc sa  that dyadic obligations satisfy the kantian principle 'ought implies ran when ought refers to 'the best of those that remain' this will be explained in more detail in section 1 
　since the late seventies  several temporal deontic lopes and deontic action logics were introduced  eg  loewer and belzer  1  makinson  1 alchourron  1  which formalize sat isfact only a special type of ctd obligations temporal deontic logics formalize conditional obligations in which the consequent occurs later than the antecedent the underlying principle of the formalization of ctd obligations is that facts of the past are not in the 'context of judgment'  loewer and belzer 1  hence they can formalize the good samaritan 'paradox in example 1 however  they cannot formalize the variant of the 'paradox' described by forrester  see example 1  and the chisholm 'paradox'  see example 1   because in these 'paradoxes' there arc ctd obligations of which the consequent occurs at the same time or even before its antecedent 
1 	o v e r r i d d e n defeasibility 
a defeasible deontic logic can formalize obligations that ran be overridden hy other obligations overridden structures can be based on a notion of specificity  like in horty s well-known example that vou should not eat with your fingers  but if you are served asparagus you should cat with your fingers  hortv 1  we say that an obligation is cancelled by exceptional circumstances when it is overridden for example the obligation not to cat with your fingers is cancelled bv the exceptional circumstances that vou are served asparagus 
　in a defeasible deontic logic conditional obligations are defeasible conditionals in recent years several authors have proposed to solve the chisholm paradox' bv analyzing the problematic ctd obligation that occurs in it as a tvpe of overridden defeasibilitv  see eg  mrcartv  1  ryu and lee  1   1 the underlying idea is that a ctd obligation can be considered as a conflict ing obligation that override a primary obligation although this idea seems to be ver  intuitive at fust sight  we argue in this paper that this per/spec live of ctd obligations as a kind of overridden defeasibility is mislead ing it is misleading because although this perspective vields most  but not all'  of the correct conclusions for the chisholm paradox   it does so for the wrong rca sons we show that it is more appropriate to consider the. ctd obligation a.s a kind of factual defeasibilitv this docs not mean that the re is no place for overridden defeasibilitv in deontic logic bv a careful analysis of an extended version of another notorious paradox of d  otitic logie  the fonester paradox we show that sometimes combinations of factual and overridden defeasibilitv art needed to represent defeasible deontic reasoning but first we give our analysis of the   hisholm 'paradox. fust we present the 'paradox1 in a normal dvadu deontic logic to show its paradoxical character subsequently we analyze the paradox in a defeasible deontic logic m which there is only overridden defeasibilitv and discuss the shortcomings of this approach finally we give an analysis of the chisholm 'paradox in terms of factual dcfeasibility to make our analvsis as general as possible  we assume as little as possible about the deontic logie we use the analyses given in this paper m terms of inference patterns are  m principle  applicable to anv defeasible deontic logic 
　assume a deontic. logic with a finite piopositional base logic c and dyadic modal obligations 1 a | b   where b  the antecedent  and a  the consequent  arc sentences of c assume further the unrestricted strengthening of the antecedent rule sa 
		 1  
　　1  mccarty  1  does not analyze the chisholm 'paradox but thf so-called revkjavic 'paradox' which he considers to contain two instances of the chisholm 'paradox' each one interacting with the other' 
　finally  assume the deontic detachment  alias transitivity  rule dd 
		 1  
the notorious chisholm paradox'  chisholm  1  
 alias the ctd 'paradox   alias the 'paradox of deontic detachment  is as follows s 
example 1  chisholm 'paradox'  	consider the premises 	where t stands for any tautology a can be read as the fat t that a certain man qoes to the assistance of his ntiqhbors and t as the fact that he tells thevi he is  omtng 	tht premise is a ctd obliqeitum of the  primary  obliga-
because its antecedent is inconsistent vnth 
thf  onsequcnt of the latter 
   the intuitive 	obligation  can be derived by dd from the first two obligations 	ft seems intuitive 	because in the ideal situation the man qoes to the assistant f of his neiqhbors and he tells them he is coming 	hener if he does not tell them tht ideal situation is no longer reathable 	however 	from  the 	counterintuitive  can he derived by s a this is counterintuitive 
because there is no reason to tell them he is coming when the man docs not qo moreover in many denotes logics  are inconsistent 
　this counterintuitive obligation rannot be derived in a defeasible deontic logic with overridden defeasibility for our argument we use a notion of overridden based on specificity assume that sa is replaced b  the following restricted strength' mug of the antecedent rule rsa  rsao contains the so-called non-overridden condition 
co which represents that   i is not overridden b  some for it is based on a simplihed notion of spcciht it  because background knowledge is not taken into acrount and an obligation rannot be o ernddcn b  more than one obligation

　　　1 tbe conceptual difference between cancelling and over shadowing is similar to the distinction between 'defeasibihtv and 'violanility' made in  smith 1  and  prakken and ser got  1  however  the essential difference between these papers and this one is that in this paper we argue that v i o lability has to be considered as a type of defeasibihty too 
　　'see  tan and van der torre  1b  1  for a semantic analysis of the two types in the multi preference spmantics there are two distinct preferenre orderings one ideality preference ordering which can be used to formalize deontic reasoning about subideal behavior and one normality preference ordering which can be used to formalize a notion of ovf rndden
