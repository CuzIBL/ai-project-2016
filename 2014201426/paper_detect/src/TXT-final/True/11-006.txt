       the purpose of t h i s paper is to r e p o r t on a program  mapsee  t h a t reads sketch maps. the i n t e n t i o n is not to discuss the o v e r a l l goals o f t h i s research nor how i t f i t s i n t o c u r r e n t computational v i s i o n concerns except i n s o f a r as it d i r e c t l y impinges on them. those issues are t a c k l e d in d e t a i l in a companion paper  mackworth  1 . s u f f i c e it to say h e r e   by way of i n t r o d u c t i o n   t h a t one of thus one focus of the c u r r e n t work i: to explore the l i m i t s of the c u e / d e s c r i p t i v e model approach to v i s i o r w i t h p a r t i c u l a r emphasis on the modularity t h a t it buys. another focus is an aspect of the chicken-and-egg problem  mackworth 1b  namely  can one segment before i n t e r p r e t i n g   if so  how  - given t h a t t complete segmentation r e q u i r e s p r i o i i n t e r p r e t a t i o n . in t h i s domain  and ir many o t h e r s i suspect  the semantics ar  so r i c h t h a t a p a r t i a l segmentation thai is c o n s e r v a t i v e in many d i f f e r e n t ways i! s u f f i c i e n t to a l l o w a b o o t s t r a p i n t o ar i n t e r p r e t a t i o n . by ' r i c h s e m a n t i c s '   mean simply t h a t t h e r e e x i s t s a large number of p a r t i a l l y independent but m u t u a l l y c o n f i r m i n g i n f e r e n c e paths. furthermore  the i n i t i a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o r can t h e n   i n t u r n   r e f i n e the i n i t i a l p a r t i a l segmentation.  see  f o r example   yakimovsky and feldman  1    tenenbaun and barrow  1  and   s t a r r anc mackworth  1  f o r o t h e r approaches tc t h i s problem.  
	1. 	the maps 
　　　　the maps chosen f o r t h i s study were sketched f r e e - h a n d on a g r a p h i c a l data t a b l e t . no great e f f o r t was made to drav the map c a r e f u l l y . the map shown in figure 1 gives many people pause before they see t h a t it d e p i c t s an i s l a n d on 

the goals 	is to understand how to 	e x p l o i t the semantics 	of 	images designed communication as t y p i f i e d by sketches  g e n e r a l   	and sketch maps 	in p a r t i c u l a r . 
       another goal 	is to t r a n s f e r the 	c u r r e n t 	v i s i o n 	paradigm domains. 	one of the 	u s e f u l emerge 	from  	e a r l i e r work was an approach to v i s i o n as a task of 	understanding 
i m p l i c a t i o n s 	of 	l o c a l 	cues 	i n v o k i n g models t h a t 	placed 	c o n s t r a i n t s 	on i n t e r p r e t a t i o n 	o f p i c t u r e 	elements neighbourhood of the 	cue. 	the clowes-waltz 	approach 	 waltz  example  	used 	j u n c t i o n s 	as corners 	as 	models 	w i t h placed on the edges at the c o r n e r s   poly  mackworth  	1  	1  edges and 	s u r f a c e s . 	one 	purpose d e s i g n i n g 	mapsee was to demonstrate the c o n s t r a i n t 	s a t i s f a c t i o n approach much wider a p p l i c a b i l i t y 	than blocks w o r l d . 	this 	r e q u i r e d   f u r t h e r g e n e r a l i z a t i o n o f 	the network 	c o n s i s t e n c y 	a l g o r i t h m s 

which t h e r e are two towns connected by a road which crosses a b r i d g e over a r i v e r which r i s e s in a mountain range in the n o r t h - w e s t   and runs to a d e l t a in a bay on the southern shore. the o n l y major p o s s i b l e geographical elements allowed by the c u r r e n t mapsee but missing from t h a t map are i n l a n d l a k e s . moreover  the land area need not be an i s l a n d - it could cover the e n t i r e map. the c a r t ographic elements may be arranged in any of the l e g a l ways t h e i r c o r r e s p o n d i n g geographic o b j e c t s c o u l d . 
	1. 	i n t e r p r e t a t i o n 	in context: 	cues and 
models 
	to understand the general 	n a t u r e of 
mapsee the f o l l o w i n g experiment is suggested. cut a small hole in a piece of paper and place it on the map. as you move it around the map ask y o u r s e l f  what could t h a t be   i n i t i a l l y   i f y o u ' r e l o o k i n g at a l i n e then c l e a r l y it could be c o n s t r a i n t s on the l i n e a l and a r e a l components of the cue. the i n i t i a l enormous a m b i g u i t y of i n t e r p r e t a t i o n is reduced by these l o c a l models. it is f u r t h e r reduced by a l l o w i n g the models to t a l k to each o t h e r and agree upon the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s o f p i c t u r e elements t h a t they m u t u a l l y i n t e r p r e t . this process i s handled by a network c o n s i s t e n c y a l g o r i t h m t h a t p r o g r e s s i v e l y e l i m i n a t e s

a r o a d   a r i v e r   f l o w i n g in one d i r e c t i o n or the o t h e r     a b r i d g e   a mountainside or a s h o r e l i n e  of a lake or of the sea  the water on one side or the on the o t h e r hand  you see a blank space  an a r e a l element  it could be or sea. if you now t e m p o r a r i l y remove paper w i t h the hole in it and as a whole  you w i l l n o t i c e l i n e a l elements appear to aggregate u n i t s of connected l i n e s each u n i f o r m i n t e r p r e t a t i o n . s i m i l a r l y   the a r e a l elements aggregate i n t o r e g i o n s t h a t have i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s . 
　　　　as you resume moving the hole around the map  	you w i l l 	f u r t h e r d i s c o v e r a v a r i e t y 	o f 	i n t e r e s t i n g 	p i c t u r e which c o n s t r a i n t h e i r p a r t s . in a c h a i n   	f o r example  	r u l e s p o s s i b i l i t y 	t h a t 	i t 	i s p a r t 	o f a it c o u l d   	on the o t h e r hand  t o p   	in which case the chain is a mountain and the r e g i o n s on e i t h e r 	side l a n d   	or 	it 	could be p a r t of a coast in which case the r e g i o n on 	one l a n d   	the o t h e r being sea or v i c e 
or 	. . . 	. 	if a chain stops a b r u p t l y 
no other 	l i n e s 	anywhere 	in most 	c e r t a i n l y 	is 	not 	a

be a r i v e r source in which case the chain is a r i v e r f l o w i n g away from the f r e e end.  rivers may appear out of the ground they do not disappear i n t o i t . also s t a r t at lakes and 
they 	empty 	i n t o o t h e r r i v e r s   	lakes sea. 	they 	may  	however  disappear under a b r i d g e .   	or end could be a mountainside or 	. . . 
　　　　these 	i n f o r m a t i v e 	p i c t u r e are 	c a l l e d 	  p r i m a r y cues  
invoke models t h a t i n t e r p r e t the l o c a l e o f the cue thereby        a wide v a r i e t y of geographical and c a r t o g r a p h i c a l knowledge  t y p i f i e d by the sample i n f e r e n c e s given above  is captured in mapsee by the p r i m a r y cue i n t e r p r e t a t i o n c a t a l o g u e . the v a r i e t i e s of cue are shown in figure 1  w i t h names f o r t h e i r r e l e v a n t component p a r t s . 

       for each cue there is a set of models as l i s t e d in figure 1. each model constrains the interpretation of each part of the cue to belong to the set given. the interpretations of figure 1 are context-sensitive in that if the interpretations of a part are separated by a | then only one of them is possible. the direction of flow of a river is handled this way. a chain has associated with it the direction in which it was drawn. if   the river flows in that direction it is labelled   r i v e r   else   r i v e r *   . in the f i r s t interpretation of the tee  for example  the river can only flow into the tee on the stem-chain 
       in 	order 	to 	use this catalogue of models we must segment 	the picture 	into chains  	regions  	cue instances 	and the bindings 	of 	t h e i r 	components. 
unfortunately  that segmentation cannot be done perfectly  as we shall see  but it can be done with s u f f i c i e n t care that the models can start to make sense of the picture. that interpretation can then be used to refine the segmentation. the program mapsee  written in lisp  consists of the three phases: p a r t i a l segmentation  network consistency  and r e f i n i n g the segmentation. 
	1. 	the i n i t i a l partial segmentation 
1 	representations 
       mapsee receives a map in the form of a procedure for drawing i t   created by the routines that track the stylus on the data tablet. that i s   the input is a sequence of p l o t t e r commands where a command is move  pen up  to  x y  or draw  pen down  to  x y  from the current position. 
       there are so many points in this picture description  more than 1 for figure 1  that one of the main p r i o r i t i e s of a l l the segmentation routines is computational efficiency. there are two ways in which this is achieved. in the f i r s t place  a variety of d i f f e r e n t representations of the picture are maintained. each is appropriate for one or more purposes. secondly  when computing in a p i c t o r i a l representation  a segmenter only works at a level of detail appropriate to i t s current needs. 
　　　the procedural representation gives way to a network representation which i n i t i a l l y contains just chains 
 consecutive draws   line segments and segment end points. in this representation  each chain undergoes a process of generalization  as the 

cartographers call i t   whereby at each level of detail the chain is represented to within a certain tolerance. 
　　　f i n a l l y   there is an array representation indexed by the x-y coordinates of the end points. this is quite coarse  1  but allows quick answers to questions such as  what are you near   which uses a spiral search in the array. as discussed in the next section  the array representation is generalized in the process of region-finding to form a space occupation hierarchy of arrays of four elements each. 
1   1 	region segmentation 
　　　if we were to define a region as a connected subset of a 1d euclidean space  the picture  in our domain  would always have exactly one region! whenever the user intends to enclose a region he leaves a small  or  sometimes  not so small  gap  relying upon the map reader to divine his intention by reading his mind as well as the map. we cannot segment u n t i l we can interpret but we cannot interpret u n t i l we segment; this is the familiar ai chicken-and-egg problem. however  a i n i t i a l   p a r t i a l   conservative region segmentation is possible. a recursive algorithm p a r t i t i o n s the image into empty patches: subdividing a patch of space only if it is not empty. this top-down subdivision stops well before it could lead to trouble  at a level whose patch size is much greater than any unintentional gaps in the sketch. the empty adjacent patches are then merged to form the five regions shown in figure 1. the conservatism guarantees no leakage; no region so found w i l l correspond to more than one 'intended' region. but some intended regions may be represented by more than one found region: the large connected land region has been s p l i t into regions 1  1  1 and 1. other intended regions may not be represented at a l l : the two small land regions in the river delta have been missed. moreover  the extent of the found regions is somewhat less than their actual extent. as we shall see  the consistency process is very tolerant of these necessary idiosyncracies of the region segmenter. 
1 . 1 	cue segmentation 
       each of the cue 	types 	has i t s 	own specialized 	routines 	that 	discover 

instances in the picture. they lean heavily on the levels of d e t a i l in the representations for efficiency. moreover  they a l l have their own brand of conservatism. each is designed to rej ect a l l border-line cue instances. as the j o l l y green giant says   only the best w i l l do!  a tentative free end  for example  must be well in the clear   r e l a t i v e to the minimum patch size of the region segmentation  before it is accepted as a free end. an obtuse angle must have arms longer than a given minimum  straighter than a certain tolerance  angle considerably less than pi . . . . no false cues can be found so  as a r e s u l t   many genuine ones are ignored. the cues found are indicated by the hexagons in figure 1. 
1 	fleshing out the cues 
　　　　each cue instance needs to bind various picture elements  chains and regions  to i t s internal names. again  the segmentation process is heavily biased in favour of sins of omission rather than commission. i f   for example  it is looking for the region associated in a certain direction with a cue  it crawls carefully in that direction from the i n i t i a l point. if it finds a region within a very short distance  again  determined by the minimum patch size  well and good. but it it does not it w i l l give up rather than risk returning the wrong region. it it gives up it creates a region ghost  bobrow and winograd  1  

that stands for the region which has that relationship to the cue but cannot yet be i d e n t i f i e d . the region corresponding to the ghost may or may not exist as a found region. eighteen region ghosts were created during the segmentation of the sample map. 
	1. 	the consistency phase 
       the picture is now p a r t i a l l y segmented into chains  regions and p a r t i a l l y instantiated cues. in describing the consistency process  i w i l l ignore  for the time being  the four types of inadequacies in the segmentation  the extra regions  the missing regions  the missing cues and the region ghosts  and assume that the segmentation is perfect. subsequently  we shall see how those inadequacies affect the consistency process. 
　　　mackworth  1a  discusses and extends a class of algorithms t y p i f i e d by waltz's  1  arc consistency algorithm 
 called 	ac-1  	there  	and 	montanari's 
 1  path consistency algorithm  called pc-1   designed to satisfy a set of binary relations among a set of variables each of which must be instantiated in an associated domain. network consistency algorithms are often better than backtracking for such a task in that  by appropriate bookkeeping  they eliminate several kinds of thrashing behaviour. 
　　in waltz's blocks world  for example  the variables correspond to the junctions  the domains to the set of possible corners for each junction type and the binary relations to the edges  in that each edge must have the same interpretation imposed on it by each of i t s two corners. his network of relations was then isomorphic to the perfect line drawing being interpreted. 
　　　　in mapsee  the  variables  are the chains and the regions  which also must be interpreted: everything need not  indeed cannot  be packed into the chain i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s   . the domains are their context-free interpretations  that is {road  r i v e r   r i v e r *   mountain  bridge  shore  for chains and {land  lake sea  for regions. the relations are the cue instances  the constraint being the disjunction of the set of models for each cue instance. 
　　　the relations are now n-ary  not just binary  because each model relates from one to seven regions and chains. the network consistency algorithm used in mapsee given below is a suitably generalized version of ac-1  mackworth  1a . note that  in lieu of network consistency  one could  of course  backtrack on the values in the domains of the chains and regions  f a i l i n g back when any cue ceases to have a model which s a t i s f i e d the current values; however  the following algorithm  nc  is far more e f f i c i e n t . 
nc: 	an 	n-ary 	relation 	consistency 
algorithm 
1. construct a queue consisting of  variable relation  pairs in which each variable is paired with every relation that d i r e c t l y constrains i t . 
1. while the queue is not empty 	do 	steps 
1 and 1. 
1 remove the f i r s t pair  x r  from the queue. 
for each value  a  in the domain of variable x  dx  do step 1.1 
1.1 find at least one value in the domain of each of the other variables d i r e c t l y constrained by relation r such that a l l the values  including a  simultaneously satisfy r. if such values cannot be found delete a from 
dx. 
1 if 	any values were deleted from dx in step 1 then do step 1.1 
1.1 tf dx is now empty then return f a i l u r e as the result of this call else replace the queue by the union of the queue and the set of pairs obtained from a l l the relations other than r that constrain x  each relation paired with a l l the variables other than x that it constrains. 
1. at this step there are 	three 	possible states of the network: 
a  if every variable has exactly one element in i t s domain return that set of bindings as the result of this c a l l . 
b  if 	one 	variable  y  has k  k   1  elements in i t s domain 	and 	the 	rest have 	exactly 	one element return the k solutions formed by binding y 	to 	each of 	i t s 	values and the other variables to their unique values. 
c  if more than one variable has more than one element in i t s domain then s p l i t the domain of one of those variables approximately in half and return the solutions obtained by applying the algorithm recursively to the two subproblems so generated. 
	the 	algorithm either returns f a i l u r e 
 because some domain was exhausted  or one or more solutions each of which s a t i s f i e s a l l the r e l a t i o n s . the solutions are complete: no subsequent backtracking is necessary. the algorithm can be t r i v i a l l y modified to return just the f i r s t solution if desired. note that the ordering of the queue is unspecified: the process converges regardless; however  it may be treated as a p r i o r i t y queue. for example  sorting the queue so that strongly 

interrelated variables are more l i k e l y to be adjacent in the queue speeds convergence. 
　　　freuder  1  independently generalized the consistency arguments given  for binary r e l a t i o n s   in  mackworth  1a  to apply to n-ary relations. his algorithm is very different from the one presented here in that he e x p l i c i t l y constructs sets of a l l the n-tuples of values of the variables which satisfy each relation and deletes tuples from those sets. furthermore  he constructs similar exhaustive representations for a l l the i m p l i c i t relations induced by the ones given up to and including the global relation that relates a l l the variables. as with the binary relation consistency algorithms complexity analysis of these algorithms is d i f f i c u l t  for anything other than worst case  making e x p l i c i t comparison impossible. rest assured  though  that they are both inherently exponential  in the worst case  in that the problem is np-complete. for this task  however  nc requires far fewer cons cells and operations than freuder's algorithm. significant contributions to the development of network consistency algorithms have also been made by gaschnig 
 1   barrow and tenenbaum  1  and rosenfeld  hummel and zucker  1 . 
　　　　in the implementation of nc in mapsee each 	cue 	has a l i s t of models 	associated with i t . 	each instance of that cue has 	a set 	of 	bindings 	for 	i t s 	subparts 	to various 	chains 	and 	regions 	 the 
 variables1' it constrains . in step 1.1 of the algorithm  a structure matcher is used to match the cue instance against each model for the cue u n t i l a model is found a l l of whose parts match successfully. a part of a cue instance and the corresponding part of a model match i f f their domains have a non-nil intersection unless the instance part is the particular variable x in which case the model part must have interpretation a in i t s domain. 
　　　　for the sample map the consistency algorithm  nc  converged to unique values for a l l but one region in a single pass. the algorithm did not invoke i t s e l f recursively. the chain interpretations are as shown in figure 1. the only remaining ambiguity is in the interpretation of the surrounding region  r e g i o n l   as either sea or lake. the user may have intended  sea  but the island could  of course  be in a large lake whose shore is beyond the bounds of the map. regions 1  1  1 and 1 are a l l interpreted as land. the interpretations are  presumably  as intended by the user. 

	1  	refining the i n i t i a l segmentation 
　　　　in this section we w i l l consider the effect of the segmentation deficiencies on the consistency process and then see how the results of that interpretation process can be used to refine the segmentation. recall that the deficiencies are: the missing cues  the region ghosts  the missing regions and the extra regions. 
       the missing cues have no serious effect on the consistency process  provided  of course  that sufficient remain. a missing cue simply f a i l s to supply i t s extra constraints on the possible interpretations of the chains and regions. in this domain  however  there is such a welter of cues invoking consistent models that there is a multitude of p a r t i a l l y independent but mutually confirming inference paths. breaking a few of those inference paths causes no degradation in the interpretation. it is tempting to postulate that most perceptual tasks  in the real world  have the rich semantic  which give rise to this robustness property if we can but discover the appropriate language for the inferences and appropriate mechanisms for carrying them out.  the q u a l i f i c a t i o n  in the real world  is added because psychological experiments in the laboratory usually use meaning-deprived stimuli that rule out this phenomenon  clowes  1 .  
　　　the region ghosts are  if you l i k e   region intensions while the found regions are  imperfect  region extensions  woods  1 . a ghost is an intension in that it may be specified as  for example   the region on the reflex angle side of this similarly  the extra regions created by the s p l i t t i n g of a single intended region participate independently in the consistency process thereby exerting a weaker constraining effect than if the region had not been s p l i t . however  the semantic richness overcomes that weakening and forces the four found regions corresponding to the single intended land region  regions 1  1  1 and 1  to have that single i n t e r p r e t a t i o n . again  as in the other cases  if the region s p l i t t i n g is so severe as to cut too many inference paths then the process w i l l degrade gracefully  marr  1 . in that case the various found regions would not have the intended interpretation uniquely. it would simply be in the intersection of the possible interpretations of the found regions. 
         the t h i r d phase of mapsee uses the results of the consistency process to refine the i n i t i a l p a r t i a l segmentation. there are four ways in which this can be done: a  establishing distinctghosts with the same interpretation and location as co-extensive b  considering the merge of found regions with the same interpretation c  establishing a found region as the extension of a ghost with the same interpretation and d  discovering a new found region as the extension of one or more ghosts. these involve r e v i s i t i n g the picture and segmenting more purposefully  more carefully and at a finer level of detail in the particular areas concerned. figure 1 shows the f i n a l land region that results from the successful proposed merges of the separate i n i t i a l land regions. 

acute 	l . 	the 
d i s t i n c t i o n forms a spectrum rather s t r i c t 	dichotomy 	here. 	recall ghost arises 	when a 	cue f a i l s to find associated 	region; 	it 	may 	f a i l 
because 	it 	stopped 	looking too soon even 
though there is a found region because there is no ghosts participate in the process just as do the found regions. single cue that created a region constrains it and it is quite possible interpretations of the ghost progressively ruled out. after consistency process we s t i l l do the extension of a ghost but we more about it than before; 
may 	now 	be 	forced 	to 	have interpretation   l a n d   . 
       the missing regions  as in the delta  for example  also do not affect the consistency process. the cues 
in the neighbourhood of a 	missing 
w i l l have used ghosts standing in for a single missing there w i l l be several ghosts constraining effect w i l l be somewhat. 

	1. 	conclusions 
       i cannot here discuss how this work s a t i s f i e s the goals of the project nor future directions such as a  integrating s t i l l further the segmentation and interpretation phases  b  automating the generation of the primary cue interpretation catalogue by the provision of a language for describing the models so that transfer to other sketch worlds is f a c i l i t a t e d and c  the use of schemata as procedural models. suffice it to say that mapsee is an existence proof of the power of semantics in the interpretation of pictures. it demonstrates that the cue/descriptive model paradigm works in domains other than the blocks world  that the network consistency algorithms can be extended  that imperfect data can be overcome by a thoroughgoing conservatism in the segmentation process  that a p a r t i a l segmentation can yield an i n i t i a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n   and that the interpretation can sensibly r e f i n e the i n i t i a l segmentation.
