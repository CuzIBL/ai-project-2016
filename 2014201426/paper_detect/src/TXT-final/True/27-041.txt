 
　　in previous work we presented an algorithm for tense interpretation which employs a temporal focus to determine the intended temporal relations between the states and events mentioned in a narrative in this paper  we propose a new two-phased classification scheme for aspect each situation described in an utterance is first classified as static  state  or dynamic  event  and if dynamic as telic  event with a culmination point  or atelic  evenl without a culmination point  then  independent of the class the view of the situation is identified either as a point or as an interval we then demonstrate how the determination of aspect can be integrated into our tense interpretation algorithm to produce a richer analysis of temporal relations our classification for aspect is more detailed than most of the existing schemes allowing us to extract the interval relations between situations and cover a wide range of english narratives 
1 	introduction 
　　temporal analysis plays an important role in the understanding of natural language discourse and in particular  narratives and natural language input to plan recognition systems its goal is to determine the temporal relations between the states and events mentioned in a discourse  such as whether one event occurs before or during the time of another1 we generally refer to states and events as situations 
our focus has been on the temporal analysis of 
 simple  narratives in which there is one speaker and all utterances descnbe  actual  siluauons  which arc those asserted to have occurred to be occurring or to occur al a future time the reasons for these restrictions are to avoid conflicts in belief with 
1  in this paper we restrict ourselves to qualitative temporal relations quantitative information such as one event occurs before another by 1 minutes is not further distinguished

different speakers and to exclude situations described in modal intentional  negated or frequentative contexts  passonneau 1  there are many factors that may be integrated into such temporal analysis including tense aspect  temporal adverbials and connectives discourse structures and even real-world knowledge in song and cohen  we presented an algorithm for temporal analysis that is based solely on tense interpretation the algorithm expands the notion of temporal focus in webber  lo determine the intended temporal relations in a narrative more specifically we proposed a set of heuristics for determining the temporal ordering between a new situation and the situation in focus we also proposed a set of constraints for tracking the changes of a temporal focus the value of our algorithm is lo allow an implementation that can bt built into a working system being heunstic-based the algorithm may admit counter-examples  but u is designed to produce the preferred interpretation ol intended temporal ordenngs in the absence of high level information such as discourse structures and real world knowledge1 
　　in this paper we further expand our algorithm for temporal analysis with aspect determinauon which is to analyze which part of a situation is viewed in an utterance we regard tense as a grammatical notion that is expressed solely by verb forms for example  john wrote a letter  is in the simple past tense since the verb  write  is in its past form in contrast aspect is seen as a semantic notion which has to be determined compositionally from certain lexical items in an utterance tense and aspect together help provide a more accurate analysis for narratives 
allowing us lo extract interval relations between entire situations and cover a wide range ol utterances the paper therefore demonstrates that it is possible lo develop heuristics for temporal analysis which incorporate aspectual information we also reveal the value of aspectual information in temporal analysis by

  in song  1  we also considered those cases where lense sequences may lead lo more than one interpretation and how discourse structures and real-world knowledge can be used to resolve such ambiguities

  the symbols stand for  before meets  starts and during  from allen's interval algebra  allen 1  
   our detailed classification of aspect clearly distinguishes interval-based views from point-based

	song and cohen 	1 

views and allows us to use two sre triples to describe interval-based views as a result  we are able to handle two special cases the continuation effect of a perfect or a perfect-progressive tense is modeled by first creating a new tfs followed by the resumption to a previous tfs as in  john has been reading a b o o k   1 similarly  the predictive effect of a prospective tense is modeled by maintaining the current tfs followed by the creation of a new tfs as in  he is going to finish it in 1 minutes   
　　others have examined new algorithms for temporal analysis of text hwang and schubert  have focused on de-indexing logical form representation of sentences  performing temporal analysis in the context of what they refer to as a  tense tree  the discussion of aspect is limited and the question of integrating heuristics for preferred interpretations is left largely open kameyama et al  focus on clarifying rules for commonsensc interpretation of temporal relations in text they build on hwang and schubert's representation which goes beyond the standard reichenbachian framework once again  the role of aspect is not discussed in much detail interestingly enough* kameyama et al's analysis for past and past perfect tenses basically coincides with our analysis when the underlying discourse structures and the real-world knowledge are not available this is perhaps not surprising since both analyses use heuristics as default rules for tense interpretation 
1 	discussion 
　　this paper has presented a classification scheme for aspect and demonstrated how aspectual analysis can be combined with tense interpretation to produce a richer algorithm for the temporal analysis of english narratives the algorithm requires a temporal focus structure and both point and interval representations of event times ii may be seen as a core procedure for the analysis of text  which employs heuristic rules for interpretation  and could be integrated with other routines for interpreting discourse level cue phrases and more complex temporal expressions we believe that having heuristics for temporal analysis is extremely valuable systems can be built and default interpretations offered using whatever temporal information has been successfully analyzed and drawn into the algorithms these systems can be run on examples to see where heuristics may be improved 
　　the algorithm presented here has been implemented and also tested on a small corpus of examples with more complex temporal indicators temporarily factored out  see song  for more details  below we present one of our sample examples  our personal interpretation of the expected 
1  * this sentence would occur in a narrative and be analyzed with respect to the current tfs
