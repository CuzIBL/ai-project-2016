i 	introduction 
     theories concerning the understanding of stories and the generation/telling of them have developed rapidly in the last few years: terms l i k e  script based  and  goal based  have been i n i t i a t e d and interpreted  rieger 1  schank 1  
schank 1   	 story t e l l i n g rules  and 
 plot units  have been established  beaugrande 1  lehnert 1    and the notion of  interestingness  has been discussed  schank 1 . for the type of stories that has been labelled  author intent based   dehn 1  there has been 
established 	a d i f f e r e n t i a t i o n between the  plot  and the  story   yazdani 1 . 
     on the basis of these studies  henceforth by plot we mean the network of events linked by causal links  schank 1   as it may be reconstructed after reading the book  a mental record of  what happened and why   while the story is the way the plot is rendered in the 
book. 
     according to the mutual belief of author and reader  in each story the elements invoke a larger mutually understood schemata  bruce 1  there is a consensus between author and reader concerning the rules and means that can be applied. 
     the question we try to answer is the following: what makes agatha christie interesting  we have chosen to discuss agatha christie's work for the reason that the rules are rather s t r i c k t   the means are simple and both are common knowledge. 
     we are interested in crime stories as far as they meet the following c r i t e r i a : the intention of the author is to engage the reader's attention  but without i n volving him emotionally. 
     the consensus between author and reader includes murder  some  old domestic poisoning drama   orwell 1   as the key element of the p l o t . according to this consensus the world of the plot should be small-scale and closed; most of the characters must be honest  normal people. motivation should be proportionate to the deed  plans should contain no alternative courses  etc. there are rules concerning what the detective can or cannot do.the consensus about the way of representation forbids to t e l l anything but the truth through the narrator  and demands that the amount of unnecessary information should not be more than the minimum what is needed to keep dialogues flowing. 
     the method we have applied is the following: a reader  well-versed  in agatha christie went through one of her works /that our choice should not be arbitrary it was the very f i r s t book in which monsieur poirot appeared  christie 1 / making plenty of notes while he read. we have neglected the danger inherent in our method  namely  that the conclusions we w i l l arrive at may be valid only for one single book. hopefully  we shall be able to offer something more enlightening than the common-place claim that reading agatha christie is interesting in the same way as riddle-solving i s . 

ii what is definitely not the key to agatha christie's interestingness  
　　　we cannot agree with propositions a t t r i b u t i n g much interestingness to factors like the interestingness of the characters or that of the plot i t s e l f - we usua l l y forget what happened in a crime story as soon as we shut the book  moreover  the more stories of a certain type we have read the greater is our enjoyment of the next one. it is not the  race with the detective  what makes reading agatha christie interesting. the reader may t r y to guess the murderer earlier than the last chapter when he is t o l d   but agatha christie ensures that he should not succeed. neither does the interestingness l i e in the fact that we get convinced of the correctness or the i n e v i t a b i l i t y of the outcome - we seldom re-read any crime stories. it is the process - and not the result - of the reading we enjoy. 
1 the pressure to infere; delusions 
　　　at f i r s t   l e t us consider not the reasons why the reader feels compelled to infere but the nature of his inferences. 
　　　if he considers an item to be relevant at a l l   
/1/ he judges the degree in wich it is guaranted to be true by the rules of the game  
1/ 	assigns a degree of normality to i t   
/1/ 	enhances the importance of other items linked conceptually to that partic-
ular one  and - if it is possible -
/1/ 	labels it according to the stereotypes that can occur in connection with crime /the weapon  a l i b i e s   e t c . /   
i1i f i t s in into the framework of the  real world  and projects it to the plot-world. 
　　　these a c t i v i t i e s are running parallel and modifying each other a l l the time  with the application of some contextual production rules  kayser and coulon 1 . besides  he inserts the newly found item into a structure he believes the plot possesses: he interprets it as an element of a particular script or plan  or as something that refers to the motives of certain characters. thus he enhances the accessability of the information obtained by his inference process while the o r i g i n a l   unprocessed information is thrust into the background. 
a. markus 1 
　　however  the key question remains: what makes the reader infere and what makes him err  our proposition is that readers are unable to remember too many unrelated items; if they want to keep in touch with the story they have to risk faulty interpretations  since if they don't  pieces of information  as soon as they occur  may be forgotten once and for a l l . readers prefer to base their inferences on 'items in the focus of attention . by items in the focus of attention we mean pieces of information which are either new or have been used many times or which have often changed their c r e d i b i l i t y . certain types of inference have a special appeal: these are the ones which 
1 are based on suprizing  abnormal items  
/1/ seem to support an already existing belief - thus the reader has a  vested interest  in their being the right ones  
/1/ decrease considerably the size of the structure he thinks he has to remember.he may try to guess the size of the plot but he is l i k e l y to underestimate i t : thus by expecting a simple solution he w i l l aim at an oversimplified one. 
inferences /1/ which produce information connected to what he thinks to be the mainspring of the plot have a special appeal too - although the writer carefully mixes these information into the flow of the story. 
iv revision of beliefs  the interestingness of a crime story 
　　while reading the story the reader is continually f i t t i n g new items into the belief structures he has established a l ready. when in the course of this process he comes accross a new item that seems to be contradictory to this structure he is compelled to revise his b e l i e f s . a reader well-informed in ai may attempt to do this in a way suggested by the algorithms of the truth maintenance system  doyle 1   but he is not too l i k e l y to succeed  the less so  since the tms does not suggest a safe method which could decide which assumption is to be modified. 
　　while backtracking the contradiction  the humble and hasty reader is more l i k e l y to consider only those of his beliefs that happen to be in the focus of attention at the moment. what's more  if a belief has just been weakened  he is l i k e l y to over-
weaken i t . these facts  together with certain deliberate deceptions on the author's part  for instance  making the reader feel much more clever than the good hastings  belong to the stock of methods agatha christie frequently applies. 

1 a. markus 
       when judging the interestingness of a book he has just finished the reader recalls how he has been compelled to form beliefs and change them  and if he feels that he has been deceived in a degree corresponding to his own expectations and it has been done by the application of   f a i r   methods he w i l l be s a t i s f i e d . 
       if we accept the propositions concerning the process of reading discussed above  then the i n t e l l i g e n t agatha christie reader should be regarded as someone who is able to judge the importance of the items 
and to generalize their consequences in an appropriate degree  schank 1 ; to realize that he has a  belief sys-
tem  on his hands  abelson 1 ; to infer not only in an incremental 
way  that his inferences should consolidate one of his b e l i e f s ; to have a breadth-first approach; to store in his memory  beside the i n -
terpretations  the original items as well in order that they should be accessible for reappraisal for a different inference  too 	 kayser and coulon 1 ; to store a considerable number of 
seemingly unrelated items; to apply j u s t i f i c a t i o n s  doyle 1  
in the proper way when modifying his 
b e l i e f s . 
v 	concluding remarks 
       that we could have drawn so few conclusions by analysing a work of marginal l i t e r a r y value may be regarded as a warning against overrating our p o s s i b i l i t i e s in analysing the interestingness of stor i e s . nevertheless  at last we have suggested a solution of what is happening when you are reading and enjoying agatha christie  although  of course  other readers may come across different types of regularity and different values. 
       considering how many different effects are mixed in a real crime story it is not too l i k e l y that we can verify any propositions concerning the interestingness of crime stories through generating some   a r t i f i c i a l   ones - not even in a case when the simplest step  namely the transformation from the plot to a presentation plan would be made by formal means. 
       the only rule valid for every possible case seems to be that very old one that a story becomes alive if and only if it unsettles some of the accepted rules of story t e l l i n g pertinent to that type. but in a purpose-oriented and not in an arbitrary way. 
       two suggestions: agatha christie's oeuvre is public property: why should we not use these crime stories as standard works for the analysis of story-generation and telling  besides  it would be interesting to examine what happens when we enjoy 
works of other genres unfolding in time  such as  for instance  music  especially the ways interesting structure is created out of elements quite uninteresting in themselves. the reason what makes this phenomenon occur may be the very limitedness of our resources.
