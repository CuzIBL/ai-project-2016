 
when specificity considerations are incorporated in default reasoning systems  it is hard lo ensure that exceptional subclasses inherit all legitimate features of their parent classes to reconcile these two requirements specificitv and inheritance  this paper proposes the addition of a new rule called coherence rule  to the desiderata for default inference the coherence rule captures the intuition that formulae which are more compatible with the defaults in the database are more believable we offer a formal definition of this extended desiderata and analyze the behavior of its associated closure relation which we call coherence closure we provide a concrete embodiment of a system satisfying the extended desiderata by taking the coherence closure of system z a procedure for computing the  unique  most compact  be lief ranking in the coherence closure of svstem z is also described 
1 	introduction 
it has been proposed  makinson    1 hrauh et al    1  that default reasoning systems be analyzed in terms of their  default  consequence relations a number of in ference rules  or axioms  have generally been accepted  pearl  1 makinson  1  as a reasonable set of desiderata for a commonsense consequence relation de spite  lie general acceptance of these detiderata  they fail to reconcile two accepted lines of reasoning widely known as  inheritance  and 'specificity' these can be illustrated by the classical tweety example as follows consider the database  figure 1  containing four defaults   penguins are birds'  'penguins do not fly'  birds fly' and'birds have wings'  specificity' tells us. that lf tweety is a penguin  then tweety does not fly because penguin is a more specific classification of tweety than bird  inheritance   on the other hand  does equip tweety with wings by virtue of being a bird albeit an exceptional bird with respect to flying ability

　the inheritance and specificity lines of reasoning depend on the interactions among the defaults in the database an inspection of the rules proposed in past desiderata reveals that  invariably  each rule refers to the defaults database as one unit no reference is made to specific subsets of defaults  the interaction among which produces the tension between inheritance and specificity in this paper we propose a new rule  called coherence  that resolves this tension intuitively  the coherence rule prefers formulas that are more compatible with the defaults database we will formalize the requirements of inheritance and specificitv  and show that any consequence relation that satisfies the coherence rule  and the standard desiderata  will honor both requirements in the next section  we review the accepted desiderata  including rational monotony   pearl  1l  before introducing the coherence rule we will analyze the behavior of the closure of the extended desiderata which we call coherence closure 
　in section 1 we refine the semantics of system z  pearl 1  to satisfy the coherence rule first we review the semantics of system z and the definition of belief rankings coherence constraints arc then further imposed on admissible rankings to make them satisfy the coherence rule we show that the resulting system is sound with respect to the extended desiderata we also present a procedure for computing the most compact admissible belief ranking in the coherence closure in the last sec tion we compare related work

counterintuitive as this conclusion is obtained indepen dently of the meaning of t thus even if   represents the statement sells hamburgers in macdonald s violation of this statement is still considered less ' damaging than i he violation of the default students are tvpicallv not   mplo ed such counterintuitive behavior is not present in our semantics 
　in  delgrande 1   an approach based on preference ordenngs between worlds was presented b  ginning with in extant theory of default conditionals an  dt faull that is true in tins original theorv prefers a world in which the material counterpart is true over a world in which it is filse in the new theorv a preference between two worlds is true when it can bt attributed to some default and  litre is no more specific default that has a contradictory preference the notion of specificity is also defined in terms of the truth of defaults in the original theory tins reliance on an extant theorv of defaults make the system unnatural and complex i he intuitiveness of such a two step definition of a default lheorv is questionable and lacks a good philosophical justification it is also not known if the desiderata is satisfied bv the system 
　in  geffner  1 inference rules 1 to 1 wtre supplemented by an irrelevance rule which  unfortunate!}  involves the evaluation of a meta-logical irrelevance predicate i{   the proposed default consequence relation called conditional entailment was also shown to satisfy inference rules 1 to 1 together with irrelevance rule conditional entailment like coherence closure is also denned m terms of preferences among worlds i he preference among worlds  in turn  depends on a priority relation among normality defaults specified by the user ii turns out that if the priority relation is erupt}  i e all defaults have the same priority  then conditional entailment turns out to be equivalent to coherence closure 
much work in default reasoning has been guided by examples rather than on generally accepted principles of reasoning we hope our general formalization of notions such as specificity  inheritance and coherence will help change this trend it remains to be seen  though  whether the extended desiderata is sufficient for capturing other patterns of plausible reasoning
