mantics-pragmatics l e v e l in a natural language understanding system. 
　　　the choice of the notions to be considered has been r e l i e d upon a necess i t y o f special f a c i l i t i e s f o r describing situations w i t h various degrees of d e t a i l i n g according to an inexact character of temporal information in natur a l language t e x t s . 
　　　time is modelled as a straight d i rected l i n e   and four main objects: point  i n t e r v a l   quantity and chain t o gether w i t h four groups of notions associated w i t h them are included into the 
model. 
　　　a structure of the t-model and i t s base notions are b r i e f l y outlined in the f i r s t section of the paper. the r e presentation of temporal information by means of t-model objects is then considered by examples. 
1. introduction 
1. a problem of representing and understanding temporal information is of great importance in the process of developing and implementing ai systems i n tended f o r dynamic object domains  i . e . those dealing w i t h s i t u a t i o n s varying in time. in t h i s paper a formal model of time  t-model  is outlined which provides a method f o r dealing w i t h temporal information in nl-understanding systems. 
　　　these problems are now considered in a great number of works on knowledge representation and automatic text comprehension  see  f o r example  goldstein  1; dembovskaya  1; litvinceva  1; a l l e n   1; hirshman  1. 
　　　our t-model contains several n o t i ons s i m i l a r to those considered in the papers mentioned above  but on the whole it provides f a r more general f a c i l i t i e s of representing temporal information. it also includes a number of new components forming developed system of n o t i ons f o r d e f i n i n g dates  time range measures  r e p e t i t i v e events etc. an accurate d i s t i n c t i o n between the proper f o r mal means and t h e i r i n t e r p r e t a t i o n is made in the model. 
1. our t-model may be used as a standard component of a knowledge represent a t i o n system providing temporal data processing. it consists of a set of notions  objects  r e l a t i o n s   and a r.et of productions describing t h e i r semantics. 
　　　the notions of the model are represented by means of rather simple framestructures  due to the s i m p l i c i t y of the object domain . 
　　　this paper is a continuation of  kandrashina  1   in which a f i r s t version of the t-model and i t s implement a t i o n in the frameworks of the vostok system has been described. 
　　　there are two parts in the paper. f i r s t part 	 section 1  gives character i s t i c 	of the t-model notions  	second one  section 1  considers some variants of using the base t-model objects 	f o r representing temporal components of knowledge. 
1. basic notions of t-model 
　　　time is modelled as a s t r a i g h t d i rected l i n e . four objects: point  i n t e r v a l   chain and quantity considered below in d e t a i l are the basic notions of the t-model. 
1 . 1 . since such objects as point and/or i n t e r v a l have been studied in almost a l l the works on temporal aspects of knowledge representation  a set of notions connected w i t h them is only outl i n e d here. 
　　　order r e l a t i o n s         =  = and a distance f u n c t i o n r { x1.  x1} are defined over the points  x  x1    x 1   . . .   . the quantity is a value of the distance f u n c t i o n . the noti'on of the quantity plays an a u x i l i a r y role and allows denotatum of  quantity of time   time range 
measure  to be separated from represent a t i o n of i t s number value. this notion is also sketched in the paper. it should be noted that special types of s t r u c tures f o r i n d i c a t i n g i t s number value by means of u n i t s of measurement are defined f o r the quantity  1 years; 1 hours; and 1 months; 1 hours
