 
　　　the f i e l d of natural language data base query has seen several successful research systems that have been able to process large subsets of the english language. the robot system is a high performance natural language processor that extends the techniques developed in these earlier systems  in an attempt to provide a usable natural language query medium for non-technical users. 
　　　robot is already i n s t a l l e d in four real  world environments  working in five application areas. analysis of log f i l e s indicate that between 1% of end user requests are successfully processed. the system successfully deals with both lexical and s t r u c t u r a l ambiguity  i n t e r - and i n t r a sentential pronomilization and sentence fragments. the resource requirements of robot are w e l l w i t h i n the l i m i t s of medium to large computer systems. 
　　　this paper describes the system from an information flow point of view. the goal is to obviate the creation of a semantic store purely for the natural language parser  since a d i f f e r e n t structure would be required for each domain of discourse. instead the data base i t s e l f is used as the primary knowledge structure within the system. in t h i s way the parser can be interfaced to other data bases with only minimal e f f o r t . 
sample dialog 
the following    questions w i l l give some idea of the current c a p a b i l i t i e s of the system. they refer to a personnel and car data base. 
give me the names of all employees who have jobs working as a secretary in the city of  chicago. 
this question and the 1 that follow indicate the range of allowable expression  from verbose wordings to fragments. 
print 	the 	names 	of 	all 	the 	chicago 
employees working as secretaries. 
who are the chicago secretaries  
secretaries in chicago. 
 the following sentences i l l u s t r a t e the l e x i c a l ambiguity of the word  and . print the salary of smith and lawler. 
who earns between $ 1   1 1 and $1  print the name  phone and family status of all the new york state girls. find the cars made by porsche and made in 
'1. 
this example i l l u s t r a t e s how prepositions can be the c r i t i c a l factor in determining the f i e l d reference. 
how many nh and ct people are there  broken down by state and city  print a 
salary report for these people  including their name and age. 
 the following sequence i l l u s t r a t e s how pronouns can be used to refer back to e a r l i e r points in the dialog. who are the secretaries  
which of them live in chicago  
 there are now two v a l i d pronoun referents. which of them live in detroit  
in this case the pronoun referent is clearly the o r i g i n a l set of secretaries  thus no c l a r i f i c a t i o n is required. 
which ones are not married  
this question would require user c l a r i f i c a t i o n   since the user could be r e f e r r i n g to a l l of the secretaries or just the detroit secretaries. 
　　　sources of information fortunately  	the contents of 	the data base define 	a 	s u f f i c i e n t l y 	r e s t r i c t i v e 	micro world 	such 	that 	only 	limited 	world knowledge 	is 	required 	by 	the 	parsing process. 	a very surprising 	and fortunate fact is that the data base i t s e l f can serve as 	this 	body 	of 	world 	knowledge. 
furthermore  the existing structure of the data  in the comparatively s i m p l i s t i c form used by existing dbmss  is adequate for data base query. in t h i s section we discuss this entire question of how d i f f e r e n t kinds of information or world knowledge  are brought to bear on the understanding of a query. we consider there to be four d i s t i n c t sources of information that can be applied to the understanding of a request. in order of their r e l a t i v e preference  we make use of: 
1  the dictionary  
1  the sentence i t s e l f   1  the data base  and 1  the user. 
let us discuss each of these in turn  and then discuss how they complement one another in providing enough information to understand the user's request. 
　　　the dictionary is the t r a d i t i o n a l table of word stems  syntactic categories  and semantic uses. unfortunately it contains only localized information that must be pieced together to form a complete semantic structure. 
　　　the sentence i t s e l f is the primary source of information related to f i g u r i n g out what the user requires. i n i t i a l l y most people believe that the sentence i t s e l f is a l l that is required to determine what the user wants. unfortunately this is not the case  as many of the user's requests w i l l be incomplete or p o t e n t i a l l y ambiguous. for example  consider the request   tell me 
about the fords'. this request is incomplete because it doesn't s p e c i f i c a l l y t e l l what information the user wants about the  fords . it is ambiguous because the question may be interpreted in two t o t a l l y d i s t i n c t ways in the context of a f i l e of presidents  or a f i l e of cars. information
