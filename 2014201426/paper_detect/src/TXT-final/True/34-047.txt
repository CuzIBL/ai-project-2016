i n t r o d u c t i o n 
in the f i e l d of problem solving information has been gathered about e f f i c i e n t search techniques and about kinds of representation of problems   1   . we have only found few cases of application of these problem solving methods in computer-aided design   1   1   1   . fields of application of these results are mainly the organization of search processes for robots and for question answering systems. 
this paper deals w i t h the r a t i o n a l i zation of design processes by means of problem solving methods. we formulate general features of the class of combin a t o r i c a l problems  which we found in various phases of design processes. one example of t h i s class is placing the components of an e l e c t r o n i c c i r c u i t onto p r i n t e d c i r c u i t boards or substrates so as to minimize the number of connections between boards. for the s o l u t i o n of these problems we a p p l i c a t e methods of 
a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e - the a l g o r i t h m s   which we got as a r e s u l t of our i n v e s t i getione  are described. i n i t i a l t r i a l s of a p p l i c a t i o n of these algorithms i n d i cate that they have s i g n i f i c a n t power for e f f e c t i v e l y solving the described problems. 
	problem 	formulation 
in a paper  1  we have shown that comb i n a t o r i c a l problems a r i s e i n e l e c t r i c a l and mechanical engineering. the e f f e c t i v e s o l u t i o n of these problems is one 
way in r a t i o n a l i z i n g the design process. 
the main p r o p e r t i e s of these problems 
	are the 	f o l l o w i n g : 
1. the elements x of the set x of p o t e n t i a l s o l u t i o n objects are composed of elements a   b   . . of sets a b .... . an element x could be a subset of a  a subset of axb  a pa r t i t i o n of a  and so on. 
1. the elements x of the set x of admiss i b l e s o l u t i o n objects are charact e r i z e d by a set p  of predicate p   x   . with p  x  we describe the p r o p e r t i e s determining the a d m i s s i b i l i t y of elements x. 
1. the elements x of the set xe of o p t i -
e 
mal s o l u t i o n objects are described by means of a set p of predicate wxth p = p*u  p   x     . pe x  is formulated on the basis of the cost g x : 

in particular tasks specifications of these points are given. choosing the state-space approach of problem solving the set of states of the state-space is the set x of possible solution objects 
and the set of goal states x is characterized by p* or p. for chan1ging state 
x into state x' we must define operators o. the problem is to generate states 
 from states  means of 
the operators o of a set 1. to i l l u s t r a te these ideas we give some examples for such combinetorical problems. decomposition problems 
decomposition problems arise in the f i e l d of e l e c t r i c a l c i r c u i t design  in the f i e l d of organization of work  and in system analysis. the solution object x of a decomposition problem is a partition of a set a in n subsets a1. we set for decomposition problems x -  a1 a  . a relation f over a is defined trrough these subsets a . relation fx holds between the elements ai and aj of set a if these elements are in the same subset a . 
for the layouts of e l e c t r i c a l c i r c u i t design the following decomposition problem with restrictions must be solved: 

1 

an operator o i n;m  of the set o1 joins together an element ai of the subset a 
and the subset am  see figure 1 . for a 
partition x the number of operators in set 1 is equal to kn multiplied by  n-1 . an operator o n n;m  of the set 1 joins together a subset n of an and subset a  see figure 1 . an operator  operator  with size of 
n equai to 1. for a partition x the number of operators in set 1 is equal to the number of possible subsets n in a multiplied by  n-1 . 

i i  a 1   is the mean value of the binding strengths c   i   j   between the element and a l l other elements e.c a   this one between the element and a l l elements a t a . we have  m 
j
special definitions for cases with size of subset am   m equal to 1 and with size of subset a  equal to 1. we must find a partition with maximal g x . to solve this problem we investigated solution processes on the basis of sets 1 and 1 of operators. an operator o i l;m  of set 1 units the element a. of the subset a  and the subset a . this is analogous to operator  partition x there 
are k n-l  operators of this set. an operator o l m  of the set 1 joins together the subsets a  and  partition x we have o 1 n-l n operators of this set.

- choice of a start object x . 
- selection of a set of operators  
- selection of a subset of applicable operators from the chosen set. 
- selection of an operator from this subset. the application of this operator produces the next object. we repeat these steps u n t i l a break-off 
point is reached. 
- determination of a break-off point. 
the selection process is based on heuristic rules for operators oxx- x'. a rule is defined by means of the weight  for 
an operator o. we got these weights as a 
result of the analysis of the costs g x  
and g x' . so these weights are dependent from the object x and/or from the 
object x'. through the kind of computation of these weights we are sure that they are only computed for applicable 
operators. 
the power of algorithms for the solution of such problems is determined by the time for generating objects x and by the 
cost g x . in the field of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence search techniques are developed for generating goai states in the state-space approach of problem solvingwe adapted and developed these techniques to get efficient algorithms. the algorithms do not generate optimal solution objects with probability 1. the objects x are the states in the problem space  the operators of the sets 1. 
 i=1 .. 1  realize the transitions between states  we are going to describe briefly the general solution algorithm 
for the decomposition problems. the efficiency of the search process is 
determined by the following steps  1  : 
1 

in a l l ce&es the best operator of the set of applicable operators is this one with the maximal weight. distinct v a r i ants of search algorithms based on these operators and weights are implemented. on the basis of the efficiency of the various algorithms a variant with the following characteristics is f i r s t l y choosed: 
- select the f i r s t element a of the subset a from a n= a. there are several p o s s i b i l i t i e s for this selection which here we do not discuss. 

with the kind of computation of the weights it is provided that only applicable operators are selected. with the help of this algorithm we found out that the cost g x  is hardly to increase by the application of operators from the set 1 after the generation of the first aduissible object by means of oe 1~. 
a better solution object at the expense of the search time is attainable through the application of operators o n n;m  instead of operators o ifn;m . with these operators we select subsets ncan 
with a predetermined number vof elemen ts and join together n and a . in our a l gorithm we consider not a l l possible v -subsets n of a . instead we compute subsets n element by element by means of operators from the set 1: 
vve generate a l l possible sequences of length vwith weights  i n;m  and 
 i  n;m  as elements. on the basis of each of these sequences we determine a sequence of operators o i n;m . the 
application of each operator sequence results in a single v-eubset n. each of these subsets generated by an operator sequence is a subset n of on operator o n n;m   the weights  n n;m  are then determined and the operator with the maximal weight is selected. 
in an analogous wey the algorithm for the solution of the decomposition problem 
without restrictions is generated on the basis of operators of the sets 1. and 1. 
for the selection of an operator from the set 1 we choose as weight 1 i 1;m  the component h. a   of the cost g x . we select the operator with the minimal 
weight. after reaching the subgoal hi  a1   1 for i=1 k we applicate operators of the set 1. the selection process of these operators is controlled by the weight 
a  is determined by the element a. in this computation. the operator with the maximal weight is applicated. the search process stops after reaching a threshold value for  m  1 . 
applications 
the presented algorithms are based heavily on experimental evidence  a l though there are quite plausible reasons for performing the particula r operations  1 . in the following we characterize some applications. 
we examined the behaviour of the a l gorithm for the decomposition problem without restrictions if the matrix of coefficients c   i   j   is a matrix with known clusters. so the algorithm always finds in a set a the partition x* with the following properties if this parti-

the maximal possible coefficient in the 
matrix of coefficients. .vith the start object x  the 
algorithm stops after reaching the partition x*. this algorithm is applicated for the clustering of experimental data  
which are the results of an experiment for the identification of inner structures in human problem solving. baseo on 

1 

such groupings we could give statements about properties of inner structures by means of scaling methods   1   . this a l gorithm helps also the projectants of systems in the analysis of the system structure end their decomposition. an example show t h i s : for decomposing the orgenizatlonel structure of a production department the flow of information between units was determined by experts* this flow is set equal to the binding strength c   i   j   - the algorithm generated a p a r t i t i o n x with cost g x  = 1  the maximal possible value for g x  was 1. the analysis of these results show that the costs h i   a i  for each element 
a. are greater than 1. this means  that the flow of information between each element a. e a  to the subset a  is greater than tho flow of information between the element a. c a  to each other subset a . l l 	m 
the algorithm for the decomposition problem without restrictions is also a part of a program for the realization of the structure of a technical system. with this algorithm we determine the constituents of the system structure  1 . 
we tested the algorithm for the decompos i t i o n problem with restrictions on a variety of practical problems. to i l l u strate the power of the algorithm we give some s t a t i s t i c a l r e s u l t s : 
1. three different sets a of size 1 were partitioned. for each set a we computed with the algorithm four d i f ferent partitions x characterized by the following sets k:  1 1    1 1    1 1  and  1 1 . for each set k we also generated 1 random p a r t i t i o n s over a the main result is the following: in the mean with our algorithm we generate partitions with cost g x  1 % less than the cost of random p a r t i tions. the v a r i a b i l i t y coefficient of the distribution of the random partitions is 1  . 
1. a practical example with set a of size 1 is also computed  we generate partitions with k *  1 1  and 
k =  1 1 . for this problem we also generate analogous to point 1 a set of 1 random p a r t i t i o n s . in the mean our algorithm generates p a r t i tions with cost g x  1 % less than the cost of random p a r t i t i o n s . the v a r i a b i l i t y coefficient of the d i stribution of random partitions is 1 %. 
further results of this kind must be computed. 
this algorithm is also a part of a program for the placement of logical elements on double sided printed c i r c u i t boards. on figure 1 the structure of this program is given: 

on the basis of placements which we computed with this program the routing of a l l connections between positions on the board is possible with a routing program with 1 - 1 % 
conclusions 
the results show that the application of problem solving methods is one way in rationalization of design processes. the practical applications a re encouraging . in the future we are interested to find estimates of the probability for reaching extremal values of the cost g x  for such problems. in the past we r e s t r i c t e d our investigations on problems with only structural relationships between e l e ments a e a such as the number of connections  the flow of information and so on. from the point of view of e l e c t r i c a l and mechanical engineering the functional features of the elements a   a can not be neglected in the future. so we hope to go one step in the direction of automat i c a l l y solving synthesis problems as parts of design processes by means of problem solving methods.
