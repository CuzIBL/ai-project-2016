　　　　the goal of the nlg p r o j e c t is to enhance person-computer i n t e r a c t i o n by using more than one mode of communication. the p r o j e c t uses a combin a t i o n of n a t u r a l language and graphics f o r both i n p u t and o u t p u t . this allows development of p r a c t i c a l   h a b i t a b l e systems s u i t a b l e f o r users who are naive about programming  and encourages p r o d u c t i v e use of computers by more people. mixed g r a p h i c a l and l i n g u i s t i c i n t e r a c t i o n could be an important t o o l in a v a r i e t y of a p p l i c a t i o n areas. 
　　　　a p i l o t system  brown & kwasny  1  has been developed using an ag1 plasma panel screen f o r o u t p u t   and a touch panel and keyboard f o r  touches  and t e x t . o r g a n i z a t i o n of the system is h e t e r a r c h i c a l and based on i n t e r - m o d u l e message passing. the system is capable of drawing  e r a s i n g   and naming l i n e s   p o i n t s   or c i r c l e s   and of answering questions about screen o b j e c t s and system c a p a b i l i t i e s . a t y p i c a l dialogue might be  where  t  represents a p h y s i c a l touching of the screen : 
please draw a vertical 1 inch line here  t . put a point called fred here  t . 
make a circle with a ten cm diameter at fred 
connect fred and  1  
call the circle ball 
erase the line from fred erase fred 
call the 1 inch line bat. 
draw a circle name the circle face what did you draw here  t   
a line c a l l e d bat 
what can you draw  
lines  points  and circles is there a circle called face  
yes 
can you draw squares  
no 
　　　　one of the modules in the system is the language analyzer module  la . this module u t i l i z e s l e x i c a l and g r a p h i c a l input modules to form an i n put s t r i n g which is processed using an augmented t r a n s i t i o n network  atn  grammar  woods  1 . if necessary d u r i n g p r o c e s s i n g   la can r e t r i e v e stored knowledge using a question-answering  qa  f a c i l i t y embedded in the knowledge base module  kb . when language processing is completed  kb is passed the r e s u l t i n g case-based semantic s t r u c t u r e . using the mental package  shapiro  1   kb b u i l d s memory s t r u c t u r e s in a semantic network which is based on the work of brachman   the network has attached procedures which provide d e f a u l t v a l u e s   check net s t r u c t u r e s   and develop program-like s t r u c t u r e s which are passed to a graphics output module. a l l t e x t u a l responses output by the system are produced by a language generation module which uses an atn and templates. 
current research centers on language a n a l y -
s i s   knowledge r e p r e s e n t a t i o n and p r o t o c o l a n a l y s i s   but our i n t e r e s t s extend to system o r g a n i z a t i o n   language g e n e r a t i o n   g r a p h i c s   person-machine i n t e r a c t i o n   and the processing of drawn i n p u t . for l i n g u i s t i c i n p u t   a robust analyzer is being developed  based on a u n i f o r m model of s y n tax and semantics to handle both sentences which are grammatically acceptable and those which are n o t . a grammar is said to be complete in t h i s sense only when it accounts f o r every i n p u t p o s s i b i l i t y e x p l i c i t l y . 
       future knowledge base research w i l l concent r a t e on the homogeneous r e p r e s e n t a t i o n and manipu l a t i o n of many d i f f e r e n t types of i n f o r m a t i o n   such as s t r u c t u r a l   l e x i c a l   and f u n c t i o n a l . c u r r e n t l y   we are working on the process of ext r a c t i n g   from stored knowledge about an o b j e c t   t h a t i n f o r m a t i o n which w i l l a l l o w a p i c t u r e of the o b j e c t to be assembled and d i s p l a y e d . we r e q u i r e t h a t the r e p r e s e n t a t i o n should i n i t i a l l y be able to support both p i c t o r i a l and l i n g u i s t i c g e n e r a t i o n   and  e v e n t u a l l y   i n p u t in both modes as w e l l . 
       p r o t o c o l a n a l y s i s should lead us to discover adequate vocabulary and grammar and p r e f e r r e d modes of man-machine i n t e r a c t i o n   p a r t i c u l a r l y r a t i o s of g r a p h i c a l to language use and usage p a t t e r n s . some i n f o r m a t i o n about semantics can also be gathered by r e c o r d i n g user r e a c t i o n s to system responses. 
       we b e l i e v e t h a t w i t h a robust a n a l y z e r   mixed mode i n p u t and o u t p u t   and a powerful knowledge base  n a t u r a l language graphics w i l l provide a p r o d u c t i v e research and a p p l i c a t i o n s t o o l .
