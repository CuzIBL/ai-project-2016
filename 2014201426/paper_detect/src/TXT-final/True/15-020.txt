i introduction 
　　　in the legal domain  as in many others like mathematics  linguistics and computer science  examples are crucial to reasoning. in the law  cases play the role of examples; many of the examples considered are  hypothetical  as opposed to  real   that is cases that have been actually litigated. in particular it is the  fact situation   that i s   a short summary of the relevant facts of the case  that receives the most attention. this is especially true in legal education  for instance in standard courses like contracts  torts  c i v i l procedure and constitutional law  where hypothetical cases are used to explore doctrines and approaches  and to uncover students' assumptions and biases. hypotheticals are also important in legal scholarship and in legal codification   for instance as found in the restatement of contracts and restatement of torts  which are compendia of legal principles  illustrated and limited by sets of real and hypothetical cases. 
　　　it is interesting to compare the status of examples in the law and  in mathematics. in mathematics there is no distinction made between real and hypothetical examples - any example is as real or as make-believe as any other - unless one wants to single out examples that are used in proving a statement by assuming its negative. in fact  the notions of truth in these two fields are very different. in mathematics  truth is absolute and binary; what is true today will be true tomorrow. in the law  one deals with 
 quasi-truth ; truth is in the interpreting eye of the beholder  and even so  what is true today may be reversed tomorrow - for example  brown v. board of education in 1. in the law there is much more weight given to interpretation and adjudication in determining truth than in mathematics  although at some levels truth in

mathematics is not so black and white either  lakatos 1  davis 1  . 
　　　even so  in the law  hypotheticals   hypos   can in some contexts assume the status of real cases; for instance in the classroom where certain favorite reference exemplary hypos are treated like real cases. this is not so in legal practice  especially in common law systems like those of the united states and great britain  which rely heavily on the doctrine of precedent   stare decisis   . 
ii generating hypotheticals 
　　　given the importance of hypos  one is immediately led to ask  where do hypos come from   this question can be decomposed into two: 
1. what properties should the hypos have  and how are they determined  
1. how does one generate a hypo with the 	desired properties  
　　　to use the language of our previous research on examples  rissland 1  1  1   the first question is one of  constraint generation    and second of  constrained example generation   ceg   using the constraints resulting from answering the f i r s t . our paradigm of ceg actually provides a description of the hypo generation observed in law school classroom discussions. of special relevance to such hypos is the  modification  
component of ceg. 
our model can be summarized as follows: 
when presented with a task of generating an example that meets specified constraints  one: 
1. searches for and  possibly  retrieves examples judged to satisfy the constraints from an examples knowledge base  ekb ; or 
1. modifies existing examples judged to be close to  or having the potential for f u l f i l l i n g   the constraints with domain-specific modification operators; or 
1. constructs an example  for instance by instantiation of domain-specific models or templates  or by combining two existing examples from the ekb or by using other knowledge like definitions  principles  and heuristics from a domain knowledge base  dkb . 

retrieval  modification  and construction are usually attempted in that order; of course they 
may be combined with each other. 
　　　we have implemented this model and experimented with it in domains like mathematics 
 rissland and soloway  1b   tactical planning  wall and rissland 1   and elementary lisp programming  rissland and soloway 1a . 
	1ll 	sequences of hypos 
　　　in law school discussions  hypos often come in a sequence; that is a proposition or doctrinal position is enunciated and then explored by considering it on a sequence of cases. the proposition is then usually refined and the process repeats itself. this is much the same as the extended  proofs and refutation  style of concept and theory development in mathematics and other fields  lakatos 1  kuhn 1 . in classroom mathematics  however  emphasis is usually on one or two examples or counter-examples in response to a conjecture. in the law  the sequence of hypos usually starts with a  seed  case which is often a synopsis or simplified version of a studied  real  case. typically  one then performs a series of modifications starting from the seed case  to generate the hypos. usually it is just the fact situations of the cases that are being considered. 
　　　as an illustration  the following is a sequence of hypos taken from a discussion of intentionality from a f i r s t year course in torts. the purpose of the discussion was to contrast issues of  intent to harm   strong intentionality  with  intent to act   weak intentionality . the seed case is the real case of vosburg  v putney  gregory  kalvin and epstein 1   litigated at the appeals level in wisconsin in 1  in which the p l a i n t i f f   vosburg  aged fourteen at the time of the incident  sued the defendant  putney  aged twelve  to recover damages from injury which was caused by a kick inflicted by the defendant upon the leg of the p l a i n t i f f   a l i t t l e below the knee  and which occurred in a schoolroom during school hours. the opinion of the appeals court devoted 
much discussion to strong intention. 
　　　the class was asked to consider these ideas in the following hypos: 
ho: 	the original seed case 
h1: same as ho except that the defendant is a spastic  and therefore cannot control his actions terribly precisely. 
h1: same as ho except that the defendant runs down the classroon aisle and trips over p l a i n t i f f ' s outstretched leg  just after class has started. 
h 1 ; h1 except just before class is to start. h1: ho except that the incident happens in the playground. 
h1!: h1 with the addition that the incident happens while they were playing soccer. h1: ho with the addition that plaintiff wears a shinguard  since he is fearful of injury. 
	e. rissland 	1 
h1: h1  except that p l a i n t i f f does not get hurt. h1: ho with the addition that p l a i n t i f f ' s leg was to be amputated and the defendant's kick merely caused the amputation to occur two week earlier. 
h1: 	plaintiff is a hemophiliac 
　　　these hypos can be described in terms of the features modified: 
	h1 and h1: 	the class of the actors 
　　　h1: an attribute of an actor as well as the outcome; 
　　　h1 and h1': the sequence of events  specifically the time. 
	h1: 	the place of the event; 
　　　h1': h1 modified to deal with the context of the event. 
　　　the point is that by varying one or a few features of an example  one arrives at a new one. some of the hypos are very closely coupled: h1 and h1  h1 and h1  and h1 and h1' ; others are less so. the teacher  when asked about the ordering of the hypos  remarked that the order was not as important as making sure that the set of hypos spanned a variety of possible fact situations that would emphasize and illustrate the different doctrinal approaches and sympathies of the students. 
　　　this same phenomenon of seed example followed by sequence of hypos generated through modification can be seen throughout the standard law courses. for instance  in discussing in personem and quasi in rem jurisdiction  in which the issue is whether a court has jurisdiction over an individual by virtue of his being in or owning property in a state  a c i v i l procedures course was presented with the following sequence of hypos in rapid succession.* 
　　　h1: i own an undeveloped tract of land in new hampshire. 
h1: h1 + never go there and never pay taxes. 
h1: h1 	except pay taxes. h1: hi 	+ make 	improvements to 	l a n d . h1: h1 	+ b u i l d a c a b i n and never go t h e r e ; h1: h1 + r e n t 	it o u t . h1: h1 + let friends use i t . h1: h1 except spend two weeks a year there. 　　　note that in our description of the hypo sequence in terms of modifications  there is often more than one way to describe the generation of the hypo. for instance  h1 can also be described like h1 as a modification of hi. these relations among the hypos of  constructed from modification  allow description of the hypos as an  examples-space  of examples  as nodes  and modifications  as labelled arcs   rissland 1 . 
　　　in summary  one can frequently analyze sequences of hypos  such as found in classroom 
*in the seed case  pennoyer v. neff  cound  friedenthal and miller 1  pennoyer was served with process even though he was a non-resident of the state.

socratic discussion at law school  as consisting of a seed example and a sequence of subsequent examples generated by modifications; the modifications are made to various features of the examples such as time and place attributes. construction also occurs  but in our observations much less frequently than modification. 
iv constraint generation 
　　　it is an interesting and complex question how one decides what one wants in a hypo. the constraints often come from pedagogical goals  like when a teacher carries a sequence of hypos to an extreme in small steps  in what is known as  sliding down the slippery slope   in order to show how a doctrine  legal rule or personal bias can allow results that are clearly undesirable   false  or  at least  controversial. this approach resembles the  reductio ad absurdum  familiar to all mathematicians. 
　　　from empirical data on hypos  one can distinguish several broad types of constraints: 
1. general constraints  like those affecting time   place   actor   or generality; 
1. rhetorical constraints  like those affecting salience and order in hypos; 
1. pedagogical constraints  like those on extreme cases; 
1. common sense constraints  like those about people  occupations  property ownership; 
1. domain-specific doctrinal constraints on the legal content  like intentional torts or in personem jurisdiction. 
　　　which constraints are placed on the hypo clearly depends on the goal of the teacher or the arguer   as well as on the context in which it is to be used. the intertwining of proposition and example in legal argument and dialog is very like that in mathematics proofs and refutation and in other domains  swartout and balzer 1 . how the constraints are determined is a subject of current research. 
v implementing ceg for legal hypos 
	to apply the ceg model and use 	the 	existing 
ceg system for generating legal hypos  one must describe the following domain-specific knowledge: 
1. the structure of the examples; 
1. the attributes of the examples to be constrained and modified; 
1. the criteria for judging satisfaction 	of 	the constraints; 
1. the modification procedures. 
　　　we use a frame-based representation for the examples with slots and attached procedures for describing an example's attributes  lisp functions to specify judgment criteria and modification procedures. the judgment and modification

	vi 	conclusion 
       in t h i s paper .we have discussed the problem o f generating examples  s p e c i f i c a l l y h y p o t h e t i c a l s   in the law. we have broken t h i s problem i n t o two components: one of generating the c o n s t r a i n t s on the examples from c o n s i d e r a t i o n of contextual f a c t o r s such as the propostion being argued; and one of then generating the example t h a t s a t i s f i e s the c o n s t r a i n t s . for the second  we have applied our previous work on constrained example g e n e r a t i o n . here we have found t h a t our 
model and a n a l y s i s can be used for generating hypos in standard l e g a l s u b j e c t s l i k e t o r t s and c o n t r a c t s ; we b e l i e v e t h a t it w i l l be useful in others as w e l l . we have also noted t h a t there are many s i m i l a r i t i e s among  and some i n t e r e s t i n g d i f f e r e n c e s between  the use of example generation 
in 	the 	law and 	other 	f i e l d s l i k e mathematics.
