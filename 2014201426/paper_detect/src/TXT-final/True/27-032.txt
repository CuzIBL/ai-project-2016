this paper concerns how to generate and understand discourse anaphoric noun phrases  or noun phrases  nps  that evoke a discourse entity already in the discourse model  webber   dale   implements gncean constraints on informativeness for generating discourse anaphoric nps however his model follows the tradition of assuming that distinct constraints govern pronouns versus phrasal nps  cf  reichman 1   grosz and sidner  1   centering    a model of local attentional state   has been applied primarily to definite pronouns i argue that gncean constraints should be applied equally to discourse anaphoric pronouns and phrasal nps  and that integrating centering and informational constraints covers a broader range of cases in 뫫1  i present an analysis of all discourse anaphoric nps  n=l 1  in a corpus of ten narratives showing that semantic explicitness depends largely on informational constraints discourse anaphoric nps almost never provide new information and are rarely more informative than necessary in 뫫1  i show how dale a: reiter's  to appear  generation model can be augmented to apply uniformly to pronouns and phrasal nps for both generation and understanding while centering has been 
 the work reported here was not supported by bellcore 
used to account for informationally under-specified pronouns  i argue that centering also accounts for certain over-specified phrasal nps in 뫫1  i integrate centering with the augmented gncean model and discuss the extended coverage results in $1 include a one-way correlation of overly informative discourse anaphoric nps with shifts in global discourse structure in the conclusion  i discuss directions for extending the integrated model in wavs that might indirectly account for this correlation 
1 	analysis of a coded corpus 
in this section i present the results of an analysis of all discourse anaphoric nps in a corpus of spoken narratives directed at the question of how informative nps are  relative to their contexts of occurrence the first subsection describes the corpus and coding features the next subsection presents results showing that discourse anaphoric nps in the corpus  whether pronominal or phrasal are rarely more informative than necessary  and if so  tend to occur at shifts in global discourse structure 
모fig 1 identifies four possibilities regarding the semantic informativeness of an np relative to its context three of them pertain to the following gncean principles  referred to by dale  as informational adequacy and efficiency the speaker should be sufficiently informative to unambiguously identify the intended referent  adequacy   and the speaker should be no more informative than necessary  efficiency  the boxed pronouns in  1a  of fig 1 are both adequate and efficient  well-specified  it is clear what the pronouns refer to less informative forms  zero pronouns  would be ungrammatical the phrasal nps in  1b  are adequate bul not efficient  over-specified  the pronominal np in  1c  is inadequate  under-specified  efficiency does not apply to inadequate nps  ''it'' could refer either to the ladder or the tree a fourth possibility is that an np may perform two functions  to identify the referent and to add information about it  as in  1d   over-determmed  in fig 1  the feature +/- increasing distinguishes between over-determined and over-specified nps 
1 	data coding 
the corpus consists of ten narrations from chafe s pear stories  chafe recorded and transcribed subjects who had been asked to view the same movie and describe 
	passonneau 	1 

it to a second person the movie contained seven sequential episodes about a man picking pears it had a vivid sound track  but no language as part of a long term study of the relationship between linguistic features and discourse structure  passonneau and litman  1   litman and passonneau  1b   litman and passonneau  1a   discourse anaphoric nps in the corpus had alreadv been coded for coreference relations and location location of an np is represented here in terms of the containing sentential utterance and discourse segment as described below fig 1 illustrates an excerpt 

figure 1 narrative excerpt illustrating informativeness 
모cbafe  identified three types of prosodic phrases from graphic displays of intonation contours a period indicates a phrase terminated by a pitch fall a question mark indicates final level or rising pitch and a comma indicates phrase final-not sentence final-intonation the transcriptions here show all repeated and incomplete words and phrases non-lexical articulations such as uh  urn  tsk   and vowel lengthening as indicated by - pause locations are shown as ' ps ' 
모sentential utterances are defined be a non-overlapping sequence of units that completely covers the discourse briefly  a new sentential utterance begins with a functionally independent clause  fic  if it is immediately adjacent to the preceding fic otherwise it begins at the onset of the prosodic phrase where the next fic begins an ftc is a tensed clause that is not a verb argument  a restrictive relative clause  or one of a set of formulaic  interjection  clauses  e g     you know with no clausal argument  for full details cf ipassonneau  1   material between clauses includes sentence or word fragments  and non-lexical articulations  e g    um    locations and sequence numbers of the seven sentential utterances in 
fig 1 are shown in column 1 
모the global context is structured into sequential segments  multi-utterance units whose utterances are presumed to be more related to one another semantically 
1 	natural language 
and pragmatically than to other utterances the segments numbered 1  col 1 of fig 1  were derived from an empirical study described in  passonneau and litman  1  each narrative was segmented by 1 new  untrained subjects subjects were instructed to place 
segment boundaries in transcripts whenever the narrator had finished one communicative task and begun a new one they were restricted to placing boundaries between prosodic phrases to focus their attention on the criterion  subjects' were also instructed to label segments with a brief description of the speaker's intention 
모the size and number of segments per subject per narrative varied widely  from a rate of 1% to 1%  avg =1%  with segment widths ranging from 1 to 1 phrases  avg =1  despite this variation  the number of times 1 to 1 subjects assigned boundaries in the same place was extremely significant  using cochran's q   cf  passonneau and litman  1   we took agreement among at least 1 subjects as the threshold for 
empiricall  validated boundaries 
모a surface constituent is considered to be a discourse anaphoric np if it occurs in free variation with syntactically prototypical nps and corefers with a preceding np  cf  passonneau  1   one type of empty category is also included  namely zero pronoun subjects of fics conjoined by   ' 'and  etc in fig 1 the sequence of cortferential nps used to refer to the little boy are coindexed segments 1 and 1 in fig 1 both begin with an utterance containing an np referring to the boy at the onset of segment 1  a phrasal np is used to refer to him  u1  whereas at the onset of segment 1  u1  a definite pronoun is used but a pronoun could have replaced the phrasal np in u1 with no loss of information so the phrasal np is over-specified but not over-determined  the attributes boy  and  'little' were already mentioned in u1 the pronoun subject in u1 is locally well-specified because the boy is the only animate entity mentioned in u1 it is globally well-specified because the boy is the only entity in the discourse with a bicycle 
1 	analysis of i n f o r m a t i o n a l constraints 
the goal of the analysis is to determine whether relative informativeness of nps correlates with global discourse structure  cf  reichman  1   grosz and sidner 1   any phrasal np that is discourse anaphoric is potentially over-specified  whereas a definite pronoun will only be over-specified if a zero pronoun could have been used i first sorted the discourse anaphoric nps in the corpus  n = 1  into the three categories of phrasal nps  phrnps  n=1  explicit pronouns  pros definite  indefinite  demonstrative  n=1   and zero pronominals  zps n=1  then i identified all pairs of coindexed nps where np1 was more explicit than np  this procedure identified 1 discourse anaphoric nps in the corpus that were potentially overspecified or over-determined the sole over-determined np  illustrated in fig 1  occurs relatively late in the narrative   u 1     it seems mainly to provide contrast  cf  that old man' vs those little boys   
모potentially over-specified nps were sorted into four mutually exclusive categories-well-specified  segment 


onset attentional shift  and reiterative a potentially over-specified np is well-specified if a less explicit form would have been ambiguous or unclear the containing utterance is included in the context since the proposition expressed in an utterance can disambiguate a referring expression a potentially over-specified np that is not well specified but which occur*  in the first utterance of a new segment  is classified as. a segment onset the segments in the coded pear corpus arguably contain intra 
segmental shifts of attention associated with changes in lemporal aspect  or shifts in discourse reference time  for definitions assumed here of  karneyama et al 1   ihe third category  attentional shift consists of these cases a fourth catch-all category includes e g   repetitions repairs  contrastive nps and unexplained cases 
모table 1 indicates that most potentially over-specified nps  n=1  were either well-specified  1%  or occur at an empirically verified segment onset  1%  or a hypothesized attentional shift  1%  of the 1 nps whose nearest antecedent was in a distinct segment  1% occurred at a segment onset over a third   1%  of the nps whose antecedent was in the same segment and 
1% of those whose antecedent was in a distinct segment occurred at an intra-segmental attentional shift in sum in the coded pear corpus  nps that re-evoke existing en titles seem to be rarely over-specified  1 or 1%  or over-determined  1  of the 1 over-specified cases  columns 1   1  1%  correlate with segment onsets independently identified by naive subjects  and 1  1%  appear to correlate with intra-segmental attentional shifts thus  an over-specified np is more likely than not to correlate with an attentional shift  1%  note however  that the reverse implication does- not hold  that is it is not the case that a segment shift is likely to be signalled by an over-specified np 
1 	focused a t t r i b u t e sets 
to account for the choice of modifiers m phrasal dis course anaphoric nps  it is necessary to determine how attributes are selected from the information known about a discourse entity according to grices s  maxim of quality  speakers should be relevant with respect to discourse anaphoric nps in the pear stones 

np modifiers are derived from what i refer to as focussed attribute sets  independent of whether the np is overspecified focussed attribute sets comprise the following three categories of relevance first an attribute set can he in focus because it was mentioned in the most recent phrasal np for example  in fig 1  the boy is referred to in u1 as the little boy ' repeating attributes mentioned in the last phrasal np referring to the boy  in u1  
모second  the focussed attribute set may specify the most recently mentioned location of an entity the sub-
ject np in u1 of fig 1  뫫1  refers to one man as ' the man up in the tree to distinguish him from the second 
man who came by with a goat the free is the last mutually known location of the former finally an attribute set can be in focus hecause it pertains to a key narrative event that the entity has been an agent of intuitively  an event is more central to a narrative the more difficult it is to describe the narrative without mentioning that event operationally  key events occur more frequently than others both within and across narratives tor example  the main adult character is often described as  the pear picker or as ihe man who was picking pears  see u1 of fig 1 뫫1   and so on the other main character is often described as ihe thief  the boy who stole the pears the boy tilth the pears  and so on 
모how to order the focussed attribute sets for a given discourse entity is a topic for further investigation here i simply assume that the three types of attribute sets mentioned above-where applicable-are in focus i also assume that the focussed attribute sets of an en-
tit   fave  are updated as the discourse progresses 
1 	modelling informativeness of n p s 
 the  data reported above indicates that in the pear corpus definite pronouns and phrasal nps are rarely overspecified or over-determined in this section  1 describe a processing model to account for this observation in the next section 1 discuss how centering can be integrated with this model to account for under-specified pronouns  and certain over-specified phrasal nps first 1 briefly review dale s   model including his morecent work with reiter  to appear  then 1 modify this model to apply to understanding as well as generation to include the current utterance in  he context of evaluation to apply informational constraints uniformly lo pronouns and phrasal nps and to select modifiers on the bails of focused attribute-value pairs 
1 	distinguishing descriptions 
dale  generates anaphoric pronouns and phrasal 
nps by distinct means in epicure   a system for generating recipes  a definite pronoun is always genprated to refer to the discourse center which is analogous to the backward-looking center of  grosz et al 1   kamey ama  1  but is domain specific it it  the entity that results from the nev;t recipe operation for example  rice1 will be the center after an utterance of stir the rice1 
모dale  requires phrasal nps to be distinguishing descriptions as in webber   dale assumes that the discourse mode  represents the discourse entities that 
	passonneau 	1 


	1 	natural language 

as the attribute-value pairs   type human   gender male    cardinahty 1    not only describes e1 it is also a minimal distinguishing description 
모an analogous process applies to understanding the same pronoun in u1  with the entity variable e uninstantiated np instantiated to he and the utterance and discourse context instantiated as above given a distinguishing description there is guaranteed to be exactly one solution to e however  the starch problem increases with the size of the context partitioning the search space into focus spaces controls the search through the discourse model to some degree  integrating centering with c-describe as described below guides the search e en further   for present purpose  c-describe returns e in-
stantiated to c1 after searching through the entities in fsi the remaining n ps excinplified d here are understood in a similar fashion 
모given a context where there is no dehnite pronoun solution to np c.describe will attempt to construct a phrasal np  preferably with no modifiers in fig a a new  singular male human entity is added to the context at us a boy who come s by on a bicycle  e1   subse quenl
