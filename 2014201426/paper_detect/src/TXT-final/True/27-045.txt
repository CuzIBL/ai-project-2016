1 	introduction 
this work is part of the project that amih at a svner gistic integration of machine learning and natural language processing the long-t  rm goal of the project is a system that performs machine learning on the results of text analysis to acquire a useful collection of production rules because such a svstem should not require extensive domain knowledge up front  text analysis is to be dont in a knowledge-scant setting and with mm imal user involvement a domain-independent surfacesyntactic parser produces an analysis of a text fragment 
 usually a sentence  that undergoes interactive semantic

interpretation by design we only need the user to approve the system s findings or prompt it for alternatives also hy design we limit ourselves to information source* in the public domain inexpensive dictionaries and other lexical sources such as wordnet 
　wordnel  mill* r  1 beckwith et al   1  is a very rich source of lexical knowledge since most entries have multiple senses  we fare a severe problem of ambiguity the motivation for the work described here is the desire to design a word sense disambiguation  wsd  algorithm that satisfies the needs of our project  learning from text  without large amounts of hand-crafted knowledge or statistical data from large corpora we concentrate on using information in wordnet to the fullest extent and minimizing the need for other knowledge sources in the wsd algorithm semantic similarity between words  defined in the next section  plays an important role in the algorithm we propose several heuristic rules to guide wsd icsted on an unrestricted  real text  the canadian income tax guide  this automatic wsd method gives encouraging results 
　word sense disambiguation is essential in natural language processing early symbolic methods  hirst  1  small and rieger 1  wilks  1  heavily rely on large amounts of hand-crafted knowledge as a reault  they can only work in a specific domain to overcome this weakness a variety of statistical wsd methods 
 brown et a/  1  gale et a/  1  resnik  1  schutze  1 charniak  1  lehman  1  have been put forward they scale up easily and this makes them useful for large unrestricted corpora one of the most important steps in statistical wsd methods  however  is statistically motivated extraction of word-word relationships from corpora as resnik points out   the corpus may fail to provide sufficient information about relevant word/word relationships and word/word relationships  even those supported by the data  may not be the appropriate relationships to look at for some tasks  most of the statistical methods suffer from this limitation resnik proposes constraining the set of possible word classes by using wordnet rather than improving statistical approaches  resnik  1  sussna  1  voorhees  1  we propose a completely different wordnet-based algorithm for wsd 
1 	wordnet and semantic similarity 
wordnet is a lexical database with a remarkably broad coverage one of its most outstanding qualities is a word sense network a word sense node in this network is a group of strict synonyms called synset' which is regarded as a basic object in wordnet each sense of a word is mapped to such a word sens*  node  1 e 
a synset  in wordnet and all word sense nodes in wordnet are linked by a  anety of semantic relationships  such as is-a  hypernymy/hyponymy  part-of 
 meronymy/holonymy   synonymy and antonymy the is-a relationship is dominant - synsels are grouped by it into hicrarchies our algorithm only accesses information about nouns and verbs  for which thtre exist such lexical hierarchies 
　it has become common to use some messure of semantic similarity between words to support word sense disambiguation  resmk 1  schutze  1  in this work  we have adopted the following defintion semantic similarity between words is inverselv proportional  o the semantic distance between words in a wordnet is a hierarchy by investigating the semantic relationships between two given words in wordnet hierarchies semantic similarity can be measured and roughly divided into the following four levels 
level 1 the words are strict synonynis according to wordnet one word is in the same synset as the other word 
level 1 the words are extended synonyms according to wordnet one word is the immediate parent node of the other word in a is-a hierarchy of wordnet when used to get the synonyms of a word  wordnet not only produces the strict synonyms  a synset   but also the immediate parent nodes of this synset in a is-a hierarchy of wordnet here  these immediate parent nodes are called extended synonyms 
level 1 tht words are hyponyms according to wordnet one word is a child node of the other word in a is-a hierarchy of wordnet 
level 1 the words have a coordinate relationship in wordnet a word is a sibling node of the other word 
 i e both words have tht same parent node  m a is-a hierarchy of wordnet 
　level 1 concerns the semantic similarity between words inside a synset  level 1 - level 1 describe the semantic similarity between words that  belong to different synsets  a synset which is composed of a group of strict synonyms is a node in the hierarchy of wordnet  the semantic similarity at level 1 and level 1 are symmet ric  but the semantic similarity at level 1 and level 1 are not symmetric although both are about the relation between a word in a child synset and a word in its parent synset in wordnet  a parent synset is considered as  extended synonyms  of its immediate child synset  but a child synset is not a synonym of its immediate child synset at all for example  a parent aynset possession' is an  extended synonym  of its immediate child synset  property  belonging  holding  material possession  but a child synset property belonging  holding  material possession  is not a synonym of its immediate parent svnset 'possession  at all using the information about a parent synset to decide the intended meaning of a word in its immediate child svnset is different from using the information about a child synset to decide the intended meaning of a word in its immediate parent synset so here we have divided the semantic similarity between a parent synset and its immediate child synset into two levels  level 1 and level 1  
　although we have only applied the algorithm to wsd of noun objects in a text  i e nouns that are objects of verbs in sentences analyzed by  the system   it can also be applied to other noun phrases in a sentence  in particular subjects 
　in this approach  we must consider contexts that are relevant lo our method and tht semantic similarity in 
these contexts 
　tor all practical purposes  the possible senses of a word can be found in wordnet  but due to its extremely broad coverage most words have multiple word senses a context must be considered in order to decide a particular word sense the notion of context and its use could differ widely across wsd methods one may consider a whole text  a 1-word window  a sentence or some 
specific words nearby  and so on in our work  we assume that a group of words co-occurring in a sentence will determine earh other s sense despite each of them being multiply ambiguous a simple and effective way is lo consider as context the verbs that dominate noun objects in sentences that is  we investigate verb-noun pairs to determine tht intended meaning of noun objects in sentences 
　in this work  then we focus on investigating two aspects of semantic similarity 
  the semantic similarity of the noun objects 
  the semantic similarity of their verb contexts 
1 	h e u r i s t i c r u l e s a n d c o n f i d e n c e of 
r e s u l t s 
we have set out to determine the intended meaning of a noun object in a given verb context from all candidate word senses in wordnet of the noun object  select one sense that best fits the given verb context 
　suppose that the algorithm seeks the intended meaning of a noun object nobj in its verb context vc  that is  the intended meaning of nobj in a verb-object pair 
 vc  nobj   nobj has n candidate word senses in wordnet s k  means the kth word sense of nobj in wordnet  l k n ss means the semantic similarity between words in a is-a hierarchy of wordnet an arrow is used to describe the relationship between words or between a word and its word sense the heuristic rules adopted in the wsd algorithm are as follows 
heuristic rule 1   h r l   search the text for a verb-object pair  vc  nobj   in which nobj has the semantic similarity with a word sense of nobj in wordnet and then consider this word sense of nobj as a result  see fig 1 and the txample in 
	li szpakowicz andmatwin 	1 

figure 1 principle of heuristic hrl 
heuristic rule 1  hr1  search the text for a verbobject pair  vc nobj  in which vc has the semantic similarity with vc if the word sense of nobj in verb context vc has already been acquired  then consider this word sense as a result  see fig 1 and the example in step 1 of the wsd 
algorithm  

heuristic rule 1  hr1  search the text for a verb object pair  vc   nobj   in which vc ha* the semantic similarity with vc and nobj' has the  e mantic similarity with a word sense of nobj in wordnet then consider this word sense as a result  see fig 1 and the example in step 1 and step 1 of the wsd algorithm  
　obviously hr1 is not always feasible and it just contributes to the inference of further results based on the previously acquired results hr1 infers results with a weaker constraint on the semantic similarity between verb-object pairs hr1 is the main heuristic rule in the algorithm 
　besides the heuristic rules based on the semantic similarity between verb-object pairs special heuristic rules related to the syntactic structure have also been formulated to assibt word sense disambiguation  see  grefenstette and hearst  1  for a similar approach 
1 	natural language 
heuristic rule 1  hr1  search the text for a  such as  structure which follows the verb-object pair  vc  nobj  in the text the object nobj' of such as  certainh has a synonym or hyponym relationship with a word sense of nobj in wordnet then consider this word sense as a result  sec fig 1 and the example in si ep 1 of the wsd algorithm in the next section  

heuristic rule 1  hr1  search the text for a vp coordinate structure such as either 'vc and vc ' or 'vc or vc   which has the noun object nobj if the word sense of nobj in the verb context vc has already been acquired  then consider this word sense as a result  see fig 1 and the example in step 1 of the wsd algorithm  
　hr1 only aims at one kind of special cases and its coverage is limited hr1  like hr1  also depends on previously acquired results  but its coverage is more limited 
　because the results acquired by applying different heuristic rules have different accuracy  we have to define the measure of confidence in the result   cf  for short  according to different heuristic rules and different semantic similarity adopted in these rules in our algorithm  the assignment of cf values intuitively corresponds to our notion of decreasing semantic similarity  the test of the viability of this intuitive assignment has been shown in section 1  the cf values are numbers between 1 and 1 the assignment of cf values to levels is arbitrary  but it has served us well so far because

step 1 
find in the parsed text a verb-object pair  wv   wn  in which wv has a synonymv  hyponvmy or coordinate relationship with wv and the word sense of wn in its verb context wv has already been acquired  suppose it is sense  wn  k  1  k n  the meaning of wn in its verb context wv is also sense wn  k  the confidence in this result is 1 
for example suppose wn = ' contribution' and wv - ' prorate' ' contribution  has 1 senses m wordnet a verb-object pair ' calculate contribution can be found in the text and ' calculate has a synonym relationship with ' prorate the meaning of ' contribution in its verb context calculate has already been acquired  it is sense  contnbution  1  see the example in step 1  the meaning of 'contribution' in its verb context  prorate' is also sensse  contribution  1  
step 1 
find in the parsed text a verb-objec  pair  wv wn   in which wv has a synonymy  hyponymy or coordinate relationship with wv and wn has a synonym or hvponvm relationship with sense wn  k  l k n the meaning of wn in its verb context wv is sense wn k  the confidence in this result is 1 
for example  suppose wn = 	 deduction' 	and wv = 
'calculate' ' deduction  have seven senses in wordnet a verb-object pair  subtract allowance  can be found in the tfxt  subtract' is svnonvmous with calculate  and ' allowance  is synonymous with sense deduction  i   this slum is given as ' an amount or percentage de-
ducted 	the meaning of  deduction in its verb context 
calculate is sense deduction 1  
step 1 
the taint as step 1 but with a coordinate relationship instead of synon or hyponymv between wn and sense wn  k  l k n the confidence in this re 
suit is 1 
for example  wn = investment' and wv =  list' investment has 1 senses in wordnet a verb-object pair enter credit can be found in the text ' enter has a coordinate relationship with ' list  and credit has a 
coordinate relationship with sense investment 1   this sense is given as any valuable or useful possession' the meaning of investment in its verb context  list' is sense investment 1  
step 1 
find in the parsed text a 'such as  structure that follows the verb-object pair  wv  wn  in the text and the object wn of this  such as  structure is synonymous or hyponymous with sense wn  k    k n the meaning of wn in its verb context wv is sense wn  k  the confidence in this result is 1 
for example  suppose wn = ' property ' and wv = 'sell   property' has 1 senses in wordnet a structure  such as real estate  can be found in the text which follows 'sell property  in the text  that is    sell property  such as real estate     and the object  real estate  of this 'such as  structure is hyponymous with sense property  1   this sense is given as  any tangible possession that is owned by someone  the meaning of ' property in its verb context  sell  is sense property  
1  
step 1 
find in the parsed text a coordinate verb phrase struc ture wv and wv   or  wv or wv' ' whose noun object is wn and the meaning of wn in its verb context wv has alreadv been acquired  suppose it is sense wn  k  l k n  the meaning of wn in its verb context wv is also sense wn  k  the confidence in this result is the same as for the verb context wv' 
for example  suppose wn =  property  and wv =  dispose or  property' has 1 senses in wordnet in the text a vp coordinate structure dispose of or sell whose noun object is propertv' has been found  that is there is dispose of or sell property   in the text  and the meaning of 'property ' in its verb context  sell  
has already been acquired  it is sense propertv  1  with the confidence 1  see the example in step 1   then the meaning of  property  in its verb context  dispose of is also sense property  1  the confidence in this result is also 1 
1 	evaluation 
the wsd algorithm has been implemented in prolog and tested on the canadian income tax guide this text contains 1 sentences in which there are 1 different verb-object pairs these pairs employ 1 different noun-objects  so the average noun-object appears in the text in more than three verb contexts there are 1 noun-objects which have three or more verb contexts in the text among such 1 noun-objects  1 noun-objects have more than one sense in wordnet 
　we have carried out a post hoc evaluation of the results  based on a manual assessment of the algorithm's output another approach  which we intend to use in further tests of the wsd algorithm in addition to post hoc analysis  is to mark nouns in a portion of text in advance and measure the number of matches 
　the evaluation of the wsd algorithm has been done on a test of 1 cases we determined the intended meanings of 1 noun-objects in 1 different verb contexts the wsd program may give five possible results 
one correct solution - one reasonable meaning of the noun object has been selected by the wsd algorithm 
for example  for the pair  report loss   only one sense among 1 candidate word senses in wordnet  sense loss  1   has been selected by the wsd algorithm as the intended meaning of  loss  in the verb context  report  
sense 1 
loss -  failure to retain possession   the company 

1 	natural language 

wrote off its losses   
=  transferred property  transferred possession 
correct multiple solutions - more than one reasonable meaning of the noun object has been selected by the wsd algorithm because some verbs cannot put strong restrictions on their objects  it is possible that several word senses of a noun object are all reasonable in the verb context 
for example  for the verb-object claim charge'   among 1 candidate word senses in wordnet  two word senses of  charge' have been selected by the algorithm as the intended meaning of charge in the verb context 'claim' sense charge  1  and 
sense charge  1  in fact  both are reasonable in the verb context claim 
sense 1 
charge -  a financial liability  such as a tax  - liability financial obligation  indebtedness pecuniary obligation 
sense 1 charge  the price charged for some article or service  
=  cost price  terms  damage 
partially correct solutions - more than one word sense of the noun object has been selected by the wsd algorithm among those it least  there is the correct word sense that is reasonable in the verb context 
for example for  he verb-object pur ' attach receipt among three candidate word senses two word senses of ' receipt have been selected by the wsd algorithm as the intended meaning of 'receipt in the verb context' attach  sense  receipt -1  
and sense receipt 1  in fac  only sense receipt  1  is reasonable in the verb context attach' 
sense 1 
receipt  acknowledgment  acknowledgement 
=  commercial document commercial instrument 
sense 1 
reception receipt  receiving -  the act of receiving  =  acquisition  acquiring  taking 
wrong solution the meanings of the noun object selected by the wsd algorithm are unreasonable for its verb context 
no solution no result has been acquired by the algorithm for some cases  if no relev ant information for supporting the wsd process of these cases can be found in the text  e g there is no sufficient information in the text   the algorithm would not produce any solution 
　the following statistical data have been obtained by running the wsd program to deal with the 1 cases 

this test result for the wsd algorithm is encouraging with human's assessment  the word sense disambiguation has a high accuracy of up lo 1%  one correct solution and correct multiple solutions  among the remaining 1% cases  there are only 1% wrong solutions the 1% cases with partially correct solutions show how word sense ambiguity has been improved bv the wsd algorithm 
　of course  on the other hand  with 1% correct multiple solution cases this wsd algorithm is obviously limited in these cases  a verb context  for example  include or ' have is not strong enough to limit the multiple word senses of its noun object to the only intended meaning in addition  even for some singlesolution cases the only intended meaning obtained by the algorithm is suitable in the verbal context considered by our algorithm  but is not necessarily appropriate for the whole text in order to produce the only intended meaning of the noun objects in the whole text  contexts other than just the verb context should be exploited in the future versions of our algorithm 
   there are 1% no-solution cases in the test this means that 1 background verb-object pairs in the text are not sufficient to support word sense disambiguation of these cases the wsd algorithm depends on the relevant information in a text  so the more relevant information in the text the better the wsd result if a text is short of relevant information for supporting wsd process  a good idea is that instead of using relevant information from the text  the wsd algorithm works based on some supporting information from a large corpus  that is  with a large amount of verb-object pairs from a large corpus as its background knowledge  
　the sensitivity of results to the specific setting of cfs used has been noticed in the experiment as well the following results indicate that indeed the quality decreases with the decreasing values although mavbe the actual setting could be changed as long as its values are in roughly the same decreasing order for hr1 - hr1

values in the wsd algorithm is quite acceptable 
1 	conclusions 
in this paper  we have presented a wordnet-based algorithm for word sense disambiguation the algorithm is designed to support text analysis with minimal precoded knowledge although the algorithm is assumed to aim at word sense disambiguation of noun objects in a text  in fact it can be easily transformed to cover some other parts of speech in a text 
　the approach focuses on two parts the full utilization of the important relationships between words in wordnet and the exploration of wsd heuristic rules based on the semantic similarity between words the experiment described here demonstrates the viability of the wsd algorithm  the rationality of the confidence value assignment and show the potential of a wordnet-based method the experiment also shows the limitations of considering only verb contexts in the wsd process 
　future work on wsd will focus on investigating the possibility of the involvement of more complex context in the wsd process and considering the effective combination between the current result with verb contexts and the possible future result with some other contexts
