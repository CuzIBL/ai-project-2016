 
an adaptive-control procedure is described which is intended to improve both acoustic analysis and linguistic decoding in automatic recognition of continuous speech by bringing into agreement data available at each of these stages. specifically  hypotheses are formed by the decoder concerning the phonetic transcription derived during acoustic analysis. the procedure then accesses and u t i l i z e s relevant acoustic data in an attempt to verify or reject these hypotheses. depending on the success of such attempts  actions are taken to constrain the decoding in subsequent processing iterations. 
preliminary 	results 	are 	presented 	and discussed. 
introduction 
　　　the work to be described here concerns one aspect of a larger e f f o r t   the objective of which is to make inroads toward pragmatic solutions for the very d i f f i c u l t problems involved in automatic recognition of continuous speech  arcs   1 1 . the strategy which has been employed is one in which no attempt is made to model human processing in true analog form  1 . the model generated consists of hierarchically arranged  essentially independent stages concerned with signal quantization  subword segmentation  acoustic classification and linguistic decoding. 
　　　the present topic is an adaptive-control mechanism intended to improve both the acoustic analyzer and linguistic decoder outputs by bringing into agreement data available at each of these stages. in our work the automatic mechanism which performs this verification task is referred to as the linguistic-processor feedback stage  or adaptive controller  of an automatic speech recognition system. earlier work concerned with this particular u t i l i z a t i o n of adaptive control has been reported previously  1 1 . the use of adaptive control in the interaction of successive stages in systems of this sort is certainly not new  and has also been tentatively studied in this system relative to the segmentation and classification stages  1 . 
　　　since the data presented here represent a larger set of utterances than hitherto processed by the linguistic decoder  the results are more representative than those previously reported. this was made possible primarily by the increased processing speed of an ibm/1  mod 1 as compared to a mod 1  on which the system was developed. also  for purposes of c l a r i t y   relevant processing performed on an example utterance w i l l be presented. this should enable readers who are unfamiliar with this system to obtain at least an overview of the ideas behind the main processing stages. the procedures particularly related to this study are described in d e t a i l   whereas other procedures are described only b r i e f l y . obviously  length restrictions preclude the possibility of giving a detailed description of a l l aspects of the system. further descriptive information on the most recent version of this speech recognition system can be found in ref. 1. 
procedures 
　　　a block diagram of the speech recognition system under consideration here is presented in fig. 1. the acoustic processor performs signal quantization  subword segmentation and acoustic classification. the input to the acoustic classifier consists of a sequence of d i g i t a l spectral time samples  sts   one every 1 ms  with time-aligned phonetic-class boundary indicators  fig. 1 . these boundary indicators generally f a l l within what are usually considered the apparent phonetic states  nodes . 
acoustic classifier 
　　　classification consists of steady-state and dynamic classification  node consolidation and anchor-point placement. spectral correlations are performed for each 
sts  fig. 1 ; for any sts they are simply the five highest correlations  in percent  of that sts with each of a set of referent classes. this set roughly corresponds to the broad phonetic classes of general american english. for a boundary sts  steady-state classification consists of the spectral correlations at that point in time. dynamic classification is concerned with labeling the inter-boundary regions relative to a set of stored classes. the subword segments so defined relate to the transition from phonetic state to neighboring phonetic state  and are referred to as  transemes.  the dynamic-classification output is represented as a rank-ordered  five-deep choice table. node consolidation combines  by rule  steady-state and dynamic classification at the boundaries into a single phonetic transcription. additional procedures are employed at this point to delete or insert boundaries based on time-domain information. anchor-point procedures place symbols immediately following the segmentation indicators  marking the certainty with which the boundary is placed and/or the preliminary name is assigned. a bar  !  indicates a definite segmentation point and a plus  +  indicates a definite boundary name. 
　　　the output of the classification stage  which serves as input to the linguistic decoding stage  is basically a string of machine-derived phonetic symbols. using standard phonetic notation  international 
1 
phonetics association  an essentially broad* transcription of the example utterance was aurally determined to be 

using our machine-related  alphaphonetic  two-character-per-node method of 
transcription 	the 	corresponding 
representation would be 

the alphaphonetic s t r i n g actually obtained from the acoustic c l a s s i f i e r for a particular utterance can be considered a noisy version of some acceptable phonetic t r a n s c r i p t i o n . 
linguistic decoder 
       the function of l i n g u i s t i c decoding is that of phoneme-to-grapheme t r a n s l a t i o n   that i s   the conversion of t h i s noisy phonetic sequence from a phonetic representation of speaker performance into a 
 standard-orthographical representation of speaker i n t e n t i o n . linguistic decoding u t i l i z e s a speech-oriented  graph-search technique based on the fano algorithm  1   sentence production is modeled by a 1-word command language** capable of producing approximately 1 m i l l i o n d i f f e r e n t sentences. the average length of a sentence is eight words. for each word entry the lexicon contains a description of phonetic paths corresponding essentially to the reasonable pronunciations of the word. these pronunciation variations were generated automatically by a set of phonological rules operating on   i d e a l   or  standard  pronunciations  1 . since the lexicon describes approximately 1 speaker-dependent phonetic paths per word  the tree to be searched contains about ten-to-the-sixteenth-power phonetic paths per sentence  not including paths to account for machine error. the decoder output consists of time-aligned  hypothesized phonetic-symbol and word strings with indications of the types of hypotheses which are necessary to arrive at these strings from the input data. 
* except f o r stop a s p i r a t i o n we have used broad phonetic t r a n s c r i p t i o n i n t h i s work. broad phonetic t r a n s c r i p t i o n roughly approximates phonemic t r a n s c r i p t i o n . on occasion  however  we have experimented w i t h c e r t a i n a l l o p h o n i c v a r i a t i o n s   such as l i g h t versus dark   i  . the r e s t r i c t i o n to e s s e n t i a l l y broad t r a n s c r i p t i o n has been due l a r g e l y to computer c o n s i d e r a t i o n s i n v o l v i n g acoustic c l a s s i f i c a t i o n . 
** the command language is s p e c i f i e d by a simple c o n t e x t - f r e e grammar  1 . the c r i t e r i a by which our choice of a command language was made are perhaps worth mentioning. the primary c r i t e r i a were t h a t i  the grammar must be e a s i l y implementable b y machine  i i   the s t a t i s t i c a l p r o p e r t i e s must be such t h a t phonetic decoding could be c o n t r o l l e d and s t u d i e d independently of syntax and semantics  and i i i   it should be of such a complexity t h a t system performance is n e i t h e r too good nor too poor  so t h a t system improvements can be e a s i l y seen. 
for the example u t t e r a n c e t h i s o u t p u t is shown in f i g . 1. these hypotheses are concerned w i t h two types of n o i s e : t h a t considered to o r i g i n a t e from the speaker 
 dependent  d  and t h a t from the system  independent  i   . w i t h i n each t y p e   the noise is f u r t h e r categorized as s u b s t i t u t i o n  s   omission  1  or i n s e r t i o n  i  of phonetic events r e l a t i v e to the hypothesized s t r i n g . thus  in the example u t t e r a n c e   the   i s   at the f o u r t h node represents the hypothesis t h a t the i n p u t node was a speaker-independent  machine-related  s u b s t i t u t i o n of one sound   p  f o r another   t     anchors are u t i l i z e d t o r e s t r i c t the types of hypotheses allowed at the node l e v e l . thus  i does not permit i n s e r t i o n hypotheses and + does not permit s u b s t i t u t i o n o r i n s e r t i o n hypotheses  r e l a t i v e t o the hypothesized s t r i n g . 
adaptive 	c o n t r o l l e r 
       the aim of the c o n t r o l mechanism is to v e r i f y or r e j e c t the hypotheses made in a r r i v i n g at the l i n g u i s t i c - d e c o d e r output so as to improve subsequent processing. feedback is made at the sentence l e v e l ; the control-mechanism procedures may modify the phonetic and/or anchor i n f o r m a t i o n w h i c h   in t u r n   may lead to changes in subsequent decoder o u t p u t . the procedures make use of i n f o r m a t i o n a v a i l a b l e at the a c o u s t i c - c l a s s i f i e r l e v e l . s p e c i f i c a l l y   s e q u e n t i a l s p e c t r a l - c o r r e l a t i o n   ranked dynamic-segment c l a s s i f i c a t i o n and a general   w o r d - f i t   c r i t e r i o n are employed. the w o r d - f i t c r i t e r i o n concerns the degree t o which an hypothesized word r e q u i r e s h y p o t h e t i c a l change from the noisy i n p u t s t r i n g . 
       the r e s u l t s of adaptive c o n t r o l on the example u t t e r a n c e are presented in f i g . 1. the only p o r t i o n of the example u t t e r a n c e changed by feedback was the p r e p o s i t i o n a l phrase. for the f i r s t and second passes the hypothesized word output f o r t h a t p o r t i o n was   . . . b e t w e e n those camps.  on the t h i r d and f o u r t h passes the o u t p u t became   . . . o v e r the cover  and then   . . . on the c o v e r     r e s p e c t i v e l y   never reaching the intended   . . . u n d e r the c o v e r .   i t might b e noted t h a t of these f o u r passes the alignment of i n p u t and hypothesized nodes is considered most accurate   r e l a t i v e to speaker performance  f o r pass t h r e e   due to the proper alignment of   t h e .   
       on the three types of hypotheses which may be made at a p a r t i c u l a r p o i n t in the s t r i n g - s u b s t i t u t i o n   omission or i n s e r t i o n - the a c t i o n taken by the c o n t r o l mechanism may be p o s i t i v e   negative or n e u t r a l . for s u b s t i t u t i o n hypotheses the p o s i t i v e or negative a c t i o n i s t o change t o   o r p r o h i b i t change t o   the hypothesized name. for omission hypotheses  the p o s i t i v e or negative a c t i o n i s t o i n s e r t   o r p r o h i b i t i n s e r t i o n of  the hypothesized name. for i n s e r t i o n hypotheses  the p o s i t i v e or negative a c t i o n i s t o d e l e t e   o r p r o h i b i t d e l e t i o n o f   the name originally inputted to the linguistic decoder. for a l l three hypothesis types  neutral action leaves the o r i g i n a l input unaltered. the procedure is as follows. 
       f i r s t   the w o r d - f i t c r i t e r i o n i s applied in terms of i n f o r m a t i o n at the word l e v e l w i t h i n the adaptive c o n t r o l l e r . an hypothesized word i s considered i n  poor f i t   if i  every node in the word required h y p o t h e t i c a l change  i i   a gross class s u b s t i t u t i o n was hypothesized   e . g .   a vowel hypothesized as a stop  and/or i i i   the r a t i o of independent omission and i n s e r t i o n hypotheses to hypothesized-word l e n g t h exceeded a t h r e s h o l d . the w o r d - f i t c r i t e r i o n is used e i t h e r to a l l o w or d i s a l l o w the use of the hypothesized word and corresponding components to d i r e c t the attempt to v e r i f y an

       second  s u b s t i t u t i o n hypotheses are t e s t e d using as c o n f i r m i n g or r e j e c t i n g c r i t e r i a the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n i n f o r m a t i o n a t the node  boundary c o r r e l a t i o n and transeme names  l e v e l . confirmation takes place by changing an i n p u t node to the hypothesized node when there is s u f f i c i e n t i n f o r m a t i o n to support the h y p o t h e s i s . rejection takes the form of i  plus  +  anchor placement if the o r i g i n a l name is detected to a high degree in the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n i n f o r m a t i o n o r i i   i f n o evidence of the hypothesized name is found  t h a t name is suppressed in subsequent l i n g u i s t i c decoding. since a l l actions are c u m u l a t i v e   more than one name could be p r o h i b i t e d as a s u b s t i t u t i o n f o r a node a f t e r several passes. for the example u t t e r a n c e   a l l r e j e c t i o n s were of the suppression v a r i e t y . 
       t h i r d   omission hypotheses are t e s t e d using as c o n f i r m a t i o n or r e j e c t i o n c r i t e r i a the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n i n f o r m a t i o n at the i n t e r - n o d e l e v e l - t h a t i s   c o r r e l a t i o n s between boundaries.* for example  a v o w e l   i   was hypothesized as having been omitted between the e l e v e n t h   f   a n d the t w e l f t h  s  nodes of the o r i g i n a l s t r i n g . this was an hypothesis of dependent omission   d o   . since the   w o r d - f i t   c r i t e r i o n was met  the adaptive c o n t r o l l e r accessed the i n f o r m a t i o n between these boundaries  looking f o r a sequence of f i v e successive i x   i   names in the c o r r e l a t i o n s w i t h i n t h r e e percent o f f i r s t - c h o i c e c o r r e l a t i o n   f i g . 1   . this would have been s u f f i c i e n t to confirm the h y p o t h e s i s   i n s e r t i n g i n t o the s t r i n g f o r subsequent l i n g u i s t i c decoding. however  since such a search d i d not produce s u f f i c i e n t evidence of the hypothesized sound  no a c t i o n was taken. for an independent omission  1   if there is no evidence of the hypothesized sound found in the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n d a t a   a dot anchor {.  is placed a f t e r the i n d i c a t o r immediately f o l l o w i n g the hypothesized omission  d i s a l l o w i n g omission hypotheses a t t h i s p o i n t i n the s t r i n g d u r i n g subsequent l i n g u i s t i c decoding.

	present 	system. 
1. in order to make another feedback loop  there must be at l e a s t one hypothesis r e j e c t i o n   i . e .   one or more node suppressions or dot  bar or plus anchors. this was considered reasonable in t h a t supportive a c t i o n should not cause a change in word o u t p u t . 
1. for computational purposes a s p e c i f i e d number of feedback loops cannot be exceeded. a maximum of three was employed h e r e . 
       since it was found t h a t simply t a k i n g the l a s t o u t p u t s t r i n g was not o p t i m a l   a d d i t i o n a l s e l e c t i o n c r i t e r i a were e s t a b l i s h e d to s e l e c t the best output from among the candidates  i . e .   the o r i g i n a l and feedback passes. it was e m p i r i c a l l y established on t r a i n i n g data t h a t it would be reasonable to take the l a s t complete sentence o u t p u t   if any complete sentence occurred  and to simply take the l a s t output where only incomplete sentences were o b t a i n e d . thus the only outputs selected which were not the most r e c e n t l y obtained 
1 
were those in which a complete sentence became incomplete through feedback. 
results 
　　　evaluation was performed on a t o t a l of 1 sentence-length utterances  1 test utterances from one speaker under the intra-speaker condition  and 1 test utterances from each of three speakers under the inter-speaker condition. thus  one of the training speakers was also used for evaluation on test sentences. these performance results are shown in table 1. 
　　　performance was evaluated in percentages at the following levels  before and after feedback. 
　　　1. sentences correctly decoded relative to a l l sentences entered. this provides a measure of overall sentence performance with no other factors considered.* 
　　　1. sentences correctly decoded relative to those sentences outputted in complete form. if sentences outputted in incomplete form are considered to be system rejects  and therefore subject to reentry  then this percentage provides a measure of system performance relative to system acceptance. if this percentage were sufficiently high and substantially higher than the f i r s t measure  the rejection condition would become operationally useful. 
　　　it might be mentioned that it is probably possible to achieve the above by making it more d i f f i c u l t for the system to output complete sentences by tightening system constraints. this would undoubtedly occur only at the expense of an increase in rejection rate  ceteris paribus. 
　　　1. sentences rejected. 
　　　1. correct words in non-rejected sentences. this provides additional analysis at the subsentence level where f u l l sentences are outputted. if enough were known on an operational basis about the relative importance of words according to some linguistic/semantic referent  such an analysis would become increasingly meaningful with regard to information transfer. with this in mind  it is probable that  as such linguistic/semantic referents are brought within operational knowledge  this measure w i l l become increasingly important. 
　　　1. words 	correct 	relative 	to 	words 
* in addition  percentage of sentences with only one word in error relative to a l l sentences is of interest  since there can exist words which are minimally different phonetically  but equally l i k e l y at some point in the s t r i n g . this is one condition under which a very minor error in acoustic analysis can create  without more sophisticated language constraints  an incorrect sentence. the percentage of time that this happens  therefore  can aid in analysis of l i n g u i s t i c processing at the node and word levels. 
outputted  whether or not in complete sentences. this corresponds  at the word level  to number 1 above. 
　　　1. words rejected. 
　　　1. words correct relative to a l l words entered. this corresponds to 1 above. 
　　　1. words 	correct 	relative 	to 	words outputted 	from 	those 	utterances 	in 	which feedback 	changed 	the 	word 	output. 	this provides 	a 	specific 	measure 	of 	feedback performance. 
　　　the speaker involved in both training and test-sentence evaluation w i l l hereafter be referred to as  speaker 1   . as might be expected  accuracy within the linguistic processor was somewhat higher for this speaker than that for the other test speakers. 
discussion 
philosophy of analysis 
　　　if the goal of processing is automatic speech understanding  the performance evaluation must be tied to the appropriateness of consequent  actions  taken as a result of semantic factors. however  for the present system  whose goal is automatic conversion of speech signals to printed sentences in standard orthographical form  questions arise in the analysis of performance data concerning the referent to be employed. for l i n g u i s t i c processor output the parameters of concern are accuracy at the word and sentence levels. two types of errors are considered for each level errors of omission and errors of commission. the f i r s t are typically manifested in terms of word or sentence rejection by the linguistic processor and the second by words outputted in error. this corresponds with human speech-perception behavior insofar as the listener asks the speaker to repeat himself  rejection  or misinterprets what the speaker said  substitution  deletion and/or insertion of words . 
　　　if one cares to carry the analogy further it may be reasonably hypothesized that human listeners err in their speech perception behavior  assuming optimal signal conditions  in terms of two major phenomena - those errors of omission which result when the input w i l l not map through the listener's  model  and those errors of commission which result when a wrong path is taken through the model. from a diagnostic point of view  it can be seen that both errors of omission and commission arise from the same two sources - receiver model limitations and input corruption. further diagnosis of the human situation becomes exceedingly d i f f i c u l t and  in fact  v i r t u a l l y impossible  due to the subtleties of the communication event  listener  set  and point of view of the diagnostician. for example  while some small nuance in the expression of a speaker may be completely misinterpreted by the listener  it is moot whether the miscommunication is due to speaker misevaluation of listener sophistication or to the limited 
s o p h i s t i c a t i o n of the l i s t e n e r . it must be noted t h a t  miscommunication  i n v o l v i n g human processing n e c e s s a r i l y involves l e v e l s of processing which are much deeper than those o p e r a t i o n a l l y involved i n automatic processing by machine at the present t i m e . with the exception of some t r i v i a l cases  in which l e x i c a l items may be viewed independently a s o p e r a t i o n a l v a r i a b l e s   i . e .   simple o p p o s i t i o n s such as yes/no and the l i k e   there are p r e s e n t l y i n s u f f i c i e n t o p e r a t i o n a l data extant concerning these deeper l e v e l s of n a t u r a l language as they may be manifested phenomenologically. 
       with the above in mind  it appears to be reasonable to set as the e v a l u a t i o n r e f e r e n t f o r system  performance v a r i a t i o n s at both the phonetic and l e x i c a l l e v e l s which are not in v i o l a t i o n of the model being u t i l i z e d as our   l i s t e n e r     i . e .   the arcs system  not i n c l u d i n g s t a t i s t i c a l phenomena considered to 
be 	speaker-independent. 
       at the node l e v e l   if an event in the output s t r i n g cannot be reasonably accounted f o r   then it is considered to be an e r r o r . in such cases it is possible to determine the source of the e r r o r   whether it be in segmentation o r c l a s s i f i c a t i o n . 
       a t the word l e v e l   i f a n i n p u t s t r i n g i s accounted f o r and the l i n g u i s t i c - p r o c e s s o r output is i n c o r r e c t r e l a t i v e to the known i n p u t   then the word is considered an e r r o r a r i s i n g from the l i n g u i s t i c processor. however  the processor has been designed so as to overcome i n p u t contamination r e s u l t i n g from the speaker and/or acoustic a n a l y s i s . thus  w h i l e components of a word w i l l be considered in e r r o r the word i t s e l f may not be in e r r o r ; word e r r o r s and phonetic e r r o r s may be t r e a t e d independently. 
　　　　the most s t r i n g e n t t e s t of system performance is made at the sentence l e v e l . in order f o r a sentence to be c o r r e c t   i t s d e s c r i p t i o n a t a l l l e v e l s o f processing must remain w i t h i n the c a p a b i l i t y of the system to overcome e r r o r . excessiveness of e r r o r at any l e v e l of processing w i l l be r e f l e c t e d at the sentence l e v e l   since the a p r i o r i p r o b a b i l i t y o f c o r r e c t sentence output i s v i r t u a l l y zero  1 m i l l i o n   . i d e a l l y   the system w i l l r e j e c t s t r i n g s i n which contamination is excessive. this may be viewed as a r e j e c t c o n d i t i o n at the sentence l e v e l   corresponding to the necessity f o r the speaker to repeat the sentence. a sentence may be considered in e r r o r in v a r y i n g degrees  depending on the number of words r e j e c t e d o r o u t p u t t e d i n e r r o r   i n r e a l i t y   a simple counting of c o r r e c t words in. r e l a t i o n s h i p to t o t a l word content of a sentence does not r e f l e c t the t r u e degree of e r r o r i n v o l v e d i n terms o f i n f o r m a t i o n . i t is c l e a r t h a t f o r purposes of semantics the kind of word o u t p u t t e d in e r r o r should be of primary i n t e r e s t ; in f a c t   a one-word e r r o r can be more severe than m u l t i p l e - w o r d e r r o r s depending on the semantic weights of the words i n v o l v e d . since there are no semantic f a c t o r s i n c o r p o r a t e d / as such  in the present system  i t i s not meaningful t o evaluate performance along t h i s dimension. 
diagnosis of system error 
       a d d i t i o n a l analysis of the performance data beyond pure e x p o s i t i o n is extremely d i f f i c u l t a t the present t i m e . i t should b e clear t h a t in the development of a system as complex as t h i s   the o p t i m i z a t i o n and s t a b i l i z a t i o n of performance w i l l progress as a f u n c t i o n of depth i n t o the system  i . e .   as a f u n c t i o n of cumulative complexity. however  these r e s u l t s are c e r t a i n l y encouraging f o r the present approach. 
       in analyzing e r r o r in the output of the l i n g u i s t i c decoder  it became apparent t h a t a considerable amount of the e r r o r term was a t t r i b u t a b l e to i n t e r a c t i o n between the two major stages of processing. an a d d i t i o n a l e r r o r component was explainable in terms of inadequacies at one or the other stage. 
       for acoustic analysis the primary problems arose from i n t r u s i v e phenomena which exceed the present c l a s s i f i c a t i o n nomenclature. some examples of such are g l o t t a l a r r e s t s at word boundaries  the s1 at sts 1 and the m at sts 1 i n f i g . 1  - normally c l a s s i f i e d as stops by the system; aspirated releases o f i n i t i a l vowels normally c l a s s i f i e d as f r i c a t i v e s or stop a s p i r a t i o n ; voice breaks and fundamental-frequency and/or i n t e g r a t i o n - i n t e r v a l i n t e r a c t i o n - normally c l a s s i f i e d as r a p i d closures   s h o r t   shallow dips in the s h o r t - t i m e amplitude measure ; and p a r t i a l d i s s i m i l a t i o n of v o c a l i c s when they occur between f r i c a t i v e s - p o t e n t i a l l y c l a s s i f i a b l e as one f r i c a t i v e f o r f r i c a t i v e - v o c a l i c - f r i c a t i v e . a number of 
methods f o r overcoming these e r r o r s have been i n v e s t i g a t e d . some of the techniques were incorporated i n t o segmentation  others i n t o dual c l a s s i f i c a t i o n   and s t i l l others i n t o l i n g u i s t i c processing  p r i m a r i l y i n terms o f l e x i c a l r e p r e s e n t a t i o n . in the example u t t e r a n c e   the two f r i c a t i v e s i n   o f f i c e r   were obtained v i a one of these c o r r e c t i v e methods a t the segmentation l e v e l . i t i s c l e a r   however  t h a t in many cases there is a need for expanding the nomenclature used in c l a s s i f i c a t i o n so as to allow the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of some of these events uniquely. consequently  the decoding at l a t e r stages must be able to hypothesize c o r r e c t l y concerning such events  w i t h o u t p e n a l i z i n g as h e a v i l y as w i t h   t r u e   e r r o r s in the i n p u t . an example of t h i s would be the unique c l a s s i f i c a t i o n of g l o t t a l a r r e s t s and r e l e a s e s . 
       some other problems arose from f a l s e - p o s i t i v e c o n d i t i o n s i n the time-domain processing during dual c l a s s i f i c a t i o n . the primary offender was f a l s e d e l e t i o n of nodes needed in order to traverse the c o r r e c t path in l i n g u i s t i c decoding. in the example utterance d in  under  and the vowel of the second   t h e   were d e l e t e d . these d e l e t i o n s were the major problem p r e v e n t i n g c o r r e c t decoding of t h i s u t t e r a n c e . the opposite c o n d i t i o n - f a l s e i n s e r t i o n - r a r e l y occurred. it was noted t h a t c e r t a i n kinds of e r r o r s tended t o occur i n p a i r s   p r i m a r i l y i n the case of a d v e n t i t i o u s r a p i d - c l o s u r e i d e n t i f i c a t i o n . under t h i s c o n d i t i o n a s i n g l e continuant becomes three events - t h e 
1 
f i r s t part of the continuant  the rapid closure  and the f i n a l part of the continuant. while methods have been implemented to correct such errors  they continue to represent a point of d i f f i c u l t y for the entire system. 
　　　within l i n g u i s t i c processing the primary decoding problem takes the form of a mismatch between word ranking and phonetic decoding. as the system is presently employed it is possible to rank a word by u t i l i z i n g a particular word template in which specific errors of omission/insertion are hypothesized and then proceed with decoding at the phonetic level with no knowledge of the template assumptions made. in practice  opposing hypotheses can occur in phonetic decoding relative to word ranking  resulting many times in a wrong path. this problem contributes heavily to two forms of undesirable performance - a high reject rate and low accuracy at the sentence level. 
　　　another problem concerns edge effects. backtracking is never i n i t i a t e d for the last hypothesized node of the f i n a l word of an hypothesized sentence  and a single remaining input node can be l e f t unaccounted for without decreasing the similarity measure {fig. 1 . these techniques were employed to encourage sentence completion within a reasonable processing time and are considered temporary measures during the development of the system. another technique used to encourage sentence completion was the rather l i b e r a l setting of threshold spacing; for the example utterance  a tighter threshold spacing of 1 directly yeilded output corresponding to passes 1 and 1. 
　　　the present method used for lexical representation also has some shortcomings which r e f l e c t themselves in system error. lexical representation is insufficiently flexible to account for multiple  ideal  transcriptions. it is obvious that for any word there exists more than one transcription which may be considered   i d e a l     depending on context. since use is not made of long-term phonetic context  it is not reasonable to allow a l l  dependent  variations of a word with equal probability  as this would essentially negate the advantages obtained in the present probabilistic processing. for example  provision cannot be made for both 
  i n t r i s t s   	and 	  i n t r i s   	for 	the 	word 
 interests . in fact  the concept of  ideal  is questionable for these purposes. it may be more appropriate to substitute a phonologically-based  expected string for the present  ideal  representation. conversely  the present lexical representation is sufficiently constrained relative to the method of accounting for dependent omissions in that multiple sequentially occurring omissions are permitted in error. 
fortunately  the penalty placed on dependent omissions is sufficient to avoid this problem in the vast majority of cases. 
　　　another problem concerns some limitations of the syntactic model. most obvious is the way in which the definite a r t i c l e  the  is handled. while this word is treated as a required word in certain paths. in practice it has been found that it is not uncommon for speakers simply to omit the word phonetically and instead rely on prosodic features. some form of prosodic analysis 
w i l l be required. 
　　　another component which w i l l undoubtedly be required is some 	mechanism to account for fusion phenomena at 	word boundaries such 	as the phonetic change from didju to d idzu   in the word pair  did you . 
specific versus general feedback action 
　　　there are two types of verification/rejection handled by the adaptive controller - specific and general: those which are specific concern particular node names  e.g.  suppression prohibits the hypothesis of a particular name at a particular point in the string ; those which are general concern more than a single node name  e.g.  a bar anchor prohibits the hypothesis of insertion for any  node name at that point in the s t r i n g   . optimally  a system would contain specific and general actions for each hypothesis type. because the present system provides no specific action types for certain situations  e.g.  where a dot anchor prohibits any omission hypothesis in subsequent processing   it is not d i f f i c u l t to imagine a situation in which a general suppression of the omission hypothesis  based on the i n a b i l i t y to find a specific name in the data  would lead to d i f f i c u l t y when another event had indeed been missed. at the present status of system development essentially only the general mechanisms have been provided. 
　　　it might be noted that the application of specific actions can be considered looser than those which prohibit a whole class of hypotheses. the empirical data demonstrated the need for specific actions regarding hypothesized insertions and omissions in that the main action which led to increased decoding accuracy was the specific action of suppression  accounting for approximately 1 percent of the actions taken. 
comparison with manual speech recognition 
　　　the primary source of data presently available which may be used for purposes of comparison is that of klatt and stevens  1  * in which manual speech recognition was attempted by visual examination of 
' vicens  1  described an automatic system in which multiple-word input was limited by u t i l i z i n g a 1-word vocabulary and a highly-constrained syntax  capable of generating 1 sentences. in this highly constrained situation  accuracy at the word level was 1 percent when new speakers were used. the system contained no provision for adaptive control of the type under consideration here. since this system u t i l i z e d a highly constrained vocabulary and syntax in order to avoid a l l but the coarsest phonetic distinctions  it would have to be modified significantly in order to achieve useful word recognition accuracy with vocabularies of the size being employed here. 
spectrograms. on 1 sentences {1 words  produced by five speakers using entries from a 1-word lexicon with a syntax describing  ...questions asked of a computer program whose data base concerned the chemical analysis of moon rocks  1    they reported overall word-recognition performance of 1 percent correct for each of two experimenters. they also employed a form of verification/rejection akin to that described here. 
       it is of interest to compare the present performance data at earlier stages of processing with those reported by klatt and stevens. in the latter work  1 phonetic segments were transcribed. at the segmentation level  1 percent were missed and no mention was made of adventitious segments. at the classification level  1 percent were incorrectly transcribed and 1o percent were transcribed only partially  in accordance with a phonetic-feature inventory . thus 1 percent of the segments were completely correct and 1 percent were either partially or completely correct. in the present work  1 segments were transcribed from two speakers who were new to the system. at the segmentation level  1 percent were missed and 1 percent were adventitious. at the classification level  b1 percent of the segments were completely correct  not including those missed and 1 percent were correct at the phonetic class level  the nearest analog to the phonetic-feature measure . although these measures are not exactly comparable  the automatic acoustic analysis of the present work appears to compare favorably with the reported manual acoustic analysis. 
therefore  the difference between word accuracy of these two studies appears to be explainable in terms of the difference between processing by the human system at the word level using a l l the constraints available to that system and automatic processing with limited syntactic and no semantic constraints. 
       klatt and stevens'  subjective  evaluation of their performance was that it is not encouraging for workers in the field of automatic speech recognition because of the  ...seeming complexity of the things we were doing in our heads in order to recognize a feature or word or phrase  1 . the present writers are encouraged  however  by the performance data being reported here  since they were obtained using completely automatic procedures at a l l levels of processing  and since these data are based on the utterances of several -untrained speakers using a larger vocabulary. in addition  it is f e l t that adaptive control procedures  such as those herein described  w i l l be significantly helpful in achieving eventual convergence of input and output in arcs. these results should also be encouraging for other workers who are interested in pragmatic solutions for arcs problems. 
       certainly much remains to be done in this area and the present work can only be veiwed as an i n i t i a l probe. feedback of whole sentence-length strings may  in fact  not be the optimal and only level at which feedback should be performed. for example  it is likely that a combination of looping at the word level during i n i t i a l decoding would be more appropriate when both accuracy and processing time are considered. in such differential looping the confirmation or rejection of hypotheses would probably depend on different levels of analysis  most likely phonetic at the word level and semantic or prosodic at the sentence level.
