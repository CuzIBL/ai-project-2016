- estimation of stationary and non-stationary image components; 
- regions and their boundaries for stationary and non-stationary image components  obtained by segmenting them according to greyvalue character i s t i c s ; 
- candidates for projection of object surfaces  combining different regions representing the projection of one object candidate into the image plane; 
- object and compound object candidates in a 1-d description; 
- abstractions based on relations between objects. 
results for a simple situation - object translation parallel to the image plane  with image size  form and orientation remaining constant - have been reported by nagel 1. a minimum spanning tree clustering approach has been developed dreschler 1  nagel 1  for feature descriptors of nonstationary image components. it allows to connect object projections despite drastic overall changes of size  form or orientation - provided such changes build up in small steps from frame to frame. this approach has been applied successfully to three tv-frame sequences of street scenes with 1 to 1 frames each  covering  e.g.  a car taking a left turn into a side street and coping with overa l l size changes in excess of 1 within 1 frames. 
the availability of extended frame sequences is exploited by gradually building up a reliable de-
scription based on evidence from many frames without undue emphasis on the f i r s t frame. rather the i n i t i a l frames of a sequence are evaluated to form a plan indicating which subsection of the following frames should be investigated in more detail: the plan formation concept of kelly 1 is extended into the time dimension! a more detailed discussion of this system may be found in nagel 1  including comparisons with other approaches like the one of chow and aggarwal 1.
