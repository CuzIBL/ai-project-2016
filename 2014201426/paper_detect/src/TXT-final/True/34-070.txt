hypothesis evaluation la performed with a procedure whoae block 
diagram is shown in fig. 1   
             when a syllable or a coarliculalion segment la hypothesized on a certain portion of ihe spectrogram  tha sfsa of that segment and the correspo-
nding description translator are built up from the grammar of speech. 
　　　　　　　this operation is simple and fasi due to the straightforward ratalloni between the productions and ihe automata. the syllable description is processed by the description translator  ot . the dt translates a primitive form  with its attributes to describe correctly some torment evolutions  into a symbol and its associated probability. the symbol is emitted only if some conditions on the attributes are verified. these conditions are stored for a talker mna a typical lexical position of the segment and can be modified by soma epea war depeitdent modifiers  acting mainly on the form ant loci for the etable-xones constraints. in addition  some iextcal- dependent modifiers  acting mainly on ihe durations   change ihe constraints in accordance with the stress of the salient. the design of such modifiers that also involves the knowledge of 
probability di ir ibutions is actually limited to spactral loci end ttia influence of
