1 introduction
in this paper  we propose a modal logic for reasoning about possibilistic belief fusion. this is a combination of multiagent epistemic logic and possibilistic logic. we use graded epistemic operators to represent agents' uncertain beliefs  and the operators are interpreted in accordance with possibilistic semantics. we employ ordered fusion based on a level skipping strategy to resolve the inconsistency caused by direct fusion; that is  the level at which the inconsistency occurs is skipped. here  we present the formal semantics and an axiomatic system for the logic.
1 syntax
to encode the degrees of reliability of n agents  we use ordering relations over any subset of {1 ... n}. let t on denote the set of all possible strict total orders over any nonempty subset of {1 ... n}. then  we can associate a unique syntactic notation with each strict total order in t on. let x = {i1 i1 ... im} be a non-empty subset of {1 ... n} and   be a strict total order such that ij   ik iff j   k for all 1 ¡Ü j k ¡Ü m. then  the syntactic notation for  x    is the string i1   i1   ¡¤¡¤¡¤   im.
¡¡in this paper  the capital letter o is used to denote metavariables ranging over such notations. let o be the string i1   i1   ¡¤¡¤¡¤   im  then the set {i1 i1 ... im} is called the domain of o  denoted by ¦Ä o . in this case  o   im+1 denotes i1   i1   ¡¤¡¤¡¤   im   im+1 if im+1¡Ê ¦Ä o . as the syntactic notation is unique for each total order  we can also identify the notation with the total order itself  and write o ¡Ê t on. furthermore  the upper-case greek letter   is used to denote meta-variables ranging over nonempty subsets of t on.
¡¡we now present the syntax of our logic for reasoning about possibilistic belief fusion based on a level skipping strategy.
the logic is called sfpl  where is the inconsistency tolerance degree of the logic and   is a continuous t-norm1. let ¦µ1 be a set of propositional symbols. then the set of well-formed formulas  wff  of sfpl is defined as the smallest set containing ¦µ1 ¡È {¡Í  }  and is closed under boolean operators and the following rule:
  if   is a wff  then    a  and    +a   are wffs for any nonempty     t on  and any rational number a ¡Ê

if   = {o} is a singleton  we write  o a   resp.    instead of  {o} a   resp.  {o} a+   . intuitively   o a   resp.
  means that an agent merging distributed beliefs in accordance with the ordering of o will believe   with a strength at least equal to  resp. more than  a. we can view each o as a virtual agent  and     corresponds to a distributed belief operator  fagin et al.  1  of virtual agents in  . note that our purpose is to ensure the consistency of ordered fusion based on any single order o. when   contains more than one order   may hold. this does not matter  however  since a non-singleton   plays only an auxiliary role in our logic.
1 semantics
to present the semantics  we briefly review possibility theory  zadeh  1 . in this theory  each possibility distribution ¦Ð : w ¡ú  1  can derive an associated possibility measure ¦° : 1w ¡ú  1  and a necessity measure n : 1w ¡ú  1   as ¦° x  = supx¡Êx ¦Ð x  and n x  = 1   supx¡Ê1 x ¦Ð x . a possibility distribution ¦Ð : w ¡ú  1  is normalized if ¦° w  = 1. a normalized possibility distribution represents a consistent belief state. if ¦Ð is not normalized  i.e.  supx¡Êw ¦Ð x    1  it represents a partially inconsistent belief state. 1   supx¡Êw ¦Ð x  is called the inconsistency degree of ¦Ð  and is denoted by ¦É ¦Ð .
¡¡an sfpl-structure is a tuple m =  w  ¦Ði 1¡Üi¡Ün v    where w is a set of possible worlds  each ¦Ði maps each world w to a possibility distribution ¦Ði w : w ¡ú  1  over w such thatmaps elements in ¦µ1 to subsets of w. we define ¦Ðo w for each o ¡Ê t on and w ¡Ê w inductively as follows:
if
	o i w =	¦Ðo w   ¦Ði w	otherwise.
furthermore  we also define ¦Ð  w for each     t on and w ¡Ê w  as ¦Ð  w = no¡Ê  ¦Ðo w. then  the satisfaction relation |= for sfpl-model is defined as
  w |= p iff w ¡Ê v  p   for each p ¡Ê ¦µ1 
  w |1= ¡Í and w |=   
  w |=    iff w 1|=   
  w |=   ¡Å ¦× iff w |=   or w |= ¦× 
  w |=    a  iff n  w | |  ¡Ý a 
  w |=    +a   iff n  w | |    a 
where | | is the truth set of   in the model and n  w is the necessity measure associated with ¦Ð  w.
¡¡a set of wffs ¦² is satisfied in a world w  written as w |= ¦²  if w |=   for all   ¡Ê ¦². we write ¦² |=m   if  for each possible world w in m  w |= ¦² implies w |=  ; and
¦² |=sfplfor each sfpl-structure m. ¦² can be omitted when it is an empty set  so a wff   is valid in
m  denoted by |=m    if   |=m    and |=sfpln	denotes

1 proof theory
an axiomatic system can be developed for sfplby generalizing the corresponding axioms of dbfsn  liau  1  and pl n  boldrin and saffiotti  1 . the axiomatic system for sfpl is presented in figure 1. the symbol ¨’ in axiom v1 denotes the t-conorm corresponding to    which is defined as a ¨’ b = 1    1   a     1   b . the axiom v1 is the requirement that the inconsistency degree of each agent's belief state is not more than   which is the inconsistency tolerance degree of the logic. the axioms o1 and o1 further enforce the same property for each virtual agent o.
¡¡a wff   is derivable from the system sfpl  or simply    is a theorem of sfpl  if there is a finite sequence  1 ...  m such that   =  m and every  i is an instance of an axiom schema; or it is obtained from earlier  j's by the application of an inference rule. it is written asif   is a theorem of sfpl. let ¦² ¡È { } be a subset of wffs  then   is derivable from ¦² in the system sfpl   written as   if there is a finite subset ¦²1 of ¦² such that

1 concluding remarks
in this paper  we present a modal logic for reasoning about ordered fusion of possibilistic beliefs based on a level skipping strategy. while direct fusion and ordered fusion in epistemic logic  fagin et al.  1; cholvy  1; liau  1   as well as direct fusion in possibilistic logic  boldrin and saffiotti  1  have been proposed previously in the literature  the results in this paper fill a gap in the previous works. the modal logic should be applicable to reasoning in multi-agent systems. in future work  it should be possible to consider operations other than t-norms for the fusion of possibility distributions.
