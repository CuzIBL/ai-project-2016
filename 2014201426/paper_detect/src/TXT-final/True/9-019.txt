　　　paper introduced a concept of a variable-valued l o g i c  vl  system and defined a p a r t i c u l a r vl system called vl1 . one of the basic assumptions underlying 
the concept of a vl system is that every proposition   c a l l e d a vl formula  and a l l the variables in the proposition  used to represent any o b j e c t s   e . g .   other propositions  are allowed to accept t h e i r own 
number of truth-values which are problem- and semantics-dependent. from the viewpoint of formal l o g i c   the concept of a vl system is an extension of the concept of a many-valued logic system. 
　　　one of the applications of the vl. system is that it can be used as an inductive system which when supplied with 'numerical names' of o b j e c t s   t h e i r a t t r i b u t e s   r e l a t i o n s between the objects or t h e i r p a r t s   e t c .   can i n f e r a description of objects or object classes  which is simplest in a w e l l - d e f i n e d sense  and also which is a generalization of the input information. 
 at to the power union  ve w i l l assume that 
		 1  
　　　thus  for each object o  there exists at least one object class containing i t . index j of class k. is called the numerical name of kj. the set j indexing classes at.; j 
1 
		 1  
is called the family of numerical class names. 
　　　in general  the index j can assume not only numerical values  but non-numerical names given to classes kj  and then j is called the family of class names. 
　　　as an example  consider the universe of objects  1  to be a group of people. the universe of representations   r  can be   e . g .   a set of pictures or voice records of these people; a set of their fingerprints; numerical data describing their height  sex  hair color  medical test results  and so on; a set of statements characterizing each individual  and  also  a set-
theoretical sum of any two or more of the previous sets. the family of class names  j  can be  e.g.  the set of the names of people in the group or a set of l i s t s with names of those who are short with blue eyes  fat or bald  have m.sc. or ph.d. degrees  etc.  in the second example  sets of class names may not be disjoint. though the usual tendency is to classify objects into disjoint classes  the case of not-disjoint classes is also  in general  of interest.  

　　　important features of vl1 are that the formulas of the system have very simple i n t e r p r e t a t i o n and can 
be very easily handled and evaluated by a general purpose computer  and  as w e l l   by a human   especially using p a r a l l e l or p a n t l l e l - s e q u e n t i a l techniques. 
let: 
t denote a relation between  called the reference relation:*

c h   - 1  c h  = 1  c h1  = 1 and the cardinality of h  c h  = 1  the formula is interpreted as an expression of a function; 
	f: 	e 1 1 1  + 	{1 1 1 	 1  
     note that if t =  1 ... 1   then  denotes the lexicographic order in the usual sense. in this case  a w i l l be specified just as a =  a-list . the t-list allows a designer to 'soften' the rigid attribute priorities assuned in the a-list. 

     in order to use vl1 formulas as classification rules  the representations of objects should be in the form of vectors whose components are discrete varia-
bles. thus  if some variables used to characterize objects are continuous  their ranges of variabilities should be resolved into discrete units. the number of these units should be selected as the minimum which provides sufficient accuracy  to facilitate computations  and can be different for each variable. 
     to specify a functional a one selects a set of attributes  puts them in the desirable priority order in the a-list  and sets values for tolerances in the i - l i s t . thus  the functional is very simple to formu-
late  as well as to evaluate  and also it seems to be well fitted to human intuition in many applications.

 this attribute was designed to capture the 'size' of generalization resulting from the formula as compared to 'true facts'-events specified in the input data.  
vl1 formulas as classification rules  examples  
　　　in this chapter ve i l l u s t r a t e   by two examples  an application of the vl1 system to the synthesis of classification rules. the examples are very simple; their purpose is to provide an insight into the principles  rather than to investigate the boundaries 
of application possibilities. 
example 1 
     suppose there is given a set of eight objects  as shown in figure 1  and it is known  relation t  that 
those denoted  belong to the class with numerical name 1 {briefly  class 1   and those denoted  to class 1. 
     the problem is to find the simplest  in some specified sense  rule  which characterizes objects of class 1 as opposed to objects of class 1. 
　　　 to make the problem clearly understood  suppose that objects were.mixed up. 	the rule  which is to be found  could then be used to restore the original classification with the minimum cost-according to 
some cost functional.   
　　　in order to apply the vl1 system to this problem  a l l objects should be described by sequences of values of certain variables  that is  by events or event sets of some event space e h1  h 1 . . .  hn . then the problem 
becomes that of finding a vl1 expression for a function 
	f: 	e h1 h1 ... hn  -  1  	 1  
such that f e  = 1 for e e ro  r   respectively  where; 
1 - represent classes 1 and 1  respectively 
ro r1 - are event sets representing objects of  respectively. 
     suppose that some specialized procedures have been developed which can identify in the objects such com-
ponents as rectangles  triangles  trapezoids  circles  and ellipses. 
　　　a simple description of every object could then be by specifying how many times each such component appears in every object. let us accept  as a first 
t r i a l   this kind of description as object representations. 
such that f e} = 1 1 for e e r   r   r   respectively   i . e .   for e : r u r1 u r1 the value of f is not restricted . let us determine a classification rule for 1 u 1 based on r into j - {1 1} as a vl1 formula expressing f  b r i e f l y   a vl1 expression for f. a vl1 expression for f minimal under functional: 
	 t z s 	 1  
where t - number of terms  z - number of different variables  s - number of selectors  that i s   an expression which has the minimum number of terms  the minimum number of different variables for that number 


* by set of events which satisfy the  term t is meant the set of a l l events which satisfy every selector in t. of terms  and the minimum number of selectors for that 
number of terms and variables  determined using the gld representation of the function f  is; 

figure 1 shows the sets of cells which correspond to terras of the formula. the formula gives a rule: if an object has one rectangle and one triangle  then it 
* 'gld' stands for generalized logic diagram which is a planar model of a space e h1 ........ hn . 

belongs to undecidable class; if it has 1 or 1 
triangles and 1 e l l i p s e s   or 1 t r i a n g l e and 1 e l l i p s e   then it belongs to class 1; if none of the previous conditions holds  then i t belongs to class1i  bote 
that the formula involves only three variables x1 x1  and x1 out of five  i.e.  requires measuring only the 
number of rectangles  triangles  and ellipses.  the formula has a disadvantage that it cannot classify correctly a l l objects and also seems to be rather complicated. 
　　　let us now try to extend the universe of representations to obtain a disjoint representation of objects. an obvious way to do so seems to also include in the object descriptions information about spacial relationships between object parts. suppose 
that the specialized procedures not only can name the 
object parts  but also can determine binary relations such as 'on the left o f   'contains'  'on top of between adjacent object components. new variables have  therefore  to be introduced. let x1  x1  and x1 be variables such that: x1  and x1  represent the left and right elements  object components   respectively  in a binary relation which relates any two adjacent components. their domains  h1 and h   are sets of 
numerical names of all object components which can be distinguished and uniquely named in any object: 
h1 = h1 = {1 ........... 1   where 1 represents a rectangle  1 - a triangle or a left triangle if there are two triangles  1 - a right triangle if there are two triangles  1 - a trapezoid  1 - a circle  1 - a left or upper circle if there are two circles  1 - the right or lower circle if there are two circles  f an ellipse; x1 represents binary relations between the values of x1 and x1  if these values are names of adjacent components in an object. its domain  hn  consists of numerical names of those relations  from a universe of relations which specialized procedures can detect   which actually appear between adjacent components in any object: ii . =  1 1  1   where 1 represents 'none of the relations holds' 1 - 'on the left of'   1 - 'contains'  1 - ' on top o f . 

	 t g  	 1  
where t - number of terms  and g - the degree of generalization  1   found using the gld representation o f f   i s : 
		 1  
　　　assuming the functional  t g  means t h a t we want to minimize the number of ' r u l e s ' which are needed to classify objects  terms in a formula   and also  w i t h secondary p r i o r i t y   we require a minimal 'degree of generalization' r e s u l t i n g from these r u l e s   . 
　　　it can be observed in table 1 that the event e =   1   1   1     which is the only event which s a t i s f i e s the second term of  1    can be removed from 
and the r e s u l t i n g representation r w i l l s t i l l be a d i s j o i n t representation of objects. therefore  the formula: 
		 1  
 which is the formula  1  without second term  is also a c l a s s i f i c a t i o n r u l e .  1  gives a r u l e : if a given object has a rectangle  trapezoid or e l l i p s e on top of two or one  out of two  circles  then it belongs to class 1  otherwise to class 1. 
　　　comparing  1  and  1  we can say that  1   though more complicated   i n sense of functional  t      gives additional information  which  if appropriately used  may speed up the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n process. 
　　　let us now assume as a cost functional the f u n c t i o n a l : 
		{1  
where s is the number of selectors and z the number of different variables. assuming t h i s functional means 
t h a t we want to obtain possibly simply description   i n the sense of  t s z   while permitting a greater generalization which may arise from i t . two minimal vl1 expressions for f under  t s z   assuming that does not include the event  1 1   e x i s t : 
 1  
 1  
 1  gives a r u l e : if in a given object  anything  since x1 was dropped  is on top of two or one  out of two  c i r c l e s   then it belongs to class 1  otherwise to class 1. gives a s i m i l a r r u l e : i f   in a given object  there are two circles not contained in anything  then it belongs to class 1  otherwise to class 1. 
　　　considering a l l of the above formally found r u l e s   it seems that they are close to what a human i n t u i t i o n could support as c l a s s i f i c a t i o n r u l e s . also  comparing  1  with  1   it seems that the measure of the 
'degree of g e n e r a l i z a t i o n '   specified by g  is relevant 
　　　since the obtained rules classify a l l objects c o r r e c t l y   there is no need to consider descriptions 
which use a l l eight variables. 
example 1 
　　　figure 1 shows two sets of small ' p i c t u r e s '   r1 and r   which represent certain objects from two classes  1 and 1  respectively. these ' p i c t u r e s ' are graphical notations of vectors {x1 x1 . ..  x1   where variables x 1   i = l   1   . . .   1   correspond t o picture elements as shown below: 




concluding remarks 
　　　1. presenter  concepts and the c l a s s i f i c n t i o r i method are of general a p p l i c a b i l i t y . they can  be especially useful in solving deterministic classification problems which are; 
- i n t r i n s i c a l l y nonlinear   e . g .   when each class is represented by a number of independent ' c l u s t e r s ' 
in a representation space  or 
-when variables are measured on nominal scale   i . e .   values of variables are labels  'numerical name .'  of certain independent objects and  therefore  arithmetic relationships between these values have ＊ 
no meaning  or ordinal scale  only order of variable values has meaning . thus  they can be applied beyond the area of a p p l i c a b i l i t y of conventional methods  such as l i n e a r  or nonlinear  discrimination techniques or s t a t i s t i c a l methods  
　　　1. the method automatically detects and reduces redundant variables. 
　　　1. c l a s s i f i c a t i o n rules in the form of vl1 expressions are very easy to i n t e r p r e t by humans and at the same time very convenient to evaluate by computers  especially using p a r a l l e l or p a r a l l e l sequential techniques . 
　　　1. although the synthesis of minimal vl1 expressions is a complex combinatorial problem  experimental results from program aqval/l prove that the execution time and memory requirements in s o l v i n g 'average s i z e ' problems are quite 
acceptable. 
　　　1. it is also worth noting that the method can be extended to cover the case of not completely specified events  i . e .   when some measurements are missing  what is a common s i t u a t i o n in a p p l i c a t i o n s     and  also  t h a t the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n rules  obtained based on some given data  can be easily modified if new information is given which is contradictive to the r u l e .
