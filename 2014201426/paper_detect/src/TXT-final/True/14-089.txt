　　stammers is a working rule-based system for i d e n t i f y i n g objects detected by sensors on board navy vessels and for interactively explaining the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n process. it is currently in use as a demonstration system at the riaval postgraduate school in monterey  california  and serves as the basis of continuing a r t i f i c i a l intelligence development e f f o r t s at the naval ocean systems 
center. 
　　many rule-based systems u t i l i z e a data base which is fixed and regarded as complete  except for 
inferences added by the system i t s e l f . in contrast  stammer  operates in an environment which is never complete and where later information may supersede or even negate earlier data. others also deal with the issues of incomplete and inconsistent data  but propose solutions d i f f e r i n g from those adopted in stammer1. besides handling unstable information  stammer1 is required to process large amounts of data as it is received. this combination of constraints introduces problems for 
which novel solutions have been adopted. 
　　stammer1 operates on a data base of assertions r e l a t i n g to ocean-going c r a f t . periodically  packets of information in the form of messages are added to the data base. the unsolicited nature of data entry suggests a data-driven approach  and the rule interpreter operates primarily in a bottom-up  
forward-chaining mode. to f a c i l i t a t e the bottom-up processing  inference proceeds in an incremental fashion. that i s   a rule may be p a r t i a l l y evaluated on the basis of currently available information. the evaluation is then suspended and may be revived when further relevant information is received. this technique eliminates duplication of e f f o r t by the rule interpreter. an implication of t h i s approach is that if later information s a t i s f i e s the remaining conditions of a rule in a prior context  then that context is recalled and the rule f i n a l l y f i r e s . 
　　the confidence computation mechanism  while using formulas similar to those of mycin  has three novel aspects. the f i r s t two  cycle breaking and 
　　this work performed in part while the author was employed by sdc integrated services under nosc contract n1--c-1 
invalidation of earlier inferences by later information  are a result of a dynamic confidence calculation which is undertaken only on request. confidences are not stored. the t h i r d innovation is the introduction of an  unless  l o g i c a l operator to permit default inferences based on an absence of information. 
　　a f a c i l i t y is provided for the system to explain the reasoning underlying i t s inferences. for t h i s purpose  stored with each system inferred assertion is a  derivation record  which contains a l l the r u l e s and p a r t i c u l a r c o n d i t i o n s a t i s f i e r s w h i c h p a r t i c i p a t e i n c o n c l u d i n g t h e a s s e r t i o n .
