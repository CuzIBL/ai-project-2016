1. 	introduction 
　　this paper describes the representations of knowledge used by a program which solves physics problems stated in e n g l i s h . 	rather than using a s i n g l e uniform r e p r e s e n t a t i o n   the program uses a 
　　number of d i f f e r e n t r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s   each of which 
is s p e c i a l i z e d f o r a p a r t i c u l a r t a s k   e . g .   	l a n guage syntax  	language semantics  representing objects and t h e i r a t t r i b u t e s and r e l a t i o n s h i p s   representing objects as canonical objects used in p h y s i c s   modelling geometry  and s o l v i n g equa-
t i o n s . many of these representations are based on the n o t i o n of frames  minsky 1   . the use of spec i a l i z e d representations s i m p l i f i e s many of the 
processes which must be performed by the program; however  	it requires that the program be able to t r a n s l a t e between the various representations when necessary. 	procedural knowledge is required to convert one r e p r e s e n t a t i o n i n t o another  	since it f r e q u e n t l y happens that i n f o r m a t i o n which is ess e n t i a l i n the t a r g e t representation i s unspecif i e d o r i s s p e c i f i e d only i m p l i c i t l y i n the source r e p r e s e n t a t i o n ; 	inferences are required t o f i l l i n such i n f o r m a t i o n . 	specialized representations allow procedures to be attached to p a r t i c u l a r types of r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s   both to convert them to other types and to solve problems which are associated w i t h the s p e c i a l i z e d area. 	in t h i s paper

draw p i c t u r e s of physics problems stated in engl i s h . representative examples of the class of problems solved by the program are shown in figures 1 and 1. the program has solved a t o t a l of twenty problems in the area of r i g i d body s t a t i c s   most of which were taken verbatim from high school and college physics t e x t s . 
　　the understanding and s o l u t i o n of such a problem proceeds in several d i s t i n c t steps. the f i r s t step i s   of course  the understanding of the engl i s h sentences of the problem statement. the sentences are parsed i n t o a case-structured semant i c network form by an augmented t r a n s i t i o n net grammar  which is aided by a large number of semantic programs. semantic processing is i n t e r woven w i t h the parsing process. structures p r o duced by the parser  which i n i t i a l l y correspond c l o s e l y to s y n t a c t i c forms  are made progressively more semantic as the parsing proceeds. one major semantic process is r e f e r e n t i d e n t i f i c a t i o n   in which a phrase is i d e n t i f i e d w i t h the object or r e l a t i o n s h i p t o which i t corresponds i n the p r o gram's developing model of the problem. a second major semantic process is the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of a type of conceptual e n t i t y  such as a l o c a t i o n or a t t r i b u t e   which is referenced by a phrase. procedures associated w i t h each type of semantic frame allow inferences to be made to f i l l   s l o t s   in the semantic frame whose values are unspecif i e d ; f o r example  the phrase  at one end  impll-rc i t l y references an unspecified physical o b j e c t   
whose i d e n t i t y must be i n f e r r e d to complete the meaning of the semantic frame. the f i n a l step in the semantic processing of a sentence is the execut i o n of the verb semantics. at the time when the semantic r o u t i n e f o r a verb is executed  the case arguments of the verb w i l l t y p i c a l l y be represented as semantic frames  as opposed to syntacticphrases ; t h i s representation g r e a t l y s i m p l i f i e s the processing of verbs. execution of verb semant i c s t y p i c a l l y causes the t r a n s f e r of new informat i o n to e x i s t i n g objects in the i n t e r n a l model of the problem  or causes the c r e a t i o n in the model of new objects and r e l a t i o n s h i p s . 
　　a f t e r a l l of the sentences of the problem statement have been read and processed semantically  the i n f o r m a t i o n conveyed by the sentences w i l l have been t r a n s f e r r e d to a language-free i n t e r n a l model  and the s t r u c t u r e s produced in parsing the sentences w i l l have been discarded. the i n t e r n a l model contains representations of physical objects   e . g .   l a d d e r s   ropes  and persons   features or aspects of objects   e . g .   l o c a t i o n s     and r e l a t i o n ships among objects   e . g .   attachment r e l a t i o n s     
　　in order to solve the physics problem  it is necessary to associate a canonical object frame w i t h each p h y s i c a l object in the problem  a canoni c a l object frame is an i d e a l i z a t i o n or abstraction of c e r t a i n features of an a c t u a l o b j e c t   such as a r i g i d body or a p o i n t mass. physical laws are def i n e d in terms of these i d e a l i z e d canonical objects  which only approximate the behavior of r e a l objects. the canonical object frame to be used f o r an object depends on the o b j e c t ' s c o n t e x t ; t h u s   a person might be modelled as a p i v o t when c a r r y i n g a plank  or as a point mass when s i t t i n g on a plank. there are procedures associated w i t h each type of canon*i c a l object which t e s t f o r the presence of necessary features and make appropriate inferences f o r features which are missing. for example  if the weight of a r i g i d body is unknown  it is assumed to be zero; if the length is unknown  the assumpt i o n is made that the object must have a f i n i t e l e n g t h   and a symbolic constant is created to r e present the l e n g t h . 
　　a geometric model is created to r e l a t e the posit i o n s of the objects in the problem to a common coordinate system. knowledge of the p r o t o t y p i c a l geometry of each object is used to create a comp o s i t e geometric model by combining the geometric models of i n d i v i d u a l objects at p o i n t s of a t t a c h ment . in some cases  t h i s requires mapping f e a tures of objects  such as the distance between two points  i n t o a formal system  such as a t r i angle    s o l v i n g a problem in the formal system  and mapping the r e s u l t s back to the o r i g i n a l obj e c t   f o r example  d e f i n i n g the size of an object based on the computed distance between two p o i n t s on the o b j e c t   . 
　　a f t e r canonical object frames have been selected for each object and the geometric model has been constructed  equations are w r i t t e n to describe the i n t e r a c t i o n s of the objects according to p h y s i c a l laws. these equations are solved by a small symb o l i c manipulation package  and an answer to the question asked in the problem statement is generated from the equation s o l u t i o n s . 
　　the l a s t step performed by the program is the generation of a p i c t u r e model and a diagram of the problem. the p i c t u r e model is s i m i l a r to the geometric model; however  it is necessary to d e t e r mine reasonable sizes in the drawing for objects which have no geometric size  for example  a person who is modelled as a p o i n t mass   and to i n f e r reasonable p o i n t s of attachment when they are uns p e c i f i e d   f o r example  the point of attachment f o r a person whose canonical object frame is pivot is assumed to be hands . f i n a l l y   the composite drawing must be scaled to f i t the a v a i l a b l e p i c ture area. 
1. 	understanding english sentences 
　　parsing of the english sentences of the problem statement is c o n t r o l l e d by an augmented t r a n s i t i o n network grammar  woods 1   . rather than using a grammar i n t e r p r e t e r   the grammar is implemented d i r e c t l y as a set of lisp f u n c t i o n s   using a set of small system functions to c o n t r o l movement of the scanner and to provide automatic backup when an attempted parsing f a i l s . the grammar f u n c t i o n s in the parser b u i l d s t r u c t u r e s whiqh represent the content of the phrase being parsed  or make changes t o already e x i s t i n g s t r u c t u r e s . i n a d d i t i o n   the parsing functions f r e q u e n t l y make c a l l s to semantic r o u t i n e s ; a grammar f u n c t i o n may f a i l on semantic grounds even though it succeeded in parsing tne desired s y n t a c t i c c o n s t r u c t . 
1 　　the s t r u c t u r e s produced by the parser i n i t i a l l y bear a strong resemblance to semantic networks as used by simmons  simmons 1     these s t r u c t u r e s are not produced f o r a l l s y n t a c t i c c o n s t r u c t s   but only f o r those which represent l a r g e r u n i t s of meaning   p r i m a r i l y noun phrases and verb phrases . as the parsing continues  the parse s t r u c t u r e s are made r . - 1 : novak 
progressively more semantic and less syntactic  u n t i l f i n a l l y the meaning of a phrase is extracted and incorporated into the internal model or into the semantic structure of another phrase; thereafter  the parse structure is no longer used  with the exception of possible later use for finding 
pronoun referents . rather than being representations of the meanings of phrases  these parse structures may be considered to be temporary structures 
where the information provided by the syntactic parsing may be stored in a readily accessible form u n t i l sufficient context has been collected to allow the semantics of the phrase to be determined the form and use of the parse structures are shown later in this section  where the complete processing for an example sentence is outlined. 
   as the processing of a noun phrase proceeds  the phrase w i l l generally be identified as an instance of a semantic frame. the semantic frame designation specifies the type of conceptual entity denoted by the phrase  e.g.  physent  physical entity  attrof  attribute-of   or locpart  location/part . in addition  the semantic frame contains  slots  for the  arguments  of the frame; for example  the attribute-of semantic frame contains slots for the name of the attribute  e.g.  length  and the referent object  that i s   the object in the internal 
model of the problem  with which the attribute is associated. if the values of essential slots in the semantic frame are not specified explicitly in a sentence  procedures associated with the semantic frame can examine the internal model of the problem 
and make the inferences necessary to f i l l in the missing values. such inferences are frequently required when  for example  a location is named without the object with which it is associated  as in  the center  or  one end . thus  the procedures associated with a semantic frame perform the dual functions of determining when a conceptual entity is incompletely specified and providing specialist programs to complete the specifications by making appropriate inferences. 
   the use of semantic frames greatly simplifies the processing required for  higher-level  semantic routines which reference multiple phrases  such as the semantic routines for verbs and prepositions. a single type of conceptual entity  such as a location  may .be denoted by a variety of syntactic forms; by identifying the type of conceptual entity and collecting the arguments of the semantic frame into a standard form  making inferences as required    a l l of these syntactic forms are converted to an identical semantic frame form. thus  the higher-level semantic routines may directly access the attributes of the conceptual entity without 
being concerned with the syntactic form which was used to specify that entity. 
　　phrases in a sentence frequently refer  either explicitly or implicitly  to objects in the program's developing model of the problem. referent identification is the process of determining the object s  in the internal model to which a phrase refers. the referenced  object  may be a physical object  an attribute of a physical object  such as a location   or a relationship  such as an attachment between two physical objects ; there is a set of specialist routines for identifying referents 
of each type. referent identification is in general a very d i f f i c u l t problem  chamiak 1 ; even in the microworld of physics problems  the processes for identifying referents are f a i r l y complex. first  it is necessary to determine whether a phrase refers to an existing object in the model  or whether a new object must be created and added to the model. if the model contains more than one possible referent  it is necessary to select the correct one s ; this selection may be specified in the sentence by means of an attribute value   the left end  ...  the other end    or an intenslonal description   the load   i . e .   the object which is being carried . when the referent identification process is complete  the  referent  which is returned is a l i s t of the objects in the internal model to which the phrase refers. the various semantic frame forms have slots for the referent of the semantic frame and/or the object the semant i c frame is about  e.g.  the object whose a t t r i bute is referenced. in many cases  the referent constitutes the entire meaning of the phrase; thus  a phrase like  one end of a pole  has a meaning in isolation  even though it is not an acceptable sentence   namely  the pointer to the location object in the internal model to which the phrase refers. once again  the use of semantic frames and the referent identification process relieve higjierlevel semantic  routines of the burden of knowing how a referent was specified; these routines need only deal with the pointer to the referent object in the internal model. 
　　the structures produced by the parser and the structures created in the internal model in response to an example sentence are shown in figures 1 and a  respectively. each word which is underlined represents a lisp gensym atom; the columns below the atom names are the indicator/value pairs from the atom's property l i s t . the numbered state-
ments below describe the sequence of events in processing the example sentence; the numbers shown in the figures correspond to this sequence  and i n d i cate the position of the scanner as the sentence is parsed  or the time at which atoms are created or new information is added to their property l i s t s . 
1. the i n i t i a l noun phrase  one end  is parsed  producing the structure t1 with i t s f i r s t four properties. 
1 the prepositional phrase parser causes the noun phrase  a pole  to be parsed  producing the structure t1 with i t s f i r s t four properties. 
1. the phrase  1 ft long  causes a modifier to be added to t1. 
1. the preposition semantics routine for of is called with t1 and t1 as arguments. by means of a discrimination net using tests on 
these arguments  this particular instance of the use of of is classified as being of the form   location  of  object  . 
1. the function idrfnt is called to identify the referent of  a pole . 	this causes t1 to be assigned the semantic frame physent  physical entity   and causes the object p1le1 to be added to the internal model. 	p1le1 is added to tok1 as i t s referent.

1. the semantic routine for of next assigns the 
semantic frame locpart  location/part  to t1 and f i l l s the semantic object slot of this frame with the referent of the phrase 
which was the object of the preposition  i.e.  the l i s t  p1le1 . note that since the meaning of t1 has been extracted and used  t1 is no longer a part of the parse structure. 
1. the verb phrase parser is called  with t1 as the syntactic subject argument . 	since the verb phrase is passive  t1 is attached to the verb token structure t1 as the obj case argument. 
1. the prepositional phrase parser causes the noun phrase  a man  to be parsed  generating the structure t1.  man  is defined in terms of an underlying concept   person   with modifiers. 
1. the preposition semantics routine for by calls 
idrfnt to identify the referent of a  man ; 
this causes t1 to be assigned the semantic frame physent  and causes a new object pers1 to be added to the internal model as i t s referent. 
1. the verb semantics for the verb support are called; this routine sees a structure of the form  physent  support  locpart . 
1. the location object l1 is added to the internal model and specified as the referent of t1. 
1. the semantic routine for the verb support calls the function idatt to identify an attachment relation between p1le1 at location l1 and pers1  location unknown ; this causes the creation of the attachment relation attach1. 
1. 	canonical object frames 
   a canonical object frame represents an idealization of an actual object as a canonical object 
whose behavior approximates the behavior of the idealized aspects of the actual object. for example  in a physics problem  a man standing on a plank might be modelled as a point mass canonical object. a canonical object frame does not represent a superset of the actual object  typically represented by an isa link in semantic networks   but rather represents a  view  of the object in the sense of  bobrow and winograd 1   in a large a . i . system  a complex object such as a person might be modelled by a variety of canonical object frames  each of which would represent some aspect of the person; in our microworld of physics problems  each object is modelled  within a single problem  as a single canonical object. the types of canonical object frames which may be used to represent an object depend upon i t s context; a person would be modelled as a pivot object when carrying a plank rather than standing on i t   
　　in order to model an object using a canonical object frame  it is necessary to select the appropriate frame  and then to abstract the characteristics of the object which are required for the frame representation. selection of the pro-
per frame is done by specialist programs for the type of problem area  in this case  physics problems  . the specialist programs know what types of canonical objects might be appropriate representations for each type of actual object; selection of the proper one is done by examining the context of the object  e.g.  how many objects it is attached to  whether it supports something or is supported or is attached to something that supports something  etc. . 
　　in general  a mapping function is required to abstract the features of an object for use in i t s corresponding canonical object frame. the necessary features may be specified implicitly  or in a different form from that which is needed  or they may not be specified at a l l   for example  in the problem shown in figure 1  the length of the pole and the weight of the weight are unspecified; the values of these necessary attributes must be i n ferred  in this case  by creating symbolic constants for them  in order to complete the canonical object frame representations. a second set of 

knowledge repr.-1: novak 1 

mapping functions may be needed to translate the results of reasoning processes performed on the canonical objects into the form required for the  actual  object representations  and to propagate the consequences of the new results. 
　　the advantage of viewing an actual object as a canonical object is that canonical objects interact with each other in precisely specified ways. the information about the actual object which may be used in an attempt to solve a problem is restricted to those aspects of the object which were abstracted to form the canonical object frame  which greatly reduces the size of the problem space compared to a uniform representation in 
which a l l information is equally accessible. 	in addition  specialist procedures may be attached to a canonical object frame type to specify the interactions with other canonical objects and to solve special problems which occur frequently. 	in the physics problem solver  the interactions of canonical objects obey physical laws which are expressed as equations; these laws include those taught in physics texts  e.g.  the laws of rigid body statics  as well as other physical laws which are  obvious   e.g.  the tension forces exerted at the ends of a rope are equal in magnitude  nonnegative  and directed toward the center of the rope . 	the specialist procedures associated with each type of canonical object examine the objectrs relationships with other objects and write equations which describe the interactions of the objects; solution of the set of generated equations yields the answer to the problem. 
　　as an example of the use of canonical object frames  consider the man standing on the ladder in the problem of figure 1  the problem statement says only that  a 1 lb. man is 1 f t . from the top ; in order to solve the problem correctly  the program must determine what role the man plays in this particular problem. it is inadequate to assume that a man w i l l always play a single role  since in the problem of figure 1 the man is carrying the pole rather than standing' on i t . in order to choose the correct canonical object frame  the context of the man is examined: he is attached  in some way  to the ladder  which is known to be supported at two points; therefore  the ladder is assumed to support the man  and a  point mass  canonical object frame is chosen. choosing the correct canonical object frame is essential to solving a problem correctly: if the wrong one is chosen  it is likely to cause unsolvable equations to be written  or to cause essential information to be left out of the equations  so that the answer w i l l be wrong. 
　　the use of canonical object frames is an important respect in which this program differs from the earlier programs student  bobrow 1  and carps  chamiak 1 . in student  which solved algebra word problems  the words or phrases between keywords were directly reduced to algebraic variables  without any analysis of the meanings of the words  in fact  nonsense words could be used . in carps  which solved calculus word problems  equations 
were associated directly with object names  for ex-
	1 	1 	1 
ample  x 	+ y = 1 	was associated with ladder . these direct associations caused these earlier programs to f a i l on problems which were otherwise within their a b i l i t i e s because an object played a  role1' different from the one which the program assumed. by the use of canonical object frames  isaac separates the role played by an object from the representation of the object i t s e l f   so that a single object can play different roles in different contexts. parts or features of an object may be abstracted. for example  the imaginary line between two points on a ladder may form one side of a triangle; it is not necessary that the entire ladder be a side. 
1. geometric model 
　　in order to write equations describing the i n teractions of the objects in a physics problem  it is necessary to construct a geometric model which relates positions on objects to a common coordinate system. geometric models for individual objects are constructed by using prototype geometric models for each type of object; a prototype geometry is parameterized by the rotation of the object  the offset of the object relative to a larger geometric model  and scale factors for the x and y coordinates. given the relative positions of locations on an object in the prototype geometry  it is easy to calculate the coordinates of a location on an  actual  object using simple vector geometry. 
　　the composite geometric model is constructed from the individual geometric models by requiring that the coordinates of two points attached to each other be equal; thus  if an object is to be added to the composite model  it is only necessary to recalculate i t s offset so that i t s point of attachment w i l l have the coordinates of the. corresponding point in the composite model. however  if several objects are connected so that they form a triangle  and the sizes or rotations of some of the objects are unknown  this simple method is i n adequate. in this case  it is necessary to map the known line segment lengths and angles into a canonical triangle form  solve the triangle  and map the results back to give the desired rotations and object sizes. 
1. conclusion 
knowledge repr.-1: novak 1 　　the program for solving physics problems which is described in this paper makes frequent use of the notion of frames  minsky 1   in our implementation  frames may be considered to be interpretations or  views  of other objects  which then allow problem solving by specialist programs which know how to deal with the canonical objects represented by the frames; a diagram and example of this process are shown below. 

in t h i s h y p o t h e t i c a l example  the   a b s t r a c t i o n mapping  creates representations of l i n e segments  none of which  presumably  existed in the o r i g i n a l representation  to form a canonical t r i a n g l e model; the t r i a n g l e can then be solved 
by a s p e c i a l i s t program f o r t r i a n g l e s   and the r e s u l t can be mapped back i n t o the o r i g n i a l r e p r e s e n t a t i o n   e . g .   by d e f i n i n g the x c o o r d i nate of p  if the coordinates of p1 are known . 
　　the n o t i o n of canonical object frames is a powerful technique f o r c o n s t r u c t i n g problems o l v i n g systems. by separating the r e c o g n i t i o n and a b s t r a c t i o n processes from the formal problem s o l v i n g system  it allows the l a t t e r to be w r i t t e n c l e a n l y and e f f i c i e n t l y   without regard f o r the s p e c i f i c s to which it may be a p p l i e d . an e x i s t i n g formal problem-solving system may be used w i t h a new type of object simply by adding a r o u t i n e to i n t e r p r e t the new object as the appropriate canonical o b j e c t . by r e s t r i c t i n g access to both procedures and d a t a   the canoni c a l object frame reduces the size of the problem space w i t h which the problem solver must contend  and keeps i r r e l e v a n t knowledge from being accessed. 
　　this n o t i o n of the a b s t r a c t i o n of a small number of p r o p e r t i e s of an a c t u a l object to form a r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of a canonical object is basic to the sciences and to engineering. indeed  
major s c i e n t i f i c advances   e . g .   coordinate geometry  newtonian mechanics  atomic theory  p h r a s e - s t r u c t u r e grammar  have g e n e r a l l y been accompanied by the i n t r o d u c t i o n of new types of canonical objects w i t h which the t h e o r i e s d e a l . laws such as those of newtonian mechanics d e r i v e t h e i r great power from t h e i r a b i l i t y t o p r e d i c t the behavior of any p h y s i c a l object on the basis of only a few a t t r i b u t e s   e . g .   the o b j e c t ' s mass and the r e s u l t a n t of the forces on i t   the p r a c t i c e s of engineering are h e a v i l y based upon the use of canonical object models; f o r example  an i n t e g r a t e d c i r c u i t is described in terms of 
at least seven canonical models: a l o g i c model  a geometric model and topology model of the c i r c u i t package  a thermal model  a t i m i n g model  a power consumption model  and a c i r c u i t model  which in t u r n is expressed in terms of canonical objects such as t r a n s i s t o r s and lumped r e s i s t a n ces  . 
　　we believe that the o r g a n i z a t i o n of knowledge in terms of canonical object frames w i t h a s s o c i ated s p e c i a l i s t procedures f o r s o l v i n g problems in p a r t i c u l a r areas is basic to a v a r i e t y of d i s c i p l i n e s  not only physics and engineering  but also such d i s c i p l i n e s as medicine and l a w     and that i t has considerable p o t e n t i a l f o r a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e programs as w e l l . the nature of the procedures which recognize an a c t u a l object as an instance of a canonical object and construct the mappings between the model of the object and the canonical object frame is an important area f o r f u t u r e research.
