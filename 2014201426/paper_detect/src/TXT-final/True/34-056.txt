       f i n a l l y   one important consideration in the design of a sentence completion program should be mentioned. in examples el and e1  the reader is provided with a set of choices for what could go in each of the blanks. in e1  the reader must generate a f i l l e r without a set of possible f i l l e r s . in the implementation discussed below  i have designed the program so that it is unaware of any set of preselected possible answers. it may have been possible to design the program so that the computer would check each choice given and choose the one that matched the context most completely. although humans o f t e n use the technique of checking the l i s t of answers and reading through the sentence completion question with each choice in place of the blank  they are also capable of performing the task without this  backward search  from answers to questions. in fact exams given before the use of machine scoring did not have a l i s t of choices. i have disregarded the backward search approach chiefly because i think it is subordinate to the general problem of choosing a f i l l e r f o r a blank with a whole data base of words that are  possible  answers. 
implementation 
the f i r s t step of the implementation is processing the sentences of the test paragraph. this process reduces a sentence from one s t r i n g of input to several different simpler pieces of information which are l i s t e d on an observations l i s t  oust  f o r s h o r t   . the kind of information produced from this phase is l i s t e d below from the sentence  tom's cat had f i v e k i t t e n s   : 
1. semantic classes for tom  cat and kittens. 
1. fact that tom possesses the cat. 
1. fact that the cat is parent to the kittens  
1. number of kittens is f i v e . 
1. tense of fact #1 is past. 
1. a series of special numbers to denote the uniqueness of tom  cat and kittens. 
       in the next stage  each fact on the olist is matched to the a c t i o n p o r t i o n of a s e r i e s of scenarios. if a match is found and the conditions on the weight are met  the free variables of the scenario are bound to the nouns in the fact from the olist. the resulting instantiation of the scenario p a t t e r n is then added to a scenario l i s t . the process is then repeated for every fact of the olist. 
       adding an instantiated scenario pattern to the s c e n a r i o l i s t is done by means of synthesis  a technique of pople   1   . the scenario pattern is matched to other scenario ps++as on the scenario l i s t . several differen and occur during the matching routine but will not be discussed here. for d i s c u s s i o n see bullwinkle   1   . hatching has three purposes: 
1. to avoid duplicating scenario patterns on the scenario l i s t . scenario patterns on the scenario l i s t are considered the same when they have the same pattern and the same bindings for the variables of the scenario pattern. 
1. to determine which actions on the olist evoked the same scenario pattern several times. 
1. to sum together the evoking strengths of t h o s e a c t i o n s of 1  and a s s o c i a t e the resulting weight with the scenario pattern. when a l l facts of the olist have been matched  the scenario with the largest weight is chosen as the probable scenario. it often happens in running this process that more than one scenario w i l l have equal or n e a r l y equal large numerical weights. for purposes of distinguishing between these and also for m o d e l l i n g a l l the events possible of the t e s t paragraph  a partitioning phase occurs next. 
       for each scenario with large numerical weight  the r e s t of the scenarios on the scenario l i s t are p a r t i t i o n e d in major and minor l i s t s using the p r i n c i p l e of dominance  see pople   defined here a s : scenario a dominates scenario b if the set of sentences which evoked a is a subset of the sentences which evoked b. the major l i s t contains scenarios which e i t h e r dominate or are dominated by the p r o b a b l e s c e n a r i o . scenarios on the major l i s t represent alternatives to the probable scenario for explaining the test paragraph. the minor l i s t can be viewed as a set of scenarios which when combined with the probable scenario explain more than any scenario can separately. each scenario on the minor l i s t is reviewed to see if it is an embedded scenario of the probable scenario. those scenarios that are embedded are s a i d to be c a u s a l l y l i n k e d to the probable scenario  and their weights are added to the weight of the probable scenario. the major-minor l i s t construction is repeated for each probable scenario and the one with the highest weight is then chosen as the most probable scenario. 
       from the most probable scenario  the blank in the sentence can be f i l l e d . this is accomplished in one of two ways. when a most probable scenario is chosen  the sentence with the blank is matched against that scenario pattern. if there is a match  a binding for the blank is selected. if there is no match  then the value for the binding of the blank is chosen o f f a special stack called the blank bindings stack of the scenario. the stack uis f i l l e d in the f o l l o w i n g way. during the process of evoking s c e n a r i o p a t t e r n s   a v a r i a b l e   c a l l e d the blank v a r i a b l e   which represents the sentence blank  can become bound to a scenario variable. the scenario v a r i a b l e may also be bound to a word from the t e s t paragraph  and so the blank variable  takes on  the sentence word as i t s value. when this happens  a copy of the blank variable and i t s value are put into the blank bindings stack. the stack is then used as indicated above: to select a f i l l e r for the blank. note that several bindings for a blank variable may be in the s t a c k . only the top one is chosen. f i n a l l y   the f i l l e r for the blank is submitted to a p o s t - p r o c e s s o r to check f o r such s y n t a c t i c 
       constraints as number of the noun or verb  tense of verbs and a r t i c l e agreement and semantic constraints such as the semantic class of nouns so that certain n o n s e n s e c h o i c e s are thrown o u t . a s m a l l   unsophisticated processor has been implemented to do some of these tasks. 
       in the above discussion  a l l phases have been implemented except the process which reduces a sentence from one string to several simpler pieces of information. this portion of the program was hands i m u l a t e d i n t h e cases g i v e n below and i t s implementation is a subject of further research. 
some real cases 
the above implementation  written in lisp  has been run on example e1  a modified version of e1 given below as e1  and on e1 and e1. 
e1  it was a lovely  sunny morning. father came home with bags of groceries. mother made sandwiches and cookies. bob and betty were happy as they piled baskets of good things to eat in the car. were going on a 	. 
e1  have you ever heard of a l i b r a r y without books  there is such a library  owned by a motion p i c t u r e company  that contains 

1 

nothing but h a i r . it has more than 1 p i e c e s - - w i g s   mustaches and beards in s t y l e s of many years  past and present. the n e x t t i m e you see your f a v o r i t e brunette actress appear on the screen as a blond  either she may have had her hair bleached  or more l i k e l y   she is wearing a from this .   1   

in e1  and e1 reasonable choices art made. the program chooses  bob and betty  and  bob and betty  mother and father  respectively for blank #b1  and 
 picnic  for #b1. while the actual f i l l e r should be   t h e y     t h i s choice is implementable in a postprocessor with heuristics that t a l l it to use a pronoun of correct number and case if several words are to be put in one blank space. it is important for text explanation  however  that the program know who  they  refers to and hence the choices which were made are significant. in example e1  the blanks are f i l l e d from the scenario  init go-on x picnic  with x bound to  bob and betty . the minor l i s t for this scenario provides no new information for f i l l i n g the blanks. in example e1  the same scenario is chosen as the most probable scenario although x in that case is bound to  bob and betty  mother and father . one scenario on the minor l i s t is of interest:  comp goon x shopping-trip-grocery-store  with x bound to  father . the program has determined that father has been grocery shopping and this information is accounted for in the scenario of picnicking by use of the minor l i s t . 
　　　again in example e1 choices for the blank are the expected ones:  wig  for #b1 and  library  for #bz. the choices for the blank come from the most probable scenario chosen for e1 which is  perf wearfrom x wig z  with x bound to  actress  and z to  library.  however  it is not until after the minor l i s t of this scenario is checked that the binding for z is made. on the minor l i s t is the scenario   i n i t borrow-from x y library  with x unbound and y bound to  wig . when this scenario becomes causally linked to  perf wear-from x wig z   z becomes bound to   l i b r a r y   . this example shows the importance of embedded scenarios in binding variables for f i l l i n g the blank. 
　　　example e1 does not produce the expected results since it fails to choose the scenario which explains the most events and thes it provides incorrect f i l l e r s for the blank. its failure points out the current limitations of the b l a n k f i l l l n g process implementation. 
　　　f i r s t   the use of weights requires a certain amount of tuning to determine what values for weights should be used and whether these should be summed in a linear or non-linear fashion. an alternative to the use of weights and the problems associated with tuning would be to eliminate the use of weights entirely in favor of a process that relies solely on the number of facts in the paragraph that it can explain. 
　　　second  the present implementation of minor l i s t s l i m i t s the causal links between embedded scenarios to a depth of one. this limitation is required to prevent the program from searching i n f i n i t e l y when looking for causal links between scenarios. however  in example e1  the causal link 
between the f a c t t h a t tom is scratched and the scenario of the cat having k i t t e n s is embedded too deeply f o r the current version of the minor l i s t to f i n d . 
       t h i r d   synthesis on scenario l i s t s at present does not permit scenario patterns with different time designations to establish a l i n k with t h e i r common parent node. thus the scenario patterns   i n i t go-on tom picnic  and  perf go-on tom picnic  should become linked to the parent node  go-on tom picnic  without a time reference. establishment of this link would evoke the general idea of going on a picnic more strongly than either of two sub-parts of i n i t i a t i o n or performance. since the parent scenario w i l l obtain i t s weight from a combination of the weights of i t s sub-parts  evoking the parent scenario could r u l e out some other scenario as the most probable scenario for the test example. 
conclusion 
in t h i s paper i have presented some examples of how scenarios can be used in the sentence completion t a s k . i have i l l u s t r a t e d the processes needed to o b t a i n the scenario and f i l l the blanks as w e l l as p o i n t e d out some r e m a i n i n g research problems involved. it is worthwhile to note here that the use of scenarios in a task such as blankfilllng reveals much of the assumed knowledge required of people in performing language related tasks. the scenario represents graphically the information which must be a c q u i r e d in order f o r a person to understand a p a r t i c u l a r c o n c e p t and use i t i n l a n g u a g e comprehension. in p a r t i c u l a r   people not f a m i l i a r with picnicking customs may not draw the conclusion of   p i c n i c   upon reading example e1 even though their r e a d i n g comprehension of english is adequate. additional research with scenarios shows promise of p r o v i d i n g us w i t h a b e t t e r understanding of the  common sense  knowledge often assumed as part of language s k i l l s .
