 
when planning systems deal with realistic domains  they must cope with a large variety of constraints imposed by the environment such as temporal or resource constraints the robustness of the generated plan is a direct consequence of a correct handling of these constraints we argue that increasing the expressiveness of a representation can be achieved without fundamentally affecting the global efficiency of the search this paper presents a temporal planner  lxtet  which integrates sharable resource management into the process of plan generation in ixtet  planning operators are described as temporal structures of conditions  effects and sharable resource uses during the search  pending subgoals  protection threats and resource conflicts are detected by three flaw analysis modules the detection of sharable resource conflicts is performed thanks to an efficient clique-search algorithm on a possible intersection graph the control of the search is based on a least-commitment opportunistic strategy our approach has been implemented  tested and shown to be satisfactory in various application domains 
1 	introduction 
classical approaches decompose plan generation and resource management into two different steps for solving a given planning problem plan generation consists in selecting and organising a set of operators that will achieve the problem goals  its result is a plan  that is a partially ordered set of operators resource management is then performed on this plan to ensure its correctness with respect to temporal and resource constraints the result  then  is a schedule that  if executed  will ensure the goal resolution while satisfying the physical constraints of the environment 
　the strict separation between plan generation and re source management raises difficulties such as how to backtrack to the plan generation process  when necessary  or how to generate the plan in an opportunistic way according to resource constraints 
　this paper develops a representation and an algorithmic approach integrated into a system called ixtet  for handling abreast and in an opportunistic way plan generation and time/resource management 
　the following section is a short digest of scheduling and planning literature that influenced our work section 1 describes a temporal representation of operators and problems the genera  control of the planner is discussed m section 1 whereas section 1 focuses on the resource analysis module we finally presents some experimental results and applicability domains for our system

scheduling systems are essentially concerned with time and resource management isis  fox and smith  1  was one of the first attempt to deal with a large variety of realistic constraints for job-shop scheduling some operator pre-conditions were handled to detect inconsistency but nothing was done to enforce their aatiafaction other systems like opis  smith et a/  1  or micro-boss  sadeh  1  introduced the notion of opportunistic search that is the ability to dynamically 
revise the search procedure in their approach  this consists in choosing first to schedule the most constrained operations l e those with the highest contribution to resource bottlenecks systems like opal  bensana et al  1  or mascot  erechler et al  1  work out a constraint based analysis to detect some necessary features of the solutions represented by the current partial schedule in these approaches  opportunity of a conflict resolution depends on the number and characteristics  of the different ways to solve it the resource manager of ixtet has been highly influenced by the latter approaches as an opportunistic search is made necessary by the plan generation aspects the system deals with 
1 	planning 
the algorithmic basis of classical planning have been well clarified  eg in  chapman  1  and  mcailester and 
rosenblitt  1  
　extending the classical representation to handle temporal constraints like operator durations or earliest latest time  has been an important preoccupation in planning like forbin  dean et al   1  or o-plan  cur 
laborie and ghallab 
re and tate  1   ixtet uses time-points as primitives and propagates metric constraints between time-points this has been shown to be less complex  vilain and 
kautz  1  than interval based approaches  allen et 
1  
　concerning resource management  sipe was the first planner to handle consumable and producible resources  wilkins  1  although no constraint was added to the plan to prevent potential resource conflicts  the search space was pruned to avoid some unuseful exploration of over-consumer plans sipe also implemented the notion of unsharable re-usab e resources 
　because theu management is inherently untractable  shamble rtsourcts has rarely been integrated into a planning system the hsts framework  muscetolla  1  addresses this problem however  it over-constrains the current partial plan as sharable resources are handled through a total-ordered time-line o-plan handles sharable resources by using a criterion based on optimistic and pessimistic resource profiles  drabble and tate  1  to prune the search space but these profiles seem not to be sufficient to ensure the soundness of the search with respect to resource conflicts 
　this paper presents a sound  complete and efficient least-commitment based approach to manage sharable resources during the planning process the approach redes on various techniques and ideas from classical planning  scheduling  constraint satisfaction problems and graph theory it develops an original procedure for managing efficiently and jointly temporal and resource constraints it has been integrated with a sophisticated control into the ixtet temporal planner 
1 	representation 1 	time and variables 
for algorithmic complexity reasons  the ixtet ttmc-map manager  ghallab and alaoui  1  ghallab and vidal  
1  relies on time-points as the elementary primitives time-points are seen as symbolic variables on which temporal constraints can be posted we handle both sym bohc constraints  precedence  simultaneity  and numeric constraints expressed as bounded intervals  i~ i+  on the temporal distance between time-points disjunctions of these constraints are not directly handled by the time-map manager but through the control module the time map manager propagates constraints to ensure the global consistency of the network and answers queries about the relative position of time-points 
　a variable constraint manager handles atemporal variables ranging over finite bets and propagates domain restriction  equality  and unequality constraints1 
1 	description of world and change 
the world state is described through a set of multi-valued state attributes a state attribute is a k-ary state variable which can take only one value at a time 
   actually  as propagating variable uneqnakties is an untractable problem in itself  we jstt work out a local consistency for this type of constraints 
1 	planning 
　ixtet is based on a reified logic formalism where state attributes are temporally qualified by the predicates hold and event 
  an assertion hold att xi    v  ti t1   asserts the persistence of the value of attribute att xit   to v for each t tl   t   i1 assertions allow the expression of operator conditions as well as of causal hnks 
  event att xi    {vi vj  t  states that an instantaneous change of value of att x     from vl to v1 occured at time t events allow the description of state change in operators as well as of expected changes of the world in the initial problem description 
1 	description of resource uses 
we define a resource as any substance or set of objects whose cost or availability induces constraints on the actions that use them 
　a resource can be a single item with a unit capacity  an unsharable resource   or an aggregate resource that can be shared simultaneously between different actions seeing that its maximal capacity is not exceeded resources are gathered together into resource types two resources belong to the same type if they can be indifferently used 
　the resource availability profiles and their uses by different operators are described b  means of three predicates 
  use{typ{r  ffr  *i *a   means that an integer quantity q of resource r of type typ will be used between time-points t  and ty notice it is just a borrowing of a part of the resource  
  con1ume typ r  g t  states that a quantity y of resource r will be consumed at time t  l e that the availability of r will decrease at t 
  produce iyp{r  q t  represents a production of resource at time t 
　this paper focuses on the management of sharable re sources  i e whose capacity exceed 1  as these resources are often equivalent resources for which we don't need to explicitly manage a final allocation  we first make the hypothesis that all the resources of a given type are completely aggregated so that the only information binded to a resource type is its maximal capacity furthermore  we will only consider the borrowing of resources  predicate use  we will extend these hypotheses at the end of the paper 
1 	planning operators 
planning operators are described through a hierarchy of tasks a task is a temporal structure composed of 
  a set of sub-tasks  
  a set of events describing the changes of the world induced by the task  
  a set of assertions on state attributes to express the required conditions or some causal links between task events  
  a set of resource uses  and 


laborie and ghallab 

resolvers that will constitute a homogeneous representation where the control module chooses a flaw independently of its bejng a resource conflict  a threat or a pending subgoal this idea meets the one developed in watplan  yang  1  where the flaw/resolver representation is seen as a constraint satisfaction problem  csp   tsang  1  whose variables are represented by flaws  and their possible values by resolvers 
1 	c h o o s i n g a resolver to solve a flaw 
in ixtet  the explicit representation of temporal metric constraints and finite domain variables permits an estimation of the commitment induced by a constraint 
posting 
　indeed  as a partial plan v represents a set of possible instantiations inst v   we estimate the commitment of posting a constraint p on v as 
that Φ is a deterministic flaw as it does not complicate the search tree function k permits to solve in priority those flaws with the smallest number of resolvers  this being modulated by the value of resolvers commitment 
1 	search tree e x p l o r a t i o n 
the search is controlled by a near-admissible at algonthm  ghallab and auard  1  which provides a tradeoff between the efficiency of the search and the quality of the solution in terms of flexibility the estimate / of a partial plan v at a given node is a combination of g  the commitment along the path leading from pmit to v  and h  a combination of the minimal commitment for each remaining flaw Φ in v assuming that each remaining flaw in v can be independently solved bj its least-commitment resolver  / is inversely proportional to the maximal flexibility1 of solution plans contained in v

we have about 1 to 1 resource propositions of a given type  size is in the order of 1 
1 	scheduling problems 
to compare it to other schedulers  our approach has been tested on some pure scheduling problems  such as the scheduling of equipment compartments integration for the anane 1 rocket launcher thib problem uses 1 sharable resource types  mainly  skilled manpower and test systems  for a total of about 1 resource propo-
sitions because of operations earliest start times and latest completion time  the problem is globally very constrained ixtet finds a solution in about 1s without backtracking  this time should  for example  be compared to the 1 or 1 mn required by micro-boss  sadeh  1  to solve problems of the same size

               figure 1 a solution plan sources the horizontal axis refers to the time points in the plan  linearised only for the purpose of an easy display of barcharts the actual precedence constraints of the solution plan are given in the ixtet plan lattice it should be noticed how our least-commitment approach leads to a highly parallel and flexible solution plan as we try to never over-constrain it 
　the ixtet planner has been tested on many planning problems involving resources  house building  room finishing problem  task-level control for a team of 1 mobile robots  etc   whose generated solution plan contains between 1 to 1 tasks and requires less than 1mn of running time for example  planning for a planetary exploration of mars with 1 rovers requires about lmn of running time for a three day long plan involving more than 1 tasks  1 temporal propositions and 1 time-points the plan was generated while taking into account visibility windows between the rovers and an orbiter  sun-light  communication channels and energy constraints the problem was initially stated as a set of data concerning the planet that were to be received by the orbiter within 1 days 
1 	applicability domains 
many fields may be interested in such an integrated approach of plan generation and resource management 
they can be classified according to their needs in terms of plan generation our approach allows for a great flexibility to express implicit conditions and effects of operations instead of explicit and hard-coded precedence constraints between them as it is traditionally done to describe problems in factory production or project man agement furthermore  domains as spatial station operations planning or management of test systems need  in addition of resource management  facilities to generate 

reconfiguration operations of some sub-ays terns that depend on their last state these operations  because of their duration or because of their use of resources for themselves  may affect the resource management process finally  activities like autonomous robots planning  where plan generation play a major part must take resources into account to produce robust plans 
　our approach has been highly motivated by a preanalysis of these various domains 
1 	conclusion and future work 
lxtet  is a temporal planner that integrates sharable resource management into the plan generation process this paper shows how this integration is achieved through the crossing of various techniques and ideas from classical planning  scheduling  graph theory and constraint satisfaction problems 
　the performances of the resource analysis module allows ixtet to tackle realistic problems involving sharable resources while the underlying algorithmic ensures the completeness of the search 
　future work will mainly consist in improving the expressiveness of the planner we have already integrated producible and consumable resources in the same way that consumption of resources can easily be seen as a borrowing over a temporal half-line  t  +oo   we consider the production of resource as an atemporal increase of the resource capacity combined with a borrowing of the resource over   - oo t  this allows to manage producible resources with the possibility of automatically inserting resource production tasks without modifying our mcs detection procedure
