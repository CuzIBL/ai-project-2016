         research1 on mycin-like1 consultation systems indicates that a rule-based system achieves better performance if guided by models of  typical  consultation situations. one very powerful form of reasoning used by a human consultant when he is presented with a new situation is that of classifying and comparing the new situation with situations he has encountered previously. for example  an auto mechanic who is asked to fix a car which won't start w i l l check the starter  the battery  and the supply of gas because he is guided by his model of a  car won't start  situation  and tnus has expectations about the cause of the problem. the auto mechanic is also able to check the consistency of his information precisely because he has a model of the typical findings for this situation. 
         similarly  in our consultation system  we use models of typical consultation situations to guide the invocation of our rules  and to check for inconsistent information. our models are frame-like1 structures containing both modelindependent pieces of information called elements  such as a name and a certainty measure  and modelspecific pieces of information called the components of the model. for example  the components in a model of acute cystitis include the age  sex and therapy for the typical acute c y s t i t i s patient. 
         inability to f i t information into one or more of these models may indicate that there are inconsistencies. for example  finding sickle-cell anemia in a caucasion patient is not consistent. it may also indicate that the structure of the model is incomplete  for instance  that a component is missing  or that this is an atypical situation that is not represented in any model. 
         there exists a hierarchy of models  beginning at the top with a model of a general

         at any moment  there is one model which represents the system's current hypothesis about how to classify the given information. attempting to f i l l in the components of this model may in turn cause rules to be executed or questions to be asked of the user. therefore  rules are executed and questions are asked for the purpose of verifying this current hypothesis. in the system without models  rules are executed to establish a general goal  such as   determine if the patient has disease   which may cause irrelevant rules to be t r i e d . the search for information in a modelbased system is thus more directed and faster because irrelevant questions and needless rule invocations are minimized. 
         models also allow an improved explanation f a c i l i t y because we can say what the currenthypothesis i s   that i s   which model is being t r i e d . at present  the explanation f a c i l i t y can only state which rule is being executed  which rule was executed before i t   etc.  in a process of  unwinding  the rules which were used in making decisions. in the model-based system  rule invocations occur in the context of a model so that a  higher-level   contextual explanation can be given about why these rules are being t r i e d . 
         the u1e of models gives us further capabilities  such as the a b i l i t y to generate patient summaries  which have been d i f f i c u l t to achieve previously because this contextual information was not available. in addition  models can be updated or added to the system wi th relative ea1e  allowing us to accomodate a large and changing body of technical knowledge. thus we feel that the adaptation of the current rule-based formalism to include models results in a substantially improved and very powerful consultation system.
