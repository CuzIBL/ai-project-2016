　　　our' goal is the development and application of various techniques for generating approximate responses to data base queries. an  approximate response  is a response other than a direct answer to the question. approximate responses are frequently referred to by linguists as  indirect answers  or  replies   e.g. in bs1 . what is approximate is not so much the response as the relationship between the response and the i n i t i a l query. our approach is to regard an interaction between a user and a data base as a discourse  having the properties and constraints normally associated with human dialog.  conversational postulates of grice  g1  are examples of such constraints.  many of the conventions of human dialog can be implemented through approximate responses which  for instance  1  aid a user in formulating a suitable alternative query when the precise response to the i n i t i a l query would be uninteresting or useless; 1  inform a user about the structure or content of the data base when the user is unfamiliar with i t s complexities; and 1  summarize at an appropriate level  eliminating unnecessary detail. 
　　　natural language  nl  query systems are of benefit to users who are only partially familiar with the structure and/or content of the underlying data base. such  naive  users are typically hampered by their lack of knowledge in formulating a query which w i l l retrieve the. desired information. we believe that nl can do more than simply provide the user with a convenient  higher-level replacement for a formalized query syntax. nl questions frequently embed information about the user's understanding of the structure of the data. this information can be exploited to inform and guide the user in the use of the data base. 
　　　of particular interest to us is the key role that shared knowledge between conversants plays in the effectiveness of human dialog. 	as observed in  ch1   dialog tends to proceed with statements which offer a specific piece of 'new' information to the conversation which is differentiated from information considered as 'given' or already known

to the other party. breaches of this 'given-new contract' can point to the need for additional background information to be supplied in order for communication to be effective. we believe that this observation can be effectively utilized within the context of queries to a data base system. our approach here is to pay special attention to the 'given' information contained in the user's questions in the form of presuppositions. if these turn out to be false  we interpret this as a signal that the user misunderstands some aspect of the data base's structure or content and is in need of additional c l a r i f i c a t i o n . an approximate response e x p l i c i t l y contradicting the failed presupposition and perhaps suggesting an alternative is appropriate  as it is in human dialog. such a response serves to correct the users mis impressions and provide suggestions for alternatives  hopefully relevant and useful ones. 
　　　a presupposition of a sentence s can be broadly defined as any assertion that must be true in order for s to be meaningful. 	in the case of questions  the presupposition must be true for a direct answer to be meaningful. 
　　　presuppositions come in many forms. there are presuppositions which are primarily syntactic  jw1 . others deal with implied restrictions on the size  or a claim about the completeness of the answer set  bs1 . of particular interest in a 
　　　data base context are those presuppositions of an nl question which are implied by a corresponding formal query to a given data-base structure. we have observed that each stage in the execution of a formal query  except for the final one  has an interpretation as a presupposition of the nl question. if a particular stage of execution returns a null set  the corresponding presupposition has failed and can be explicitly contradicted  rather than returning an obviously uninformative or misleading null response. 
consider the query 
 which linguistics majors got a grade of b or 
better in cs1   
assuming a suitable structure for the data 
　 see figure one   a corresponding formal query might perform the following operations: 1  find the set of students and restrict it to linguistics majors; 1  find the set of courses and restrict it to cs1; 1  find the class l i s t  set of students  associated with the result of 1; m  restrict the class l i s t of 1 to those with grades   b; and 1  intersect 1 with 1 to produce the response. an empty set at each stage could be used to produce the following approximate responses contradicting the failed presuppositions: 1  there are no linguistics majors; 1  there is no course  cs1 ; 1  no students were enrolled in cs1; and 1  no students received a grade of b or better in cs1. a failure in the final stage leads to the direct answer none. it is worth noting that different data structures w i l l reveal different presuppositions. for instance  a different data base might produce the response  no linguistics majors took cs1.

     another type of approximate response deals w i t h the generation of a response to a s u b s t i t u t e query. for i n s t a n c e     i s venus the f o u r t h p l a n e t     may be responded to by   n o   it is the second 
p l a n e t .     s e e  l1  f o r s i m i l a r examples . 	a de-
t e r m i n a t i o n of t h e focus and t o p i c of the question can be used to generate an appropriate a l t e r n a t i v e   as opposed to  say    n o   mars is the f o u r t h p l a n e t .   s y n t a c t i c and c o n t e x t u a l cues are 
under i n v e s t i g a t i o n to determine the t o p i c and focus i n t h e face o f p a r t i a l i n f o r m a t i o n . 	careful c o n s t r u c t i o n of the formal query can provide a r e l e v a n t piece o f a l t e r n a t i v e i n f o r m a t i o n f o r f r e e by s e l e c t i n g the most appropriate access path to the d e s i r e d i n f o r m a t i o n . 
     an important convention of human conversation is t h a t no p a r t i c i p a n t monopolize the d i s c o u r s e   so t h a t c o n t r o l can be shared. one i m p l i c a t i o n of t h i s i s t h a t a l l responses given i n a convers a t i o n a l mode must be s h o r t . thus where the system 
would otherwise respond w i t h a lengthy l i s t   we would p r e f e r to be able to r e t u r n a non-enumerat i v e   or   i n t e n s i o n a l   response . lengthy response sets could be summarized  or defined by a charact e r i s t i c o r a t t r i b u t e . for i n s t a n c e   the question  which employees engage in p r o f i t sharing   may be answered by l i s t i n g the extension of a set c o n t a i n i n g  perhaps  1 names  or by the i n t e n s i o n a l response   a l l v i c e - p r e s i d e n t s .   the summary might be computed from the data or i n f e r e d from the data base schema  and can be used to avoid unnecessary and d i s t r a c t i n g d e t a i l . i n these cases  the response may i m p l i c i t l y i n c o r p o r a t e the r e s t r i c t i o n s of the q u e s t i o n . for i n s t a n c e   a response to  which students were i n v i t e d t o the p a r t y     o f  the g i r l s l i v i n g i n west p h i l a d e l p h i a .   c l e a r l y i m p l i e s t h a t o n l y those g i r l s who are students were i n v i t e d  kh 1 . answers  which i n h i b i t e d browsing and query f o r m u l a t i o n   approximate responses  as they are used in human d i a l o g   can s i g n i f i c a n t l y increase the usefulness and convenience of data base query systems.
