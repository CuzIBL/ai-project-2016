d i f f i c u l t y encountered l i e s in the development of the algorithm  not in the syntax or semantics of the language. the contribution gained by the use of flowcharts has been negligible; the major c o n t r i b u t i o n came from allowing the students to work in groups. 
　　　　　the essay follows the argument that  accepting the premise that programming requires l o g i c a l t h i n k i n g   a solution to t h i s problem may be forthcoming if it is tackled by helping these students to develop problem solving s k i l l s from an early age; thereby placing the onus on the schoolteacher. 
         use of educational tools  namely bigtrak  i n i t i a l l y for the very young  followed by the turtle with l o g o programming  and l a t t e r l y microprolog is advocated. 
         the 	paper 	is 	introduced 	by 	a 	brief discourse on the concept of knowledge  in order to confirm that to teach thinking is 	d i f f i c u l t   	and hence t h a t there is a r o l e f o r some aspect of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence in the classroom. 
　　　by d e f i n i t i o n   a teacher's role in the classroom must be that of one who teaches  imparting knowledge and guiding the studies of the pupils. but  the concept of knowledge is d i f f i c u l t to define and cannot be determined precisely in the way that some words can. in attempting to define the constituents of the concept of knowledge  various notions can be considered  for example: information  instruction  enlightenment  learning  or practical s k i l l s . 
　　attempts have been made to break knowledge into divisions  hirst  1  put forward the suggestion that knowledge was separable into d i s t i n c t forms  such as mathematics  physical sciences etc. but  if these forms are accepted then the concept of a particular branch of

 knowledge m a y even d i f f e r   depending on how it is presented. polya  1  states   mathematics presented in the euclidean way appears as a systematic deductive science  but mathematics in the making appears as an experimental inductive science.  
     the view that the four ways of thought: l o g i c a l   empirical  moral  and aesthetic represent more fundamental divisions of knowledge  
philips  1  perhaps relates more closely to the aim of including more of the cognitive aspects of teaching in the classroom. 
     while the claim that knowledge is worthwhile on i t s own account  simply for the development of the mind  can be appreciated  as cribble  1  argues  forms of d r i l l are not i n t r i n s i c a l l y worthwhile. and while this form of teaching perhaps cannot entirely be dispensed with  the question often arises r e l a t i n g to whether teachers actually teach children to think  i . e . to develop their a b i l i t y for reasoning  experimenting  making moral r e f l e c t i o n   or to achieve an appreciation of aesthetic principles. the knowledge that is planted in a child has to be brought into action. 
     landa  1  considers t h a t some teachers do teach c h i l d r e n to t h i n k but t h a t some do n o t . he admits that to teach thinking is a problem  because the operations that have to be carried out on the knowledge present in the student's head  in order to be able to problem solve are not well developed. 
　　the 	assertion 	that organised teaching is not required for learning to take place  	is 	held 	by papert  1   who puts forward the analogy of how a child learns to t a l k . 
     the d i f f i c u l t y of teaching children to think then is evident  and while the computer can be a catalysing agent for promoting a d i f f e r e n t type of teaching to take place in the classroom  to-date the methods employed in computer-aided-learning  have on the whole  contributed l i t t l e to further the pursuit to help children to think. computer-aided learning techniques employed in schools generally follow the t r a d i t i o n a l method of classroom teaching  and if a c h i l d ' s development p a r t i a l l y depends on t h i s t r a d i t i o n a l approach to teaching  then present computer-aided-learning does seem to provide motivation and have a novelty value  a l b e i t   possibly a temporary innovation.

but paperfs  1  association of t h i s use of a computer for d r i l l and practice  combined with the use of the basic language   with that of the q w e r t y keyboard  exemplifies the dangers imminent when t r a d i t i o n takes a firm hold  and the ensuing d i f f i c u l t y encountered when endeavouring to bring about any change; in this case in the way that computers are used in the classroom. 
     i n t e l l i g e n t tutoring systems cater for the student more adequately  and aid research into learning  but are rarely found in schools. also 
a r t i f i c i a l intelligence programs which deal with aspects of human behaviour designed to simulate behaviour help to i l l u m i n a t e how c h i l d r e n t h i n k . 
     in the classroom  a simple machine in the form of a toy tank  bigtrak  can be used by primary and infant teachers for mathematics teaching and to involve the children in logical thinking  besides providing an introduction to computer techniques. the tank can be programmed to move  turn  pause or f i r e and the children can think of their own problems and also how to solve them  and hence program the tank. they often act as bigtrak themselves in finding out the required movements  then l o g i c a l l y assemble them to produce the program of instructions  which importantly  they realise may not be correct at the f i r s t t r i a l . 
hence  this toy enables a means of pupil-controlled investigation to take place  besides providing a by-product of introducing measurement and direction to them. the guidance of the teacher is required  as without this i t s value would diminish. 
     bigtrak then forms a medium for papert's ideas  1  although a rather unrefined tool in some respects  learning is achieved through i t s use without formal teaching  and i t s advantage in schools l i e s in i t s comparative cheapness. 
     the object that papert 1  advocates for use with children  the turtle  has a cost disadvantage at present  but with the i n f i l t r a t i o n of the microcomputer in a l l schools in b r i t a i n   the concept of i t   as an educational tool in the classroom  is rapidly gaining acceptance  even though many schools have to be content with   t u r t l e   graphics on the screen  and it is expected that the cost w i l l be lowered. but  even with   t u r t l e   graphics  the child is in control and observations show that they usually enact the steps required to solve their particular problem. 
     the program language incorporating the use of the turtle  l o g o   evolved f o r a p p l i c a t i o n s by children by feurzeig et al. 1 . the f u l l version of l o g o provides additional f a c i l i t i e s to the usual high level language  for example  l i s t processing and recursive functions. but  in many schools in b r i t a i n only a subset of the language is in use which relate only to controlling the screen   t u r t l e   . this reduces the amount of storage required and the cost of the software. programs are also written in basic which can provide a reasonably successful l o g o environment in the classroom. 
     while many school teachers in b r i t a i n are just beginning to be introduced to the potential of the use of l o g o as an educational t o o l   possibly because it was devised for such a purpose  a reasonable amount of research and evaluation has been carried out. 
     preliminary observations in primary schools in bedfordshire have revealed keen interest by both teachers and children in i t s use. the teachers have been impressed by the strategic s k i l l s shown by many of t h e i r p u p i l s .

mathematics through l o g o programming  howe et a l . 
1   the conclusion reached is that the understanding of mathematics by children who are less able can be improved by such programming-based a c t i v i t i e s . 
     an i n v e s t i g a t i o n i n t o the claims made f o r the use of the turtle in the classroom  i n v o l v i n g 1 special schools situated over a wide area of england and wales terminates in july 1. the research is co-ordinated by the chiltern advisory unit  hatfield  england; the f i n a l evaluation report should help teachers in deciding the c o n t r i b u t i o n that the turtle can make to the development of children. 
     while it has been shown that g i r l s generally do not achieve as high results as boys in computer studies  the opinion is emerging that they do marginally better than the boys when l o g o is used. 
     but  it is not only children who can benefit from u s i n g l o g o   du boulay  1  showed t h a t student teachers who experienced d i f f i c u l t y with certain areas in mathematics gained a better understanding by w r i t i n g l o g o programs to investigate the topics. 
     l o g o is used in b r i t i s h and american schools and developments in france  to ascertain i t s potential for use as an i n t r i n s i c part of their educational system  are taking place. 
　　　prolog-programming in logic  designed by colmerauer and colleagues in 1  images human reasoning and u t i l i s e s natural language. papert enthusiasts support the use of p r o l o g for children; a close relationship exists between l o g o and p r o l o g . 
　　　p r o l o g is now being made available f o r microcomputer systems in the form of microprolog  developed by mc cabe 1. relatively l i t t l e work has been carried out on i t s use in the classroom  but  a project has been running since october 1   logic as a computer language for children   based at imperial college  london. evaluation is being conducted in a number of schools and colleges  and courses are being held for teachers in various parts of england. 
　　this project is led by robert kowalski who considers that microprolog contributes to promoting logical thinking for use throughout the 

school curriculum and that it can stand as a subject on i t s own. he considers that because it is not tied to a particular machine structure  it. is more suitable for use by children than languages which are. ennels 1 . 
     ennels  1  has expressed surprise at the quickness that children are learning microprolog. the pupils build their own database and formulate queries  so promoting clear thinking and expresssion. 
     these then are some of the t o o l s that can be used in assisting teachers to teach children to t h i n k ; many other micro-technology aids are available and although many are considered to be simply computer toys  an investigation into their p o t e n t i a l use in the classroom m a y reveal t h a t some are more than t o y s .  computer toys come closer to imitating the style of human intelligence than the teaching machines of the past and may w e l l represent the educational wave of the f u t u r e .    gardner 1 . 
     in conclusion  the educational tools suggested for use in this paper are mainly just being introduced to schools in the bedfordshire area  hence it w i l l be some time before there can be any evidence to show that the children's capacity for clear thinking has improved and as a result the d i f f i c u l t i e s experienced by the ones who may eventually wish to include further computer programming as part  of t h e i r f u t u r e studies m a y be lessened. current research in this area suggests that t h i s w i l l be so.
