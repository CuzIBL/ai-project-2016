this note very b r i e f l y describes a data base system with provision for natural language input. no attempt is made here to j u s t i f y the strategies adopted. those interested in j u s t i f i c a t i o n are referred to   d e l l   1 r c o / king  spadavecchia 1 . 
　　　the system has been deliberately designed to be very modular. the data base i t s e l f is a relational model based on codd  codd 1 .two sample data bases are considered in the present system prototype: the f i r s t is about energetic resources and the second is about a department store. this last contains information about items sold and supplied  
employees  departments etc... detai 1 s in  chamberlin 1     . the data base is interrogated by means of a formal query language  aql  which is interpreted into a 
set of apl procedures. a user experienced in computer usage would be able to use aql d i r e c t l y if he chose  thus avoiding natural language input and economising on processing time. aql and the data base implementation form two of the main modules of the system. details of aql  of i t s implementation and of that of the data base management system can be found in  antonacci del 1 'oreo  spadavecchia 1 . 
　　　obviously the most interesting feature of the system from an al view point is the natural language input. a c r i t i c a l theorical decision has been made here. it is by now generally agreed that any adeguate natural language processing system must make use of general world knowledge. in a data base system the world knowledge involved seems to us to break down into two parts: the general knowledge of the world encapusulated in language use  and the much more r e s t r i c t e d knowledge of the data base world. thus words and phrases quite legitemately used in the natural language formulation of a question in a certain sense may have no meaning within the data base world. 
before such a meaning can be a t t r i b u t e d to them a correspondence must be set up between them and the formal objects of the data base. 
         in order to accomplish this two semantlcally driven modules deal with natural language analysis. the f i r s t is a 
         general natural language analyser intended to allow as wide a subset of natural language as possible. it is independent 
of any particular data base  being based on the semantic structures of the natural language. this module is a development of 
a part of wilks* preference semantics system  wilks 1   and establishes an intermediate semantic representation very similar to that used by wilks as input to the generation section of his system  see herskowitz 1 . however  some d i f f i c u l t i e s of reference and of disambiguation which  for wilks  would be resolved by common sense inference rules  remain in our representation to be dealt with by the next module. this intermediate representation serves as input to the second semantlcally driven component. but now the semantics involved is the semantics of the data base  not the semantics of the natural language. 
natural 	language-1: dell'oreo 1        connections between the elements of the intermediate representation and the names of relations and domains of the data base are established. for example  in a question about departments which sell shoes  the word  shoe  has attached an information specifying that it is an item which can be sold or supplied. the verb  to s e l l     connected to  shoe   helps to choose the right data base reference for  shoe . a transformation algorithm then recodes the question in terms of the formal query language mentioned e a r l i e r . thus  when the data base is changed  unless the vocabulary dealt with by the f i r s t semantic module needs to be enlarged  a l l that needs to be changed are the connections between the elements of the natural language and the data base.
