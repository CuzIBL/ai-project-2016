	1. 	introduction 
　　　lnduction may be broadly defined as  reasoning from a part to a whole  from p a r t i c u l a r s to generals  or from the individual to the u n i v e r s a l   . consistent with t h i s   we view  induction  as a computational process  and a  generalization  as a statement computed by that process. 
　　　the present work is guided by the b e l i e f that general purpose induction procedures can be formulated which would be independent of the a r t i f i c i a l intelligence problem domain. it is specif i c a l l y concerned with the induction of concepts from positive and negative instances described in the predicate calculus  with terms limited to constants and universally quantified variables. 
　　　inductive processes i n a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i gence have been studied from several aspects: visual analogies   1     propositional logic concept learning   1   1     analogies in predicate calculus theorem proving   s     iq test completion problems   1     theory formation from a data base   1     visual concept learning from examples   1     and induction as a dual of deductive theorem proving in the predicate calculus   1   1   1     or in a generalizittion of the predicate calculus   1   . the present work may be regarded as a continuance of the concept learning research of hunt and towster  amongs others  to the predicate calculus. i t s viewpoint and many of the concepts are derived from p l o t k i n . 
　　　throughout  each positive and negative i n stance of a concept is assumed to be described by a conjunction of l i t e r a l s in the predicate calculus  not necessarily f i r s t order . section 1 defines terminology to be employed  of which the most s i g n i f i c a n t is the concept of a  maximal  consistent  unifying generalization   and contains some general observations on generalizations. with this background  a problem statement is then given in the defined vocabulary. section 1 introduces the  product graph   a graph representation of a conjunction of l i t e r a l s   which serves as a convenient medium for the discussion of the induction process. this process is accomplished by straightforward operations on these product graphs. section 1 considers the application of product graphs to the question of the  consistency  of a generalization in view of negative i n stances. section 1 contains concluding remarks.

problem: 	given a concept d e f i n i t i o n in extension  as in  1   how can consistent  unifying generalizations of the p o s i t i v e products be computed in order to simplify the defi n i t i o n   
it is to this specific problem that the following discussions are addressed. 
	1. 	the product graph as an induction medium 
　　　in t h i s section an induction procedure is formulated with respect to a graph representation of products  called a  product graph . unlike some e a r l i e r graph representations of r e l a t i o n a l i n f o r mation  the product graph is not l i m i t e d to binary relations. it represents l i t e r a l s of a r b i t r a r y dimension in a uniform manner. the overall effect of the induction procedure is to merge pairs of positive products. it may be i t e r a t i v e l y applied tint i 1 a l l posi t i ve products have been merged  or u n t i l no maximal consistent generalizations exist for any pair of products. this procedure is precisely described and i t s correctness is proven. 
　　　the product graph representation has properties that make it useful as an induction medium. if a product p1 is a generalization of another product p1  the product graph of p1 is isomorphic to a subgraph of the product graph of p1. a  greatest common subgraph  of two product graphs is the graph of a maximal unifying generalization of those two products. thus the problem of computing maximal unifying generalizations is transformed to the computation of maximal isomorphic subgraphs. 

　　　each l i t e r a l in a product w i l l be represented by a unique node in l. each d i s t i n c t constant appearing in a product w i l l be represented by a unique element of c. variables appearing in a pro duct w i l l have no e x p l i c i t representation. recall that the variables are universally quantified and thus are dummy variables: their names have no significance. the l i t e r a l dimension function   specifies the number of terms in each l i t e r a l . for example  if λ1 =  a b c     1 a  = 1. the l i t eral sign function o serves to distinguish posit i v e and negative l i t e r a l s . for example  with a. 

　　　　these adjacency relations are the arcs between l i t e r a l nodes in the product graph. in an obvious way  these arcs can p a r t i t i o n the l i t e r a l nodes into d i s j o i n t blocks  with the nodes in each block forming a connected subgraph of the complete product graph. these connected subgraphs w i l l be important in the concept of a  vacuous  generali z a t i o n   which is discussed in subsection 1. 
1 	product graph example 
　　　as an example  figure 1 shows the product graph for the product with the individual l i t e r a l s i d e n t i f i e d by and  respectively. constant nodes are shown as squares; l i t e r a l nodes are shown as c i r c l e s . this example i n c i d e n t a l l y demonstrates that an adjacency r e l a t i o n due to a common constant in two l i t erals is redundant information  which could be derived from the content function information. this mild and occasional redundancy contributes to the desirable properties of product graphs which are next discussed.

in other words  consistency of a generalization can be determined by verifying that its product graph is not isomorphic to a subgraph of any negative product. 
　　　the following lemma and theorem demonstrate the significance of maximal generalizations in determining the existence of any consistent gener 

　　　a precise yet mathematically parsimonious induction procedure has been described for concepts in the predicate calculus. the product graph representation accommodates literals having an arbitrary number of terms. the computation of generalizations and the testing of their consistency has been achieved by comparison operations on these product graphs. the information supplied by negative instances of a concept determines if a generalization is consistent  and may serve to select between a number of distinct maximal generalizations. if all maximal generalizations are inconsistent  it has been shown that no consistent generalization exists. if a maximal generalization is consistent  it may then be generalized further  holding short of the point where it would  cover  a negative product. a sn1l1 program has been written which implements and confirms the methods of this paper. exploration of its capab i l i t i e s is in progress. 
　　　because a generalization replaces just two products  and a number of distinct maximal generalizations may exist  there remains the question of strategies in the application of the induction procedure in an iterative manner to a large number of positive products.

　　　worthwhile departures from present theory would include concepts which are iterative orpotent i a l l y i n f i n i t e   such as the sequence abbecedddd. ..  as well as hierarchial and recursive concepts  a l l of which seem essential to human perception and thought.
