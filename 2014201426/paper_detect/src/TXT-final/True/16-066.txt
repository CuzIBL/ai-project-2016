 
　　　a modified version of phr~- resolution comprising negative hyper-resolution and paramodulation is introduced to reduce the search of statements that contain t r a n s i t i v e r e l a t i o n s . 
　　　let r be a symbol of t r a n s i t i v e r e l a t i o n and l e t a nucleus contain the l i t e r a l trp  and l e t a factor of an electron be of the form c v nt rt1.moreover l e t us suppose that tu = t   u   where u is a simultaneous most general u n i f i e r for the corresponding clash. then the resolvent of t h i s clash contains the subclause  c v prt1 u. this rule of deduction is said to be tphr - r u l e . 
　　　it is shown that tphr - r e s o l u t i o n is complete. more precisely  it is shown that the empty clause a can be deduced from a set g of clauses which contains the axiom of t r a n s i t i v i t y tr for the r e l a t i o n r by using phr  - resolution i f f can be deduced from the set g - { t r }by using tphr - r e s o l u t i o n . 
　　　the e f f i c i e n c y of the use of tphr~rule is i l l u s t r a t e d by examples. 
　　　the p o s s i b i l i t y for the strategy of p o s i t i v e hyper-resolution was shown in 
l 1  to reduce the search to some extent. some further ideas on t h i s subject can be found in cl  . in the present paper we show how to avoid the e x p l i c i t use of trans i t i v i t y axiom w i t h i n the strategy of negative hyper-resolution. this strategy is chosen because it can be combined with paramodulation as it is shown in c1  and because each d e r i v a t i o n of the empty clause can be easily transformed i n t o d i r e c t proof of the statement in question by using negative hyper-resolution   c f . . 
　　　recall that under negative hyperr e s o l u t i o n strategy we divide the set of a l l clauses i n t o two p a r t s : clauses of nucleus   which contain one or more posi t i v e l i t e r a l s   and electrons  which 
consist of only negative l i t e r a l s   . resolvents are always electrons. 
　　　the idea developed below is as f o l lows. let some electron clause c contain l i t e r a l t1 rt1 this means that statement t1rt1 should be proved. if a nucleus contains a p o s i t i v e l i t e r a l of the form t1. rt' and u is the most general u n i f i e r or the terms t1  and t' then the statement   t ' r t 1   u might be proved instead of the o r i g i n a l one. now we formally develop a l l the constructions necessary. 
1. tphr  - rule 
　　　f i r s t we formulate the so c a l l e d phrr u l e of r e s o l u t i o n type which comprises both negative hyper-resolution and paramodulation. as usually  negative clauses are electrons  a l l the r e s t are nucleus. factorization is allowed only for the electrons.

note that due to unforeseen circumstances nucleus 1 	did not participate in the deduction. 
　　　l i t e r a l l s s  a e  is present in a l l clauses  but resolution with nucleus 1 eliminates i t . so having obtained r e solvent   t s s   a   e   } the proof seeking process is considered to be successfully terminated. 
　　　note that clause 1 is subsumed by clause 1 . 
　　　having noticed that no further poss i b i l i t i e s for resolution are available nucleus 1 was called into the process and the deduction went on. namely  the number of resolvents of level n+1 was of n! the empty clause d was obtained at the eighth l e v e l . 
　　　yet if we go on with the deduction by using tphr-rule we obtain the resolvents presented in table l a   which is the continuation of table 1.
