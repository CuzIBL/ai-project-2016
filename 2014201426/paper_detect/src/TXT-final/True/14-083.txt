i introduction 
       signed binary trees have been introduced in  in order to solve equations which have no solution in binary trees. such equations appear in 
program synthesis or transformation processes. this technique enables us to perform such synthesis or transformation processes in various situations. our goal here is to study how equations may be solved in this theory. 
       section ii recalls both usual concepts of un i f i c a t i o n in an equational theory and d e f i n i t i o n s of signed binary trees considered as terms of an equational theory or as a term rewriting system. 
       section i i i introduces the concept of equivalent equations and sets some basic tools used in the following sections. 
　　　　section iv describes and proves an algorithm which transforms an equation into an equivalent one  with less function symbols . some properties of reduced equations are studied. 
       section v is concerned with the resolution of linear equation  an equation is linear if there 
exists a variable x which has a unique occurrence in the terms of the equivalent reduced equation . we give a constructive caracterisation of the most general solution  up to an isomorphism  of such a linear equation. 
       the matching problem is then studied in section v i . 
　　　an example of application to program derecursivation is shown in section v i i .
