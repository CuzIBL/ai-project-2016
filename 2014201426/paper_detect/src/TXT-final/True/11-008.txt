we describe some f e a t u r e s of a program which i n t e r p r e t s cartoons which are two-dimensional r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s of events in the three-dimensional w o r l d . the main problems c o n f r o n t i n g the r e c o g n i t i o n procedures stem from the d i f f i c u l t i e s i n d e s c r i b i n g the i r r e g u l a r ourved l i n e drawings 
which comprise t h i s domain: 
1  shane d e s c r i p t i o n s curved o b j e c t s are more d i f f i c u l t to describe than polyhedra. the d i f f i c u l t y is compounded when curved o b j e c t s are a l s o i r r e g u l a r   and vary each time they are hand-drawn. 
1  occlusion hidden contours cannot be found by boundary extension f o r the i r r e g u l a r curved c a r t o o n w o r l d . 
the s t r a t e g y we adopt  based on ideas of guzman   is to reduce the importance of precise shape d e s c r i p t i o n s by e x p l o i t i n g context informaion provided by the use of models. 
models 
i n d i v i d u a l components of our simple scenes are l o c a l l y ambiguous because each shape can have several p o s s i b l e r e f e r e n t s   e . g . a rectangular r e g i o n may be part of a l e g   a sock  or a baseball b a t   e t c . models are proposed on r a t h e r gross f e a t u r e s and once invoked provide context i n f o r m a t i o n to determine the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n . the 
model h i e r a r c h y we employ has two main r o l e s : 
1  to provide shape i n f o r m a t i o n   i . e . a d e s c r i p t i o n o f the regions which occur i n the scene at a l o c a l l e v e l -- i t s appearance. 
1  to provide i n f o r m a t i o n about r e l a t i o n s h i p s between r e g i o n s . this is a more g l o b a l view. i t e x p l a i n s how small regions f i t together t o form l a r g e r   more meaningful s t r u c t u r e s . 
the r e l a t i o n a l   models of o b j e c t s in the peanuts w o r l d guide the a n a l y s i s by a p p l y i n g i n f o r m a t i o n about how regions may be connected to represent people and o b j e c t s . s o p h i s t i c a t e d techniques are a p p l i e d t o handle c o m p l i c a t i o n s a r i s i n g from o c c l u s i o n and v a r i a t i o n s in o r i e n t a t i o n . the shape models guide us in the matching of regions to shape d e s c r i p t i o n s . each shape model has an associated s e r i e s o f f e a t u r e t e s t s   v a r y i n g w i t h the complexity of the shape  which are a p p l i e d to the data d e f i n i n g the r e g i o n . guided by the r e l a t i o n a l c o n t e x t   the shape t e s t s o n l y need to v e r i f y the region i d e n t i t y r a t h e r than generate i t . 
the 	model 	i n f o r m a t i o n 	is 	s t r u c t u r e d 	i n t o 	a hierarchy 	based 	on f u n c t i o n a l groups of r e g i o n s . this deals w i t h s e l f - o c c l u s i o n 	as 	w e l l 	as 	w i t h o b j e c t s which have f l e x i b l e j o i n t s and may appear in various a t t i t u d e s . these s u b - s t r u c t u r e s are represented by a v a r i e t y of sub-models. each r e f l e c t s a p o s s i b l e r e g i o n c o n f i g u r a t i o n accounting f o r d i f f e r e n c e s among the characters and f o r the v a r i e t y of o r i e n t a t i o n s and body p o s i t i o n s . 
occlusion 
i n our cartoon domain  i t i s important t o discover which o b j e c t s are occluded since t h i s may a l t e r t h e i r perceived shape to the p o i n t where they can no longer be matched to a shape model. w i t h proof o f o c c l u s i o n   the system i s prepared t o lower i t s t h r e s h o l d f o r acceptance; otherwise  the c u r r e n t model must be r e j e c t e d in favour of a more a p p r o p r i a t e one  r e t a i n i n g p r e v i o u s l y computed i n f o r m a t i o n when p o s s i b l e . 
a t - j o i n t may be used as a powerful t o o l to c o n f i r m o c c l u s i o n . t - j o i n t s may be i n t e r p r e t e d as the place where an object s boundary disappears beneath another  or else where it reappears. the p a i r i n g h e u r i s t i c f i n d s the c o r r e c t p a i r o f such t - j o i n t s   thus p r o v i d i n g i n f o r m a t i o n about r e g i o n o c c l u s i o n . u n f o r t u n a t e l y   not a l l t - j o i n t s i n d i c a t e o c c l u s i o n ; they also may occur when one r e g i o n merely abuts another. the p a i r i n g h e u r i s t i c i s o n l y a p p l i e d when o c c l u s i o n i s the suspected cause of a region-to-model match f a i l u r e . i t can determine the proper p a i r i n g o f t - j o i n t s to any depth of o c c l u s i o n . the implemented system a l s o has the c a p a b i l i t y of d e a l i n g w i t h   c u r v e d   t - j o i n t s whose o r i e n t a t i o n may be ambiguous. 
experiments and extensions 
we have t e s t e d the r e l i a b i l i t y of the system by s y s t e m a t i c a l l y d i s t o r t i n g the presented data. by using drawings created by i n t e r p o l a t i o n between two c h a r a c t e r s   we have shown t h a t the shape models based on the presence of key f e a t u r e s can d i s t i n g u i s h between v a l i d r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s and  nonsense  scenes. by e n l a r g i n g the heel of a shoe in stages  we observed the strong context e f f e c t of the h i e r a r c h y t h a t forced acceptance of the d i s t o r t e d shape. further experiments have l e d to the refinement of the c o n t r o l s t r u c t u r e to use i n t e r m e d i a t e - l e v e l knowledge to overcome some problems of model i n s t a n t i a t i o n . this work is seen as the f i r s t stage of a m u l t i - s c e n e a n a l y s i s   using one scene to p r e d i c t the next.
