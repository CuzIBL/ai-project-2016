       if robots had the c a p a b i l i t y of supplying machines w i t h workpieces which are not p r e o r i e n t e d   there would be a s u b s t a n t i a l increase in the number of robots used in i n d u s t r y . a s i g n i f i c a n t c o n t r i b u t i o n to t h i s development would be a method which y i e l d s a t r a j e c t o r y whereby such a robot held workpiece can be transported from i t s recept a c l e to a machine f i x t u r e w i t h o u t a c o l l i s i o n . an a l g o r i t h m is described to f i n d such a t r a j e c t o r y . this a l g o r i t h m employs refinement of an i n i t i a l estimate of the p o s i t i o n and o r i e n t a t i o n of a robot held workpiece. the refinement procedure uses v i s u a l i n f o r m a t i o n . with the r e f i n e d e s t i mate of the hand-to-workpiece t r a n s f o r m a t i o n   the workpiece can be moved through a safe t r a j e c t o r y   which was e s t a b l i s h e d during a p r i o r i n s t r u c t i o n phase. 
       the a l g o r i t h m is based on l i n e a r p e r t u r b a t i o n theory. this means t h a t the change in a p a r t i c u l a r v i s u a l f e a t u r e on the workpiece can be app r o x i m a t e l y expressed as a l i n e a r f u n c t i o n of the p e r t u r b a t i o n s in workpiece p o s i t i o n and o r i e n t a t i o n  pose  r e l a t i v e to a nominal workpiece p¡êse. thus   b i r k   et a h   1   af - p ¦¤p  where ¦¤f = change in v i s u a l f e a t u r e v a l u e s   ap  = p e r t u r b a t i o n s in workpiece pose  and p = jacobian m a t r i x . 
¡¡¡¡¡¡during the i n s t r u c t i o n phase of the a l g o r i t h m when safe workpiece t r a j e c t o r i e s are def i n e d   the jacobian m a t r i x f o r each nominal pose is determined. f i r s t   the nominal pose is assumed 
by the r o b o t held workpiece as it is presented to two tv cameras. the robot arm j o i n t v a l u e s   f e a ture v a l u e s   and nominal pose are recorded f o r f u t u r e use. useful v i s u a l features include the cent r o i d   the area and the eigenvectors of the b i n a r y 
workpiece image. the workpiece coordinate system is then subjected to a sequence of known p e r t u r b a t i o n s   which may be accomplished by incrementing robot arm j o i n t s . for each movement  the c o r r e sponding changes in f e a t u r e values are measured. this permits the jacobian m a t r i x f o r t h a t nominal pose to be determined. this procedure is repeated f o r each s p e c i f i c nominal pose along the t r a j e c t o r y . 
       the execution phase a l g o r i t h m is used to r e f i n e the estimate of the hand-to-workpiece t r a n s formation   h t w   . a f t e r a workpiece has been acquired from a r e c e p t a c l e   htw is assumed to be known approximately. to v e r i f y t h i s   the d i f f e r ences in image f e a t u r e values from those e x t r a c t e d during i n s t r u c t i o n are computed. i f these d i f f e r ences are w i t h i n the bounds of the l i n e a r r e g i o n which were found d u r i n g i n s t r u c t i o n   the r e f i n e ment a l g o r i t h m can be a p p l i e d . 
       the p e r t u r b a t i o n s i n w o r k p i e c e pose can be c a l c u l a t e d from ¦¤p  = p +   a f     where p+ =  pseudo  inverse of p. ap defines a c o r r e c t i o n transformat i o n m a t r i x   t c   and t h e r e f o r e can be used to c o r r e c t the hand-to-workpiece t r a n s f o r m a t i o n   h t w   c =   h t w   t c - 1 . to ensure smooth convergence  a new hand-to-workpiece t r a n s f o r m a t i o n can be obtained by  htw new *    h t w c +   l - a     h t w   where 1 * a * 1. if the robot arm j o i n t values were adjusted to r e f l e c t t h i s updated estimate of n t w   then the workpiece pose should be closer to t h a t s p e c i f i e d duri n g i n s t r u c t i o n . 
       a f t e r moving the workpiece to a new pose based on   b t w   n e w   v i s u a l i n f o r m a t i o n is again ext r a c t e d . the c o r r e c t i o n procedure is repeated  t e s t i n g f o r convergence  u n t i l the d e v i a t i o n s 
which are used to update the hand-to-workpiece t r a n s f o r m a t i o n have been reduced to a l l f a l l w i t h in a tolerance zone.
