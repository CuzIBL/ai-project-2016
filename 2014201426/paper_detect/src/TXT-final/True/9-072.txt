   the eigenvalue of pattern of stress distribution on the surface of the receptor elements is derived from the lielmholtz equation. the element spacing of receptor is designed by using the relative error of the eigenvalue of the sampled pattern as the design specification. 
   a simple experiment classifying cylinders  trigonal prism and square pillar was performed by the artificial hand with multi-elements. as a result  a high percentage of correct answer is obtained  
	i 	introduction 
   some hand-eye systems and manipulators have already been constructed. these systems accept the information for satisfying the request of task sufficiently  which is given by a basic behavioral pattern of the system or relationship between an object and a tip of finger. the receptors of the a r t i f i c i a l tactile sense for giving the contact information with an object are a number of micro switches  strain gauge and conductive rubber. these elements are used for detecting the contact and 
the pressure information without crushing the object in 
the 	hand. 	1 
   t.b.sheridan has developed a prototype touch sensor having on its surface a deformablc mirror which distorts a regular grid pattern. the human operator observing the reflected image through a closed circuit television can infer the point by point pattern of normal forces on the gripping surface of the manipulator hand. 
   the authors have proposed the tactile model  whose elements convert the stress distribution to 1 the potent i a l distribution  and the varishold method for classifying its distribution. this paper describes the twodimensional pattern for each threshold and the element 
spacing 	of the a r t i f i c i a l tactile sense. 
	1. 	a prototype of the a r t i f i c i a l tactile sense 
   as the grasped object deforms the surface of the art i f i c i a l tactile sense  its stress distribution is given by the output of the tactile receptors. a schematic diagram of these receptors is shown in fig.l. the receptor elements or input are arranged at the node of regular net on the plane in the elastic material of the a r t i f i c i a l tactile sense . inner potential i in the receptors is compared with the threshold 1. 
   in case of the a r t i f i c i a l tactile sense being arranged close to each other  these inner potential of the receptors may be considered to be the potential distribution v  x y z  . the threshold is also considered to be the threshold distribution. moreover  if each threshold 1. of receptors has the same value  the threshold distribution p  oi.   in the a r t i f i c i a l tact i l e sense may be regarded is being a plane. 
   then  comparing the inner potential with the threshold distribution  an obvious geometrical relation is obtained among them as shown in the next section. 
1. dupin's indicatrix of the potential distribution 
   for the threshold distribution p{ b.   corresponding to the hyperplane of the potential distribution v x y  z   the relationship between p{ 1.   and v{ x y z   is described by the differential geometrical concept. 
   let us define a point of contact p 	between p  1.   and v  x y z  . we define the second  undamental differential form at a point of contact p 	on the threshold distribution. the second fundamental quantity is derived from its near surface of v  x y z   at a 
point of contact p . it is clear that to get the seccond fundamental quantity corresponds to discriminating the pattern which is proposed by the threshold distribution p  1. - a1   as shown in fig.1. 
   let us suppose the surface of the object is convex or concave within the region of surface of the tactile sense and v{ x y z   is described by the following parameter representation  
	v = v  u v   	  1 } 
   the second fundamental differential form of v u v  at a point of contact p can be expressed as the following equation. 
	ii = ldu1 + 	mdudv 	+ 	ndv1 	  1   
where l = v . e  m = v 	. e and n = v . e  uu 	uv 	vv 	' 
v 	= 1 v --   	e is a normal vector. 
1 u 
   l  m and n represent the second fundamental quantity of the parameter representation u and v. then  we have the following theorem from the shape of potential distribution for the second fundamental quantity l  m and 
n.

　i  at a point of contact p of the threshold d i s t r i bution pc 1     the points of v  u v   being near to the point pq are on one side of the threshold distribution pc 1  . if the point of contact p is the e l l i p tic point  the following equation is established.

where r and c are the connected domain and i t s boundary of pattern x   respectively. 
1 　as the a r t i f i c i a l t a c t i l e senses are arranged by a f i n i t e number of receptor elements  the output of r e ceptor elements expresses only the sampling value of d i g i t i z e d p a t t e r n . to solve the above equation using the d i g i t i z e d values of pattern is to use the f i n i t e difference method f o r eqs.  1  and  1 . as the eigenvalues of pattern depend on the area  the pattern is normalized by the f o l l o w i n g
