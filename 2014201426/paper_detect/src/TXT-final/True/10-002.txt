	i. 	introduction 
　　　learning has always been a magical word in ai. as long as there has been research in al  there has been research on learning as well  selfridge  1   samuel  1   winston  1   and sussman  1  being some notable examples . there seem to have been two approaches  not necessarily mutually exclusive  with respect to the learning issue; those who f e l t that any program they were building would be better off if it had some ability to learn new rules or new material  e.g. samuel  1   and those who f e l t that learning was a problem best pursued after we had a good idea of what it was that people knew in the f i r s t place. 
　　　for the last few years we have been developing conceptual repesentations for natural language information. these representations have been augmented recently to include larger knowledge structures such as scripts  plans  goals and themes  schank and abelson  1  . we believe that we have a handle on what kinds of representational structures for knowledge need to be learned  and we assume an adult understander can be effectively characterized in terms of such structures. the question is how are such structures and representational systems learned  
　　　to answer this question effectively  we believe that it is necessary to study how children learn. children are  after a l l   processors that seem to start with almost nothing  and become highly skilled language users. 
this work was supported in part by 	the 	advanced 
research 	projects 	agency 	of 	the department of 
defense and monitored under the office 	of 	naval 
research under contract n1-c-1 
　　　the particular domain of learning we are interested in is language acquisition. there is reason to believe that a child begins the process of learning language very early on. there is evidence that a child of one year has a l l of the primitive acts of conceptual dependency available for representing his knowledge  schank  1  . thus a child can begin learning a language equipped with predictions about the meaning of what he hears. 
　　　let us consider a simple example of the learning process: hana schank  at age one was asked to  put your finger in your ear . she did so. as far as we can t e l l it was the f i r s t time she ever responded to the word 'put' correctly.  if it was not the f i r s t time  then there was some other f i r s t time. the important point being that there has to be one f i r s t time . how did she do it  
　　　we advance the following hypothesis. she kn ew the words finger and 'ear'   she knew she was being asked to do an action  perhaps because a large number of the sentences that adults d i rect toward children of this age require them to respond by doing something.  she also knew and had used a l l the primitive acts and conceptual cases and relations in conceptual dependency  see schank  1a  for the argument about why this can be said to have been the case   she thus was able to reformulate the request into  pick a primitive act that has self as actor and can take finger and ear in one of its conceptual cases . this conforms to asking  what can i do with an ear and with a finger   the answer to the f i r s t is 'nothing'  a child this age knows nothing about the physical act of hearing and since it has never been asked to put its ear to anything is unlikely to think of doing this without exp l i c i t l y being shown how . the answer to what can you do with a finger is the primitive act move. thus the meaning of the request is a conceptualization which has 'hana' as the actor  move as the primitive act  'finger' as the object  and in which the source and goal of the directive case are unknown. it is clear where 'ear' must f i t in this conceptualization. it cannot be the source of the move since 'finger' is not currently located at 'ear'  so it must be the goal of the directive case. 
　　　thus the action is correctly performed regardless of her knowing the actual word ' p u t ' . furthermore  such correct actions and their accompanying rewards cause the word 'put' to become a candidate for meaning move.  actually 'put' means far more than move  but this is a good i n i t i a l hypothesis . what this really means is that hana already knew about 'putting' beforelearning the word for i t   as discussed above and in  schank  1a    and that this knowledge is 
exploited when learning the word. 
　　　the strategy employed by hana has been effectively modelled in the sam system by granger  1  in his foul-up program. foul-up is a program that has a deeper  more adult knowledge 

natural languagp-1 : 	schank 

base than hana has  but it exploits the same principle: predict the intent of a word based on the possible meaning it could take in context. 
　　　the above word meaning learning technique was gathered from our own observations of several children. in general  our ideas of what are interesting phenomena in language learning  and our ideas of the knowledge needed for such learning  have been formed from numerous informal sessions with children  rather than by formal experimentation. this does not mean that such theories 
need be hazy or ill-formed. since we are interested in process models of language acquisition  our theories must be quite specific if they are to be programmable. 
　　　it would be nice if we could exploit the research going on in psychology on children's acquisition of language. however  research in child language development has not produced results which are useful to us. it is our belief that the fundamental issues in child language research are ones of the. development of language comprehension  as opposed to generation   and the acquisition of world knowledge. psychology  on the other hand  tends toward a somewhat different point of view. the emphasis is usually on the production of language  rather than its comprehension  and attention is frequently focussed on the development of the syntax of language  rather than the evolving and growing meanings the child is able to deal with. furthermore  psychologists do not emphislze process models in their reseach  as ai does do  but are intereseted primarily in descriptive models. thus much current psychological research in language acquisition is not directly relevent to our interests and goals. 
　　　dale  1   for example  in a review of recent work in language developement  discusses at considerable length several theories of syntax acquisition in generation  but considers only relatively briefly the development of meaning in generation and understanding. he does not consider the role of an internal world model in the child's language learning. brown  1  and halliday  1  are examples of psychologists who indeed do present theories with semantic emphasis  but both are handicapped by the lack of an adequate meaning representation and by an inadequate notion of process. macnamara  1  comes closest to the philosophy of the authors  in that he suggests that an infant learning language a l ready knows  or can infer  much of the meaning of things that are said to him  and that his problem is to figure out how that meaning is encoded in the utterences he hears. macnamara doesn't discuss the kinds of 'available meanings' that a child might have  however  nor how a language-meaning relationship is constructed. 
i i . what to learn 
　　　in order to effectively approach the problem of learning in children it is a good idea to isolate stages of development and write mapping rules to get us from one stage to another. in this paper we w i l l describe the stages that children can be naturally said to be at. these stages represent the development of increasingly sophisticated world knowledge on the part of the child. we w i l l then discuss a set of programs which models parts of several of these stages  and which models aspects of the progression from one stage to the next. 
　　　when we talk of stages of development it is important to differentiate several kinds of stages. we w i l l argue here that there are at least seven types of things that are learned by a small child.  we are by no means saying that a child learns only these seven types of things. indeed  he learns considerably more than these. the things we w i l l talk about are those items crucial to the understanding process in adults that we have modelled in our computer understanding programs.  what follows is a summary of each of these seven items  along with a brief estimation of a child's a b i l i t i e s at these items at several different ages. we w i l l present no evidence backing up our assertions here since this is beyond the scope of this paper. instead we refer the reader to schank  1   schank and abelson  1   nelson  1   and nelson and gruendel  1  for the details and data backing up some of these assertions. 
conceptual dependency representation  cd : this is the representation system for events. the basic construct is actor-action-object-direction groupings. there are eleven primitive actions and a small set of relations between concepts  schank  1 . by age one  a child can use a l l of the primitive acts  and by age three and a half can converse about mental acts like mbuild. 
causal links: these are the relationships between events. there are two physical links and two mental links. there are also a few abstract relationships  schank   1b  . by age one  a child knows about physical causality  and by age three and a half can converse about mental causa l i t y . 
conceptual analyzer: this conforms to our parsing program for adults  riesbeck and schank   1  . it is a procedure that maps english strings into cd. a child of age one uses key-
words for parsing  and can  for example  point to objects. by age two  a child has added some cd  and can respond to commands. by age two and a half  the child is starting to use conceptual parsing  and can respond in a manner similar to adults. by age three and a half  he has understands when he knows something  and by age four is beginning to learn the rules for conversation. 
scripts: these are large  standard combinations of events that describe a well known situation such as a restaurant  going to bed  riding in a car  schank and abelson   1  . at age one  a child has formed simple scripts  but not until age two are they present for day to day use. by age two and a half scripts have been formed for a l l known situations  though a lack of informa-

natural 	l a n   u a   e - l : 	schank 
1 

tion about some situations leaves a child's script base incomplete at least through age three and a half. by age four  a child has basically an adult's scriptal a b i l i t i e s   though s t i l l lacking many particular scripts. 
plans: these are the general  goal-driven mechanisms that generate scripts  schank and abelson   1   meehan  1  . these develop slowly in a child. they are just starting to have significance by age three and a half  and are being used in understanding a l i t t l e by age four. 
generator: this is the mechanism for mapping concepts into sentences. a child can generate what are words to adults by age one or so. by age two four word sentences with action and object can be generated  and by two and a half or so paragraphs with short sentences are possible. when a child is three and a half and four his generation is nearly adult. 
memory: this is the storage mechanism for facts. the form of memory is muc h debated  however we can safely as sume children to have one. see rieger  1   quillian  1   norman and 
rumelhart  1  for various conceptions of what memory is 1 ike. in our terms  a child of age two  and poss ibly of age one   has episodic memory. by age two and a half or so  scriptal memory has been added  and by a ge three and a half a rudimentary s emantic memory exists. 
　　　we view a child as developing along a l l  and more  of these dimensions simultaneously. of course  the completed development of one facet of the child is often a prerequisite for the beginning of another. this is why conceptual analysis waits for cd and causal links to be completed. similarly  generation cannot begin seriously unt i l the script-based memory processes have given the child the a b i l i t y to organize its experiences 
and 	thus 	have something to say about its experiences. 
　　　it is our ultimate aim to simulate a child on the computer. that i s   we would like to have a program which possesses certain innate a b i l i ties  the a b i l i t y to grasp  the desire to move new objects to its mouth  to cry when hungry  for example   and which lives in a simple environment such as that a child lives i n . we would like to explore how learning can be modelled through i n teractions between the innate a b i l i t i e s and the environment to produce a program which develops the ability to understand. this i s   of course  a tremendously ambitious project. our f i r s t pass at i t   then  w i l l be to develop only one aspect of the child while faking the other developmental parts that are interdependent on that part. in this paper therefore  we w i l l discuss only the development of the conceptual analyzer. 
	i i i . 	learning to understand 
　　　we w i l l divide up the process of the acquisition of a conceptual analysis capability  hence parsing  into three distinct stages. naturally the development of parsing  like anything else  is really a continuous process  rather than one that proceeds by discrete stages. nonetheless  it is useful to maintain the stage division idea. this section describes a three stage model of the language acquisition in a child during his second year. the data for this model and the programs implementing it were obtained from observations of several children during the ages one to two. 
stage 1 
　　　at the end of the f i r s t year of a child's l i f e   he can usually understand  and respond to  questions of the form:  where is x  ; where x is a part of his body  a toy  a room  or the name of a person. his responses in the above four cases are: point to bodypart; get or point to the toy; go or point to the room; go or point to the person. the parser that is necessary to perform this task is relatively t r i v i a l . it requires knowing the name of the object and knowing the semantic relationships that determine the appropriate actions. the parsing part requires no more than recognizing an intonation pattern denoting a question  recognizing the name of the object  and determining from past experience what actions are associated with that object that the child could possibly be being asked to perform. 
　　　child 1 is intended to be a model of a one year old's parsing a b i l i t y . it accepts input sentences similar to those which might be addressed to a one year old  and prints out a conceptual dependency structure representing the behavior it is generating in response. it has a simple set of test-action rules  which build the structure  and a simple monitor which administrates the rules. the monitor looks at the words in the input sentence one at a time  and then sees whether there is a rule with a test that applies to that word in that situation. if it finds one  it executes its action. the successive execution of the actions of the rules builds the cd structure. 
　　　the test of a rule requires taking several things into account. in child 1  the rules test to see whether the word refers to a bodypart  a toy  a room  or a person  and whether the toy or person is near or far from where the program ' i s ' and whether  if far  whether the program is in the same room as the toy or person. 
natural lanruan -1: schank 　　　the rules which model this stage are written in lisp  as are the rules for the other two stages  and below are provided english statements of the rules. note that child1 has a short-term memory capacity of only one known word. 
rl  if a word refers to an object or place and no such word has been seen yet then load it into the short-term memory 
where it can be examined by other rules. 
r1  if a cd structure has not been built and the word refers to an object which is 'close' then construct the cd structure corresponding to pointing to the object  pointing to the object. 
r1  if a cd structure has not been built and the word refers to an object with is ' f a r ' then construct the cd structure corresponding to going to where the object i s . 
　　　below is a sample interaction with childi. the user's input is in lower-case letters  and follows a left-arrow prompter. childi responds by printing the conceptual dependency diagram corresponding to its action following the input. 
 go get the ball 
  actor  child  act  move  object  finger  to  ball  from  nil    
 where is roger   
  actor  child  act  ptrans  object  child  to  roger  from  nil    
 where is mallory   
  actor  child  act  move  object  finger  
to  mallory  from  nil    
 put the ball on the table 
  actor  child  act  move  object  finger  to  ball  from  nil    
 get the ball from in the kitchen 
  actor  child  act  move  object  finger  
to  ball  from  nil    
　　　note that no attention is paid to 'where'  or ' p u t ' . childi is only prepared to respond to words which signify things in the environment which it has behaviors to operate on. at this stage the same is true of children  who are happy to respond to  frimble mama  by pointing to mama if the intonation is question-like. 
stage 1 
　　　by age one. and a half a child can process sentences of the order of complexity discussed in the beginning of this paper. the child is learning words such as 'put' by relying on the primitive acts and the relationships that hold between them and their possible conceptual uses. thus  names of objects are learned f i r s t   but names of actions can be learned by associating unknown words with the action that the child has determined is the one he is being asked to perform. the child is learning to rely more heavily on the conceptual case requirements of the actions he is performing. thus  at the same time  he is also learning to handle two objects at a time in one sentence. that i s   he can also determine what possible relationship could hold between two objects and perform i t . sentences such as  put the ball in the box  can be correctly handled by the child precisely because the relationship he knows to hold between balls and boxes happens to be the one that is being requested of him. at this stage   put the ball near the box  is misunderstood as being identical with the sentence above.  this is due to the fact that ' i n ' relationships are usually more important than 'near' relationships in a child's world and are more likely to have been emphasized by his parents.  
　　　the model that accounts for this stage is a parser that is substantially the same as in the f i r s t stage  but with the exception that more than one object can now be handled. thus  the child more fully exploits the case requirements of the primitive action that he has selected to act out. ptrans  for example  when selected as being what you ordinarily do with a b a l l   requires a directional case which can be used to predict where other objects in the sentence might f i t in relation to the described action. thus  in the sentence  ball papa   if ptrans is the act  then the fact that the object of the ptrans must be 'ptrans-able' implies that the f i l l e r of the object slot is ' b a l l '   not 'papa'. since the actor must  at this stage  be the child  only the to and from slots remain to be f i l l e d . since the. ball is  presumably  near the child  it must be the to slot that is f i l l e d with 'papa'. unknown words  repeatedly used in conjunction with these inferred primitive acts  are learned as tags to the primitive acts directly. thus  in the sentence  put the cup on the table   the act ptrans can be inferred from what can be done with a cup and a table  and this information can then be attached to the unknown word ' p u t ' . 
natural 	lnnimiapt-l : 	sehank 　　　the program which models the child at age one and a half  childi.1  is structurally the same as childi. it uses the same monitor  and also has a set of rules which produce actions. the set of rules used by childi.b includes the same rules as those used by childi  plus several more. these allow for the construction of executable structures by taking into account constraints on what can f i l l what slot. these constraints are imposed by semantic information attached to words. in addition  childi.1 has a rule which allows it to take a conceptual structure which has been built by examining the known words in a sentence  and hypothesize that this structure is part of the meaning of other words in the sentence which it does not know. other rules  not yet a part of child 1 but under development  w i l l be used to refine such hypothesized meanings in order to specify precisely what conceptual structure should be built when a particular word is heard. childi.1 can deal conceptually with up to two words which refer to things or which have default actions associated with them. that i s   it can accomodate only two objects or words with default actions into its structure building process  and further such words are. ignored. its rules  in to addition the rules of child 1  are as follows. 
r1  if the input word is unknown  then save it for use by r1. 
r1  if the word has a primitive act associated with i t   then build the structure specified by the act and activate demons for f i l l i n g slots in that structure. 
r1  if one input word is associated with a default primitive act  and another input word refers to an object which f i l l s a a slot of that act's strucure  then build that structure and f i l l that slot with that object. 
r1  if the f i r s t word seen can build a structure which has a slot for the object referred to by the second word  then build that structure. 
 put the hat on the fribble 
  actor  child  act  ptrans  object  child  
to  hat  from  nil    
 put the cup on the table 
  actor  child  act  ptrans  object  cup  to  table  from  nil    
 put the hat on the rack 
  actor  child  act  ptrans  object  hat  to  rack  from  nil    
stage 1 
　　　by age 1 the simple program of stage 1 is expanded into a more complex one. children of age 1 can respond to the following kinds of sen-
tences: 
put the x in the y 	get your x 
do you want to z  	give me an x 
are you in 'some state' 	go into the y 

r1  if the second word seen can build a structure which has a slot for the object referred to by the f i r s t word  then build that structure. 
　　　rules r1  r1  and r1 implement the following idea: if there were two thing-words in the input  and one of them can have something done to it which involves the other  then that action 
must be the meaning of the input  and that structure is b u i l t . the rule below is a brief verbal description of child1's learning rule. 
r1  if an unknown word has been heard  and a cd structure has been activly  not by default  constructed  then 'hypothesize' that the f i l l e r of the act slot is associated with the unknown word by storing that act under the new word along with s l o t - f i l l i n g demons constructed by examining the f i l l e r s of the existing structure. 
the net result of this rule is to take an unknown word and associate with it information which w i l l allow it to be used by r1 to construct a cd structure for the input. below is a sample session with child1. note that child1 can integrate the meanings of several different words  but does not yet fully understand the meaning of sentences. in particular  it does not understand prepositions  but merely uses context and 'common sense'. note also that this session demonstrates child1 learning a meaning for the word ' p u t ' . 
it knows that the words 'hat' and 'rack' refer to objects  but it does not have any default actions associated with them. so  it uses one of childl's rules to generate a response. after learning what act 'put' refers to  by means of r1  above  it then can construct a meaning for 'put the hat on the rack'. 
 the cup is on the table 
  actor  child  act  ptrans  object  cup  
to  table  from  nil    
　　　clearly the parser of the year and a half old child has completed its work and many verbs have been learned. tt is tempting to argue at this point that a two year old child has a normal adult-like conceptual analyzer. however  we would prefer a less drastic progression from the one and a half year old parser to the two year old one. 
　　　the argument we w i l l make is that the two year old is a  key concept  parser rather than a key word parser. what distinguishes him from the one and a half year old is his knowledge of verbs and their associated prepositions  and his a b i l i t y to use the primitive act associated with a verb in order to predict slot instantiation in the conceptual structure being b u i l t .  note that prepositions can be learned in a manner analogous to that described for verbs above. that i s   when there are relationships between objects which the child has inferred must exist  unknown words in the input sentence are good candidates for names for these relationships. certainly other factors enter in  however. in order for a child to learn words other than ' i n ' in the ball and box example  it is necessary to repeat again and again to a child  no  near the box . this must also be accompanied by showing the child what exactly to do.  thus the two year old parser is a top down predictive analyzer  as is eli  our current parser  . when a verb is recognized the cases are predicted for it and objects present in the sentence are put into their correct conceptual place in accordance with the prepositions found. if the verb is not recognized  or the prepositions are not recognized  then the two year old reverts to the old techniques that worked before when he was younger. 
　　　before we present the program implementing our two year old model  we w i l l present some data from joshua schank  age 1 years  exactly . first a context is presented  and then joshua's reac-

　　　note that child1 by no means understands everything of what is said to i t . it does  however  make mistakes which are the sort that children make  and it constructs plausible meanings given the information it has. 
iv. conclusion 
　　　we have attempted to show in this paper that it is possible to model developmental stages of a child on a computer. rules that map one stage into another which make minimal assumptions  such as  somewhere between age one and one and a half a child begins to be able to construct conceptualizations in which more than one conceptual relationship obtains between the referents of the words in the sentence   could be used to get the computer model to develop automatically  as a child does. child1 contains a preliminary sample of such a rule. 
　　　we have two aims in this research. first  we are interested in how children learn to understand and we believe that building a computer model of such a process can shed light on questions regarding what knowledge must be innate  very l i t t l e we would suspect  and what knowledge is learned. 
　　　but we also have another aim. we  like most ai researchers  wish to build a learning machine. 
we believe that the most promising approach is to model natural developmental stages  as exhibited by children   and that a learning machine w i l l use processes similar to those employed by c h i l dren. 
　　　a learning model must start in the right place and make developmental sense. the child programs are only a very small start in that direction. we hope to uncover  by stepping our child through various stages of development  the learning principles that people actually employ.
