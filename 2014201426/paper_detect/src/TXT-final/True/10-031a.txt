in 	the 	system 	for 	p a r a l l e l 	representation 	of 
knowledge  spark  the ingredient of concern is not the h i g h - l e v e l   human-like  modeling of knowledge  but the compact  e f f i c i e n t   and e f f e c t i v e i n t e r n a l representation and use of the knowledge. spark employs a knowledge base representation technique which has been shown to be as much as seven times more e f f i c i e n t for information r e t r i e v a l than some other r e l a t i o n a l r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s . at the same time  t h i s technique  c a l l e d the p a r a l l e l representation  par  technique  can also compact the knowledge base by a f a c t o r of two or more. what d i s t i n g u i s h e s spark from data management systems is that t h i s e f f i c i e n t and e f f e c t i v e r e t r i e v a l mechanism also provides a powerful deductive inference c a p a b i l i t y . 
	two types 	of 	p a r a l l e l i s m 	are 	employed 	in 
spark  one achelved by data s t r u c t u r e s anc the other by p a r a l l e l processing. both are made possible by the d i s t i n c t i o n made between the   s t r u c t u r e   and the   c o n t e n t   of d a t a . in human problem solving the s t r u c t u r e is the general concept while the content is the sets of items which  when combined with the s t r u c t u r e   make one or more instances of that concept. thus   t r a n s p o r t i n g a from x to y  is a concept while 
  c a r r y i n g the block from the f l o o r to the t a b l e   is an instance of that concept with the content: c a r r y i n g ; b l o c k ; f l o o r ; and t a b l e . for the basic constructs  the i n d i v i d u a l f a c t s and inference r u l e s of the knowledge base  par employs templates to represent the s t r u c t u r e and sets to specify the content. for example  the c o l l e c t i o n of f a c t s about objects supported by the t a b l e would be given by: 
    r   x   y   {   s u p p o r t s   / r     t a b l e   / x   
 block cone lump hammer  / y   
where  r x y  is the template s p e c i f y i n g the concept of a binary r e l a t i o n w i t h two independent arguments. the sets associated w i t h r  x  and y can be used to form s p e c i f i c instances by appropriate s u b s t i t u t i o n s   in t h i s case simply ordered cross products of the s e t s . to index the knowledge base par employs meta-templates and super-sets in a corresponding manner. the indexing s t r u c t u r e proovides a compact form which f a c i l i t a t e s e f f i c i e n t search and r e t r i e v a l . thus the representation is p a r a l l e l because any s i n g l e symbol appearing in a par s t r u c t u r e can represent an unbounded number of instances of that symbol in the knowledge base. 
       the second type of p a r a l l e l i s m is m u l t i processing made possible by the meta-templates and super-sets of the index s t r u c t u r e . the meta-templates are cannonlcal b-trees which p a r t i t i o n the knowledge base i n t o d i s j o i n t c o l l e c t i o n s of d a t a . when a query p a t t e r n matches n meta-tempates  n independent processes may be created to complete the r e t r i e v a l match  thus performing many r e t r i e v a l s in p a r a l l e l . 
       spark  w i t h the par technique  is not posed as a panacea for a l l knowledge base management problems. several c o n s t r a i n t s were assumed in the development: 
 1  very large knowledge bases  more than 1**1 b i t s   are to be commonly employed. 
 1  there is a s i g n i f i c a n t degree of i n t e r r e l a t i o n s h i p among the elements of the knowledge base. if the knowledge base is viewed as a c o l l e c t i o n of n - t u p l e s   then any d i s t i n c t argument of a tuple has a high p r o b a b i l i t y of appearing in m u l t i p l e t u p l e s . 
 1  search and r e t r i e v a l are the preponderance of knowledge base o p e r a t i o n s . 
 a  search and r e t r i e v a l may be e q u a l l y l i k e l y f o r any combination of arguments  i . e . a query n - t u p l e may have i n s t a n t i a t e d any combination of argument p o s i t i o n s   the remaining p o s i t i o n s being l e f t f r e e . 
 1  the representation must a l l o w semantic  domain s p e c i f i c   c o n s t r a i n t s to be used in the search and r e t r i e v a l process. 
 1  sets should be treated as s e t s . 
 1  the representation should f a c i l i t a t e the use of i n f e r e n c e . 
these c o n s t r a i n t s appear to be q u i t e general and r e p r e s e n t a t i v e of a large v a r i e t y of r e a l i s t i c knowledge bases. 
       the p a r a l l e l representation technique employed in the spark system is posed as an approach to i n t e l l i g e n t knowledge base management   i . e . management employing inference  for very l a r g e knowledge bases. p r e l i m i n a r y r e s u l t s from a s i m p l i f i e d model and analysis of the technique i n d i c a t e the p o t e n t i a l for s i g n i f i c a n t storage and search processing savings over some other r e l a t i o n a l r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s . i t i s s i g n i f i c a n t t o note that the space savings due to the knowledge base compression a b i l i t y of par do not cause an increase in the e f f o r t required to search the knowledge base on the average. the search mechanism can accomplish i t s task more e f f i c i e n t l y in f a c t . this is due p r i m a r i l y to the e l i m i n a t i o n of any c o n f l i c t between the manner in which the i n f o r m a t i o n is stored and the manner in which it is u t i l i z e d by the search mechanism. because the par technique is intended as an i n t e r n a l repres e n t a t i o n of i n f o r m a t i o n it can be adapted to many 
d i f f e r e n t high l e v e l e x t e r n a l 	r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s . 
       the implementation and t e s t i n g of spark is c o n t i n u i n g at the naval research laboratory. once the system is f u l l y o p e r a t i o n a l experimentation w i l l be made w i t h large p r a c t i c a l knowledge bases to f u r t h e r determine the strenghts and weaknesses of spark and the par technique.
