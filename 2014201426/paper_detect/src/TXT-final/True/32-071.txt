 
in a graph with a  small world  topology  nodes are highly clustered yet the path length between them is small. such a topology can make search problems very difficult since local decisions quickly propagate globally. we show that graphs associated with many different search problems have a small world topology  and that the cost of solving such search problems can have a heavy-tailed distribution. the strategy of randomization and restarts appears to eliminate these heavy tails. a novel restart schedule in which the cutoff bound is increased geometrically appears particularly effective. 
1 	introduction 
graphs that occur in many biological  social and man-made systems are often neither completely regular nor completely random  but have instead a  small world  topology in which nodes are highly clustered yet the path length between them is small  watts and strogatz  1 . by comparison  random graphs with a similar number of nodes and edges have short path lengths but little clustering  whilst regular graphs like lattices tend to have high clustering but large path lengths. a small world topology can have a significant impact on properties of the graph. for instance  if you are introduced to someone at a party in a small world  you can usually find a short chain of mutual acquaintances connecting you together. 
　one reason for the occurrence of small world graphs is that it only takes a few short cuts between neighbourhood cliques to turn a large world  in which the average path length between nodes is large  to a small world  in which the average path length is small . watts and strogatz have shown that a social graph  the collaboration graph of actors in feature films   a biological graph  the neural network of the nematode worm c elegans  and a man-made graph  the electrical power grid of the western united states  all have a small world topology. in a simple model of an infectious disease  they demonstrate that disease spreads much more easily and 
quickly in a small world. a small world topology may therefore have a significant impact on the behavior of dynamical systems. how do they affect search problems

1 testing for a small world 
to formalize the notion of a small world  watts and strogatz define the clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length. the path length is the number of edges in the shortest path between two nodes. the characteristic path length  l is the path length averaged over all pairs of nodes. the clustering coefficient is a measure of the cliqueness of the local neighbourhoods. for a node with neighbours  then at most edges can exist between them  this occurs if they form a k-clique . the clustering of a node is the fraction of these allowable edges that occur. the clustering coefficient  is the average clustering over all the nodes in the graph. 
   watts and strogatz define a small world graph as one in which 	and where are the characteristic path length and clus-
tering coefficient of a random graph with the same number of nodes and edges  rather than this simple qualitative test  it might be useful to have a quantitative measure of  small worldliness . we can then compare the topology of different graphs. to this end  we define the proximity ratio 
as the ratio of normalized by in graphs with a small world topology  the proximity ratio 1. by comparison  the proximity ratio is unity in random graphs  and small in regular graphs like lattices. in table 1  we show that the proximity ratio   is large in those graphs studied in  watts and strogatz  1  with a small world topology.

1 modeling a small world 
　　watts and strogatz propose a model for small world graphs. starting from a regular graph  they introduce disorder into the graph by randomly rewiring each edge with probability p. if then the graph is completely regular and ordered. if then the graph is completely random and disordered. intermediate values of give graphs that are neither completely regular nor completely disordered. watts and

with probability p  we randomly rewire each edge. for clarity  = 1 and 	= 1 in the above example. however  larger n and 

k are used in the rest of this paper. 
strogatz start from a ring lattice with nodes and nearest neighbours. they observe similar qualitative behavior with other initial regular graphs and with other mechanisms for introducing disorder. a rewired edge is reconnected to a node chosen uniformly at random from the lattice. if rewiring an edge would create a duplicate edge  they leave it unchanged. 
to focus on large  sparse graphs  they demand that 
	where 	ensures that the 
graphs remain connected. for such graphs  	and and 	and 
 note that the proximity ratio  and this is small as 
and hence 	and 	by definition for 
that is  graphs do not have a small world topology for and p = 1. as increases from 1  the characteristic path length drops sharply since a few long-range edges introduce short cuts into the graph. these short cuts have little effect on the clustering coefficient. as a consequence the proximity ratio rises rapidly and the graph develops a small world topology. as approaches 1  the neighbourhood clustering start to break down  and the short cuts no longer have a dramatic effect at linking up nodes. the clustering coefficient and the proximity ratio therefore drop  and the graph loses its small world topology. these topological changes arc clearly visible in figure 1. 
1 search problems 
there are many search problems in ai that involve graphs  for example  the constraint graph in a constraint satisfaction problem  and the adjacency graph in a hamiltonian circuit problem . do such graphs have a small world topology  does this have an impact on the hardness of solving problems  if so  can we design algorithms to take advantage of the topology  
1 	graph coloring 
one search problem directly affected by the structure of an underlying graph is graph coloring. we therefore tested the topology of some graph coloring problems from the dimacs benchmark library. we focused on the register allocation problems as these are based on real code. table 1 demonstrates that these problems have large clustering coefficients like regular graphs  yet small characteristic path lengths like random graphs. they therefore have a small world topology.

we observed similar results with other problems from the di-
macs benchmark library 
1 	time tabling 
many time-tabling problems can be naturally modelled as graph coloring problems. we therefore tested some real world time-tabling problems from the industrial engineering archive at the university of toronto. table 1 demonstrates that sparse problems in this dataset have large clustering coefficients like regular graphs  but small characteris-

1 	quasigroup problems 
a quasigroup is a latin square  a m by m multiplication table in which each entry appears just once in each row or column. quasigroups model a variety of practical problems like tournament scheduling and designing drug tests. ai search techniques have been used to answer some open questions in finite mathematics about the existence  or non-existence  of quasigroups with particular properties ffujita et al.  1 . more recently  gomes and selman have proposed a class of quasigroup problems as a challenging benchmark for constraint satisfaction algorithms  gomes and selman  1. 
　an order m quasigroup problem can be represented as a constraint satisfaction problem with rn1 variables  each with a domain of size m. the constraint graph for such a problem  see figure 1  consists of 1m cliques  one for each row and column  with each clique being of size rn. calculation shows that  for large m  such constraint graphs have a small world topology. as any pair of entries in a quasigroup either directly 

figure 1. the constraint graph of a m by rn quasigroup problem for  the graph has  nodes and edges. the edges form cliques  each of size m. 
constrain each other or indirectly through at most one intermediate entry  the characteristic path length  is small. 
1 	search 
a random graph with the same number of edges and nodes also has a characteristic path length  as each variable has  neighbours and these form 1 m-cliques  the clustering coefficient  is large. a random graph with the same number of edges and nodes has a smaller clustering 
coefficient  and 
for large m  the constraint graph has a small world topology  with a proximity ratio  computation confirms these calculations  see table 1 .

1 	search cost 
graphs with a small world topology demonstrate that local properties  i.e. clustering  can be bad predictors for global property  i.e. characteristic path length . unfortunately  heuristics often use local properties to guide the search for a  global  solution. for example  the brelaz heuristic colors the node with the least available colors which is connected to the most uncolored nodes. because of this mismatch between local and global properties  a small world topology may mislead heuristics and make search problems hard to solve. to test this thesis  we colored graphs generated according to watts and strogatz's model using an algorithm due to mike trick  which is based upon brelaz's dsatur algorithm  brelaz  1. to ensure that problems were of a manageable size for this algorithm  we used graphs with and 
             for these graphs  the proximity ratio peaks around log1 p  similar to figure 1. whilst most graphs of this size can be colored without too much search  one graph was not solved in nodes and more than a week of cpu time. we therefore imposed a search cutoff at nodes. on a 1 mhz pentium  this is approximately 1 hour of computation. as we distributed our experiments over a variety of networked computers  we do not report runtimes but use nodes visited in the backtracking search tree. on any given machine  runtimes are roughly proportional to the number of nodes searched. 
　in figure 1  we plot the search cost against the rewiring probability   as  increases from 1 and graphs develop a small world topology  the search cost in the higher percentiles rises rapidly. however  as p approaches 1 and graphs lose their small world topology  the search cost in the higher percentiles falls back. for graphs with a small world topology  most problems took less than  nodes to color. however  1% took more than nodes. we suspect that problems with a small world topology can be difficult to color since local decisions quickly propagate globally.

1 	heavy-tailed distributions 
exceptionally hard problems like this have been observed in other search problems  though usually with less frequency. for example  gent and walsh found that a few satisfiability problems from the constant probability model were orders of magnitude harder than the median  gent and walsh  1 . grant and smith also found a few exceptionally hard problems in a random model of binary constraint satisfaction problems  grant and smith  1. more recently  gomes and selman have observed similar behavior in quasigroup completion problems  whose constraint graph  we recall  has a small world topology   gomes et al.  1 and in tournament scheduling  planning and circuit synthesis problems  gomes et al  1. they show that such behavior can often be modeled by a  heavy-tailed  distribution of the paretol1vy form. in such a distribution  the tail has the form  
 where is the probability that the variable x exceeds some value x  and 1 is a constant called the  index of stability . if 1 then any moment of x of order less than a is finite but higher orders are infinite1. for example  if  1  then x has finite mean but infinite variance. 
　　to test for such heavy-tails in the distribution of search costs  we plot the nodes searched against the probability that the search takes more than this number of nodes using log scales. a heavy-tailed distribution of the parcto-levy form gives a straight line with gradient  in figure 1  we plot the distribution of search costs at a variety of different values of  this figure shows that for graphs with a small world topology we can model the dis-
tribution of search costs by a heavy-tailed distribution of the pareto-levy form. the gradient suggests that the index of stability  that is  the model of the distribution of search costs has infinite mean and variance. by comparison  

   backtracking algorithms like dsatur have an upper bound on their running time that is exponential in the problem size. the mean or variance in their running time cannot therefore be infinite. however  for large problem instances  the upper bound may be so astronomically large that we can model it as if it were infinite. 
and more structured 
graphs search costs in the tail of the distribution drop more rapidly. 

figure 1. log-log plot of distribution of search costs to color graphs generated according to watts and strogatz's model with  =1   =1 and 
　as in  gomes et al.  1; 1   we observe similar heavy-tail behavior even when solving a single problem instance. we picked the first problem from the sample generated at  which took more than  nodes to solve. we re-solved this problem 1 times  randomizing the order of the nodes in the graph so that the brelaz heuristic makes different branching decisions. we again observe heavy-tailed behavior  with 1% of presentations of this problem taking less than 1 nodes to solve  but the rest taking more than  nodes. 
　a small world topology appears therefore to have a significant impact on the cost to solve graph problems. in particular  it often introduces a heavy-tail into the distribution of search costs. we conjecture that a small world topology will have a similar effect on other types of search problems involving graphs. for example  we predict that the distribution of costs for finding a hamiltonian circuit in a graph with a small world topology will often display heavy-tailed behavior. as a second example  we anticipate that exceptionally hard problems will be more common in constraint satisfaction problems whose constraint graph has a small world topology than those with a purely random topology. gomes  selman and kautz's state that  further studies are needed to determine what characteristics of combinatorial search problems lead to heavy-tailed behavior  page 1   gomes et al.  1 . our experiments suggest that a small world topology may be one answer to this question. 
1 	randomization and restarts 
to combat heavy-tailed distributions like this  gomes  selman and kautz propose the rrr strategy of randomization and rapid restart  gomes et al.  1 . this strategy prevents a search procedure from being trapped in the long tail to the right of the median  and exploits any heavy-tail to the left of the distribution  i.e. occasional runs that succeed very quickly . does such a strategy help when searching graphs 
	walsh 	1 

with a small world topology  does it eliminate this heavytailed behavior  in figure 1  we plot the search cost using the 

figure 1. the effect of randomization and rapid restarts on the cost to color a graph generated according to watts and strogatz's model with  - 1   = 1 and 
search is restarted after a fixed number of nodes have been visited. 
rrr strategy against the cuttoff parameter on the problem at  mentioned in the previous section. this problem has a small world topology and took the chronological backtracking search procedure over  nodes to solve. with a cutoff limit of between 1 x  to 1 nodes  the rrr strategy eliminates the heavy-tail in the search cost distribution. 
to determine a good cutoff value for the restart strategy  
gomes et al. suggest ... a trial-and-error process  where one experiments with various cutoff values  starting at relatively low values ...   gomes et a/.  1. to help automate this process  we suggest the rgr strategy of randomization and geometric restarts. each new trial has a cutoff value which is a constant factor   larger than the previous. this strategy profits from the success rate being high when the cutoff value is close to optimal. increasing the cutoff value geometrically ensures that we get close to the optimal value within a few restarts. we then hope to solve the problem within a few more restarts  before the cutoff value has increased too far from optimum. figure 1 shows that the rgr strategy is even better at reducing search than the rrr strategy on this problem instance. the rgr strategy was also less sensitive to the setting of the cutoff parameters than the rrr strategy. we obtained similar improvements on other problem instances. it would be interesting to see if the rgr strategy is effective on other search problems like planning and scheduling. 
1 	approximate entropy 
hogg notes that real constraint satisfaction problems often have variables that are more clustered than in random problems  hogg  1. he uses a notion of  approximate entropy  to distinguish between problems drawn from a clustered ensemble and those from a random ensemble. can approximate entropy act as a replacement measure for the clustering coefficient  
　the approximate entropy is a measure of the similarity between substructures in a problem. it therefore depends on

	hence  	depends only on 	and 	and 
not on the topology of the graph. we will need to consider for m 1 to distinguish random graphs from clustered ones. fortunately  the number of non-isomorphic subgraphs grows rapidly with so it is usually adequate to consider or in figure 1  we plot and  for randomly rewired ring lattices generated by watts and strogatz's model. as we take logarithms to base 1  the approximate entropy is measured in bits. the approximate entropy for subgraphs up to size 1 shows no obvious correlation with the rewiring probability  p  and therefore the clustering coefficient . unfortunately  computing the approximate entropy for larger subgraphs is not computationally practical as it involves considering all subgraphs of size 1  or  at least  a representitive sample of them . 
1 	related work 
grant and smith studied binary constraint satisfaction problems with a  braided  constraint graph similar to a ring lattice  grant and smith  1. in this problem class  exceptionally hard problems occur more frequently and with greater vigor than in a purely random ensemble. they suggest that  as problems met in practice are likely to have constraint graphs with

this sort of structure  such problems deserve further investigation. our research supports and refines these observations. 
　　to generate graphs with more realistic structures  hogg has proposed a clustered ensemble based on grouping the nodes into a tree-like structure  hogg  1. in a random ensemble  each graph with n nodes and c edges is equally likely. in hogg's clustered ensemble  an ultrametric distance between the n nodes is defined by grouping them into a binary tree and measuring the distance up this tree to a common ancestor. a pair of nodes at ultrametric distance d is joined by an edge with relative probability . if graphs are purely random. if p  1  graphs have a hierarchical clustering as edges arc more likely between nearby nodes. these graphs tend to have characteristic path lengths and clustering coefficients similar to random graphs. although nodes at the top of the tree tend to be more clustered than in random graphs  nodes lower down tend to be less clustered. we therefore need a more refined notion than the clustering coefficient to distinguish their topology from that of random graphs. 
1 	conclusions 
in a graph with a small world topology  nodes are highly clustered yet the path length between them is small. such a topology can make search problems very difficult since local decisions quickly propagate globally. to provide a quantitative measure of the extent to which a graph has this topology  we have proposed the proximity ratio   this is the ratio of the clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length  normalized by the values for a random graph with the same number of edges and numbers. using this measure  we have shown that many graphs associated with search problems have a small world topology  and that the cost of solving such search problems can have a heavy-tailed distribution. as in other studies  randomization and restarts appear to elimi-
nate these heavy tails. 
　what general lessons can be learnt from this study  first  search problems met in practice may be neither completely structured nor completely random. since algorithms optimized for purely random problems may perform poorly on problems that contain both structure and randomness  it may be useful to benchmark with problem generators that introduce both structure and randomness. second  simple topological features can have a large impact on the cost of solving search problems. in particular  search problems involving graphs with a small world topology can sometimes be very difficult to solve. it may therefore be useful to optimize algorithm performance for such topological features. third  randomization and restarts is again an effective strategy to tackle heavy-tailed distributions. the rgr strategy in which the cutoff value increases geometrically shows considerable promise. and finally  it really does seem that we live in a small world.
