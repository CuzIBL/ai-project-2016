 computer  referred here to as a system computer. it can also be a man with the neoessary training  or  for some types of problems  a computer supplemented with the model operations of informal oaloulus. 
the essential credit of these opera-
tions is their non-determination  i.e. ambiguity and informality of their results. consequently  the realization of various intellectual problems may proceed in different ways. thus we have a caloulus on hand  1  p.1   i.e. we have permission to carry out some operations. 
　　for example  if we add 1 and 1 with the aim of getting an arithmetic sum  we shall get number 1. however  if we add 1 and 1 with the intention of getting a new two-figure number  we shall get 1 further  if we add 1 and 1 with the aim of getting a new symmetrical figure  we shall get     but if we simply aim at 
any new figure  we shall get figures i1 or 1 or 1   i.e. three different possible results. obviously  it is the realization of some general summation operation that below will be referred to as the system summation operation. 
     it should also be noted that for the man informal calculus operations are strictly enough determinable by intuition as they  first and foremost  formalize oommon arithmetic operations with objects and notions. however  the use of such operations in intellectual problems does not serve the purpose of copying the structure of man's thinking. 
　　for realizing of informal caloulus operations it is neoessary to give rules governing the representation of real system on the level of a computer whioh 
1 
is able to realize these operations. 
　　in this oase  some real system   a   is represented by some set /a/  called 
here the system representing structure  of the symbols of the chosen alphabet 
for describing the elements and the links 
in the system   a     the context  1  of which is meaningful for its goal k. in other words   1  and  1  together protide for an unambiguous representation of the system a in the structural form of /a/  retaining the goal e. the goal k makes it possible to eliminate from the observation a great number of elements and practically a l l the links of the real system  and it also dictates a strict suocesion in  1 . 
　　let us c a l l such a oomplex of elements and links of the system  a    arranged into a succession aooording to the goal k a sequence of numerals of the system  a  with respect to the goal z  and the very successive elements and links of this system in consideration of their interaction - numerals of the system  a  with respect to the goal k. 
　　it is possible to eliminate the unnecessary elements and links from the real system and to arrange the remaining one1 into a sequence only in case we have sufficient general knowledge in the field of soience to which the given system and its respective goal k belong. 
　　for the i n i t i a l operation 	of informal calculus 	the 	taking of a 	decision when two objects or notions  a  and 	 b  coincide 	according 	to the 	goal 	k has been chosen. here  this operation is designated as the system coincidence operation and 	is 	marked 	by 	the following 
1 

     it is generally known that a f o r e man  despite the condition  in separate element-pairs  can  nevertheless  determine that  the state of production is normal   i.e. 

by subonsciously taking into considera t i o n a wide range of f a c t o r s . 
     the indloated problems may be r e lated to the i n t e l l e c t u a l ones as the direct apparent information in t h i s oase is incomplete. if the problems are r e a l ised in a system oomputer  the p a r t i c i pating objects or notions  which w i l l be ohosen by the goal k and transferred by it into sequences  are called in the apparatus described here - the sequences of numerals. 
     as an example  l e t us follow the formation of the sequence of numerals of the system   c   w i t h the respective goal 
k1 -  formation of pieces of f u r n i t u r e f o r s i t t i n g   . 
     it is known that there are except i o n a l l y many types of such pieces   i . e . systems   l i k e chairs  armchairs  seats of various styles. 
     the formation of the sequence of numerals should follow the complex of knowledge pertaining to  and however  in the present report examples have been s i m p l i f i e d and t h i s complex of knowledge has been replaoed by the f o l l o w i n g two rules which take i n t o acoount only f u n c t i o n a l properties of the system   c   elements  though t h e i r techn o l o g i c a l   ornamental and other possible properties should also be considered. 
     1. an element of the system with the highest f u n c t i o n a l meaning should stand in the sequence of numerals before an element w i t h a lower functional meaning. 
     1. the sequence of numerals must 	be 
preserved in correspondence with the given goal k if elements of lower functional meaning are exoluded. 
　　　in this oase  the sequence of numerals for the system   c   with respect to the g o a l a c q u i r e s the following structure  

the c ircumstanoe  that the following structures 

are incorrect sequences of numerals of the system  c  and do not satisfy the goal k  can easily be proved if we apply to them the above-stated rules. 
     on the other hand  we can see that when we check the conformity of the highest functional elements of  1  and  1  following the goal k with those of  1  as a whole  we accomplish the system coincidence operation  

where 
　　no - stands for the lack of system coincidence. 
     the following operation  that in system sense is opposite to that of system coincidence operation  should be of great importance in intellectual problems. it is the operation of searching for a coincidental system   

where 
  a   is the initial system  
k 	the goal in the search for a coincidental system for  a    
/b/ the result of the operation  i.e.   b   is the system that has system coincidence with /a/ with respect to the goal k. 
1      this operation will be realized by searching for the coincidental system from the whole capacity of the memory of 
the system computer which can be: an abstraot system computer  man with ad-
equate training  and for some sets of problems  a usual computer with a model that  in addition  includes the model of the system ooincidence operation. 
the system summation operation 

represents 	the joining 	of 	two systems 
 a  and  b    and their resultant system  b  will have new qualities determined by the goal k. here /arest bhbgt/ are the unused elements of the systems   a   and  bl-
     the applioat ion of the described operation allows to lay down the realisation of a highly intellectual problem  as for example  the formation of a new system of generalized oomplex notions from two systems of elementary notions. in the development of science we find well-known examples of this operation  like the formation of mathematical eco nomy from the concepts of mathematics and economy  or physical geography from physios and geography. 
     this requires the joining of the structures representing i n i t i a l systems  a  and  b  of elementary notions a  and b.: 

into a new system  d  of complex notions d   the representing structure of which will be 

     if the problem is presented in a generalised form  the contents of the goal of the system summation operation will be the following  
k -  formation of complex notions * 
let 	us 	oonslder the required algorithm 	of the system summation operation in an example. 
     1. using the system ooinoidenoe operation with respeot to the goal k we oheok the general principal potentiality of each element a  of the system   a   to form oomplex notions with the elements of the system f b 1 : 

t i a l complex notions a f i n a l comprehensive system of complex notions  we must introduce a basic system  e    

     as a r u l e     b   represents a system of generalised notions f o r the presupposed elements of the system  d  . the system  e  may also be taken from the branch of science analogical to that of the system   b   . 
     in t h i s way  the application of   e   must guarantee the meaningfulness of the next step of the decision. 
     1. elements of the 	f i n a l system-var i a n t 

come f o r t h w i t h the use of the operation of searching f o r a coincidental system tor eaoh element of the system e separately. the search here inoludes the structure of i n i t i a l variants of complex 
notions / a 1 : b 1 / : 

in t h i s oase  the goal k1 stands f o r   
k  -  to secure the greatest meaningfulness**   
     the operation of searching f o r a coincidental system as stated before  is realised by the use of system o o i n o i -
1 

deno e operation in the struo tur e of common algorithms. consequently  the system summation operation  according to the described algorithm  oan be realized on oonditlon of the realization of the system oolncldenoe operation. 
　　for many problems of taking intel* lectual decisions a model of operation of system coincidence can be implemented for a usual computer. 
　　one of these models has been successfully tested by the author for the realization of the problem  determina-
tion of the normal state of production   which has been described in 	the beginning of the report.
