excuse that this explanation is still at an infant stage of development. the statement allows us to reconcile our observations of real behavior with the theoretical belief in attentional limitations by saying that  well  not everything requires attention  not once it is well learned regardless of what you might think of the statement and o  the lack of specificity in the arguments  there is another problem with the approach; the attentional limitations are only part of the problem we still don't know how any organism can simultaneously perform many tasks what kind of structures are necessary  and which are really present in the human  how can we account for the errors that people make  
　　　now turn to computers and  in particular  the work in artificial intelligence let me quickly assure half of my audience and warn the other half -- that ai doesn't have any idea of how to handle the problem either. the relationship between the study of artificial intelligence and human intelligence should go two ways  and although psychologists have often taken more from ai than ai has taken from us  i think the direction ol the information flow is changing. in this case we are equals  there is only a weak ebb between two stagnant pools 
　　　most of the intelligent programs that have so far been developed within ai are single minded  experts in their single domain of inquiry  but unable to deal with any other domain even when there are systems that can deal with several different domains or sub-domains of a topic  they do them in a sensible fashion  one at a time  rather than in the inelegant  cluttered human fashion of attempting to think of everything at once  mixing up the concepts of one with those of the other the virtue for the computer is elegance and power the virtue for the human is creativity and flexibility 
b. human error is suggestive of a special form of mechanism 
　　　i want to argue for a different kind of processing mechanism than is usually considered by people within artificial intelligence in the end. it may not be wise to model many aspects of human intelligence with conventional processing structures but before 1 get to that. let us review the argument 
　　　the multiple-purpose  multiple processing aspect of our behavior leads to difficulties 1 have already listed some phenomena that imply interactions among processing structures in this paper i concentrate upon the form of human errors thus  we make errors. we are easily distracted by events  stopping to do things we had not intended  or we are captured by habitual acts  performing them instead of the ones intended at times  we can be data driven  responding to sensory signals  whether we intended to or not. this can be useful  for it allows us to react appropriately to unexpected events in the environment it is not so useful when data driven processing interrupts our intended actions  at times so distracting us from our intentions that we neglect to complete them these errors imply that we neither separate the tasks well nor switch completely among them as a result  we intermix components  lose track of our status on any given task  and oftentimes do the right thing on the wrong occasion 
　　　errors give insight into the system  for they offer powerful clues as to the operation of the underlying mechanism we need not agree with freud's view that  the meaning in them is unmistakable  even to the dullest intelligence  and strong enough to impress even the most critical judgment   but we can still agree that they are strongly suggestive errors can be divided into several different categories i divide errors into two major classes mistakes and slips  with the division being whether the error occurred prior to or alter the formation of the highest level intention i define a mistake to be an error in forming the intention thus  a mistake can result from knowledge that is erroneous or incomplete  either in the information that the person brings to the situation or that is available from the environment. the mistake can also arise in the psychological mechanisms of decision and planning that arc involved in the formation of the intention. i define a slip to be a failure in carrying out the intention properly. that is  the appropriate action is started  but somewhere along the path of execution it is diverted or deflected 
　　　there are several collections of slips  1 1 . the instances are both humorous and informative a business executive roared  come in  instead of  hello  when answering the telephone a friend politely said  come in  instead of  sit down  when inviting a new person to join the two of us at a table in a hotel restaurant * pilots have raised the landing gear instead of the flaps one person reported cleaning a fish and throwing the cleaned fish overboard  keeping the entrails in preparing for a party  one person put the cake in the refrigerator and the salad in the oven. computer users report numerous errors typing commands into the text editor while in  insert  mode  or text while in  command  mode; deleting files instead of moving them there are data-driven errors  in which the sight of something leads to an unintended action - one of my students calls this the  parking spot error  if you come across a parking spot while driving through a city  you may find yourself parked in it  even if you had no intention of stopping there  the same student reports dashing into an elevator that happened to open its doors just as he was walking by  even though he hadn't meant to lake an elevator   a reasonably common typing error is the  doubling error  doubling the wrong letter in a word  yielding bokk or claas instead of book or class 
　　　examples of slips can be found in both speech and motor actions one example is to select the wrong word  as in  wouldn't it be cheaper  i mean faster  to go that way   i classify this as a  description  error  one that results from an error in memory retrieval the word that was first retrieved shares features of the se mantic description of the intended word the error can perseverate  as in  they have chinee -- japa - mexican food to go   
　　　there are other forms of verbal slips a blend occurs when two competing patterns are merged  as in  clut  which merges  close  and  shut   in a spoonerism  components of the words arc interchanged  as in  ruman and normalhart  instead of the in tended  norman and rumelhart    the examples come from norman  1  and fromkin  1 .  
　　　freud made the point that most errors have multiple causes  and that seems to be true of these as well lor the several people who have reported going to their bedroom to change clothes for dinner and finding themselves undressed and in bed  they may have been  captured  by performing the initial stages of a familiar habit and unconsciously completing the familiar instead of the intended  but they may also have been unconsciously attempting lo avoid the dinner the invitation to  come in  to the restaurant table could have been affected by the fact that one ol us was sitting in a semi-enclosed booth  and the person who made the slip so ar gued  in my experience  these subtle  clinical interpretations seem initially far-fetched  hut are confirmed with surprising frequency by the people who make the slips thus the puzzle for those who wish to figure out the mechanism  how do different sources of information interact to lead to slips  while also accounting for the fact that most of our actions  irc correct '.' 
　　　the various phenomena i have described  plus others  imply that the parts of action sequences are neither strongly ordered not tightly coupled that is  i think that the biological system is strut-

lured so as to use ambiguous information for memory search  to allow itself to be responsive to multiple sources of information  to 
combine and overlap data paths  and to deliberately intermix what one would have thought to be independent processing streams although these properties can lead to errors  1 believe that they are also exactly the sort of thing that gives us much of the power of human creativity and judgement  lo allow us to be tolerant of noise and of error  to behave flexibly  to respond in imaginative and creative ways to novel events  and to be able to shift our strategies and behavior when the situation shifts 
　　　the basic concept is simple we assume that the human information processing system is mediated by means of many separate processing structures  each of which can do only simple operations  but each of which is coupled to numerous other structures we call these structures schemas  and we allow each to have an activation value that excites or inhibits its neighboring schemas and is triggered into controlling an action sequence whenever the combination of its activation value and the goodncss-of-fit of its specific trigger conditions exceed a threshold value  for a closely related argument and description of computational structures  see .  for present purposes  all that is needed is the understanding that there are independent processing structures  each capable of controlling action  and that synchronization and cooperation among them is handled by activation and inhibition links among schemas more discussion can be found in 1 1 1  
task is expert typing  and detailed study of the typist reveals some interesting insight into the nature of skilled human performance typing is a single task that requires multiple control of the 1 ringers and 1 hands - there are 1 tendons and 1 joints involved simply in the movement of the fingers. study of typing is today one of the major themes in our laboratory  and the analyses of typing errors and typing performance tell us quite a bit about the nature of cooperative interaction among simultaneous activities. at this point 1 will only mention two aspects of skilled typing. one is the doubling error in which the wrong letter in a word is doubled  so that a word like book or manner is typed as bokk or maaner the other is the overlapping nature of the execution of the finger movements {1. the finger movements start several letters ahead of their scheduled arrival time  oftentimes out of sequence of the final temporal order in which they arc made. it is as if each finger starts as soon as it can towards its intended target  and the hand appears to cooperate  configuring itself so as to make maximum movement towards as many targets at a time as possible 
　　　this latter example is important  for it illustrates a situation in which simultaneous tasks cooperate rather than compete this cooperation among possible competitive tasks happens frequently. suppose you wish to pick up several pencils and a piece of paper at the same time  using only one hand the normal finger movements that would be performed were only one object to be picked up are modified to allow for cooperation among the fingers and hand to accomplish the multiple goal i predict that one of the changes that 
　　　
occur in performance as a person becomes expert is a change from mutual competition of simultaneous actions to mutual cooperation the behavior therefore changes from doing but a single action at a time to overlapping  cooperative performance of several simultaneous acts.

istence of of doubling and alternation errors pose special problems consider the word book. according to our arguments  the word would be represented by schemas for each of the letters; b o o k . it is easy to see how such a representation could lead to transposition errors  such as boko  but not to doubling errors it would be easy to make up a schema for a doubled letter  so that the word would be represented by the schemas bdouble-ok   but this would not lead to the doubling errors cither 
the doubling error turns out to have two major implications 
first  it implies that there are special schemas that signal the existence ol doubled letters  and that occasionally these schemas get applied to the wrong letters in a computational terms  this means that the binding between the arguments of the special schemas lor doubling occasionally get made improperly second  the need for a special schema to mark doubled letters implies a difficulty in having the regular letter schema signal the double why isn't the word book represented by the schemas b o o k   the reason would seem to be that this would require two instances  types  of the schema for o  the existence of the doubling error implies that such repeated tokens of a schema might not be possible 
thus  the existence of doubling errors forced us to a pure 
 type  model  in which each letter could only have a single keypress schema  the keypress schemas exist only as  types   with no  token  schemas there must be a special schema that signals the presence of a doubled letter. moreover  there must be a weak binding between the special schema and the arguments upon which it operates in our model  we let the binding be established via activation values  with noise sometimes leading to errors in the bind ing. the existence of alternation errors led to the same conclusion  special schemas that signal the presence of alternating letters  with a weak hinding between the schema and its arguments 
i i i . on possible psychological mechanisms 
　　　we see that there are several different aspects of skilled behavior 
i competition among actions  so that the doing of one thing inhibits the doing ol another for some combinations of actions  the mechanisms required are incompatible  so that the competition is necessary and in these cases some sort of priority or inhibitory processes are re quired 
1. cooperation among actions  so that the operations of one action arc modified to accommodate another. in this situation  most noticeable with skilled performers or with highly distinct  compatible actions  the simultaneous actions must engage in some process of  negotiation  to permit mutual performance thus  if one wishes to car ry several objects at the same time -- for example  several pencils  a piece of paper  and a cup -- the normal movements and positions of the fingers  hands  ami arms'will be altered to make the cooperation possible 
1 slips of performance  so that the components of one action sequence may get mixed up with the components ol another  or the memory or the resource requirements for one will interfere with the requirements for the other  and so on 
1 non-independence of action  so that the performance of one activity cither affects or causes the performance of others  even when these other activities would appear to be quite unrelated it is as if there were an overflow from the activation of one set of processing structures to neighboring structures  in which the major source of interaction results from physical proximity of the process ing structures rather than from logical relationships among the activities being performed  for an interest-
ing review of this concept  sec |1|.  
　　　these different aspects of simultaneous performance provide hints as to the nature of the underlying mechanisms i have already suggested that the doubling error in typing says something of the underlying representational structure  and of the possible mechanisms for binding a function to its arguments slips provide constraints on the nature of the underlying representational and processing mechanism fxaminalion of skilled typing provides another source ol evidence  requiring some mechanism that can yield cooperative behavior among the fingers and hands studies of attention and of neurological deficits provide yet another source ol information 
　　　in our attempt to construct a processing model of these aspects of human behavior we have been forced to deviate from the more traditional processing structures. instead  we find that a vi able structure seems to require multiple  parallel units  all interacting with one another  activating  and inhibiting  one another  with a tradeoff between activation value and the goodness to fit to trigger conditions. the scheme that we propose is a relative of production 
systems  but the control structure that we propose is somewhat different 
a. the role of will in the control of action 
　　　w'e postulate that skilled action sequences are automatic  no conscious control of them is necessary however  because people sometimes perform ah action when the conditions are not com pletely satisfactory  or hold back an action even when it would otherwise be appropriate some other form of control is required in 1   we suggest that the normal configuration of schemas thai per form an operation can be thought of as a horizontal thread of control  the name taken from the fact that the processing structure lor some even sequence is often depicted as a series of hori/ontal pro cessing stages  in normal circumstances  the hon/onial thread suffices to carry out the action  with component schemas being ing gered when their activation values and trigger conditions are satis factory however  attentional  conscious  control is necessary when there is concern about the adequacy of the horizontal thread structures  as m ill learned tasks  novel situations  or situations pet ceived to be dangerous  this is done through control of the activation values of schemas by means of vertical thread structures the application ol attentional activation to bias the control of the horizontal thread schemas we called  will   thus  by the exertion of will  one can cause a schema to be triggered even if it would olh crwise not have been or to prevent a schema from being triggered that would otherwise have been 
　　　the application of vertical thread activation  will  is best illus traled by the situation where one wishes to perform an undesirable act  such as getting out of bed on a cold morning  or to prevent a desirable act  such as eating any more of a rich and tasty desert  in both cases will is required  in the former to increase the activation values sufficiently to cause triggering of the schema even m the absence of a sufficiently good fit of the triggering conditions  and in the latter case  to prevent an activity  even though the nor mal activation values and triggering conditions have been met in the lattet case  continual attentional effort is required  for if attention lapses  the schema will revert to its normal activation values and triggering conditions  and the action will be performed 
　　　the models of human processing suggested here need not be the only candidates. i mention them because they are suggestive of the sort ol processing structures required to account for human performance the important point is that conventional processing structures can not describe human behavior  a new breed of computational mechanism must be developed
