
one of the major tasks in swarm intelligence is to design decentralized but homogenoeus strategies to enable controlling the behaviour of swarms of agents. it has been shown in the literature that the point of convergence and motion of a swarm of autonomous mobile agents can be controlled by using cyclic pursuit laws. in cyclic pursuit  there exists a predefined cyclic connection between agents and each agent pursues the next agent in the cycle. in this paper we generalize this idea to a case where an agent pursues a point which is the weighted average of the positions of the remaining agents. this point correspond to a particular pursuit sequence. using this concept of centroidal cyclic pursuit  the behavior of the agents is analyzed such that  by suitably selecting the agents' gain  the rendezvous point of the agents can be controlled  directed linear motion of the agents can be achieved  and the trajectories of the agents can be changed by switching between the pursuit sequences keeping some of the behaviors of the agents invariant. simulation experiments are given to support the analytical proofs.
1 introduction
agents swarms are multi-agent systems or groups of autonomous mobile agents used for automated collaborativeoperations. the challenge in these applications is to design intelligent control laws such that the agents behave as desired without a centralized controller or global information. linear cyclic pursuit is one such control law which is designed to mimic the behavior of biological organisms. bruckstein et al.  bruckstein et al.  1  modelled this behavior with continuous and discrete pursuit laws and examined the evolution of globalbehavior. convergenceto a pointin linear pursuitis the starting point to the analysis of achievable global formation among a group of autonomous mobile agents as discussed by lin et al.  lin et al.  1  and marshall et al.  marshall et al.  1a . the stability of both linear and nonlinear pursuit has been studied in marshall et al.  marshall et al.  1b .
¡¡the present work is a generalization of the cyclic pursuit problem discussed in the literature. marshall et al.  marshall et al.  1b  studied the stability of linear system of n agents with equal and positive controller gains. bruckstein et al.  bruckstein et al.  1  briefly mention a case where the controller gain may be inhomogeneous but positive. sinha et al.  sinha and ghose  1a    sinha and ghose  1b  further generalized it by considering negative gains also. the controller gains are considered to be decision variables to determine the global behavior of the system. in the present paper  we assume inhomogeneous gains that can take both positive and negative values. further  the connection among the agents are generalized through a pursuit sequence that makes the agents follow the weighted centroid of the other agents.
¡¡we define a pursuit sequence as a set of weights used by an agent to find its leader. the range of values of the controller gain that stabilizes the system is obtained. selecting from among the stabilizing controller gains appropriately  it is possible to control the point of convergence  reachable point  of the group of agents.
¡¡one of the behaviors that is important for various applications of such groups of autonomous agents is obtaining directed motion in a particular direction. we show that when the system is unstable  under certain conditions  all the agents' movement converge to a single asymptote. we obtain the condition on the unstable controller gains for which such motion is achievable. finally  we show that generalized linear cyclic pursuit with heterogenous gains posses several interesting invariance properties with respect to the sequence of pursuit between agents. in particular  we show stability invariance  reachable point invariance and invariance of an asymptotic point in the directed motion case. we also prove these invariance properties for finite number of switching between different cyclic pursuit sequences.
1 formulation of centroidal cyclic pursuit
generalized linear cyclic pursuit is formulated using n agents numbered from 1 to n in a d dimensional space. the position of the agent i at any time t ¡Ý 1 is given by
 zi t  =  yi1 t  yi1 t ...yid t  t ¡Ê rd i = 1 ... n.  1  control of agent i is ui. the kinematics are given as

where. note that  each individual term  in the above expression  is of the form ¦Çjzi+j mod n. thus  agent i pursues a weighted centroid of the other agents and ¦Çj is the weight given by agent i to the position of agent  i + j   modulo n  using which the centroidal pursuit is executed. the weight vector ¦Ç =  ¦Ç1 ... ¦Çn 1  is called the pursuit sequence. one of the simplest pursuit sequences is ¦Ç = {1 ... 1}  where the first agent follows only the second  the second follows only the third and so on till the last agent follows only the first. further  ki is the controller gain of agent i and ki need not be the same for all the agents. using different values for the controller gains  we analyze the behavior of the agents.
¡¡from the control law  1   we see that  for every agent i  each coordinate yi¦Ä ¦Ä = 1 ¡¤¡¤¡¤  d  of zi  evolves independently in time. hence  these equations can be decoupled into d identical linear system of equations represented as
	x¨b = ax	 1 
where

and.	note that a is singular.	here  x =
 x1 x1 ¡¤¡¤¡¤  xn   where each xi represents a yi¦Ä for some ¦Ä = 1 ¡¤¡¤¡¤  d. we drop the superscript '¦Ä' since the equations are identical in all the d-directions  except for the initial conditions . let. the characteristic equation of
a is
     ¦Ñ s  = sn + bn 1sn 1 + ... + b1s + b1  1  where bi i = 1 ... n   1 are functions of ¦Ç and k. the following properties can be shown to hold:
1.
1.
1. is a function of number of agents n.
1.
¡¡we omit the proofof the aboveproperties. these properties can also be easily verified using any mathematical  symbolic  toolbox like mathematica. since  b1 is not necessarily zero  there is one and only one root of a at the origin. the solution of  1  in the frequency domain is
	x s  =  si   a  1x 1 	 1 
expanding the ith component of x s   we get
		 1 
where  are functions of k and s. let the non-zero roots of  1  be rp =  ¦Òp + j¦Øp  p = 1 ¡¤¡¤¡¤  n¡¥   1  where n¡¥ is

the number of distinct roots of  1 . taking inverse laplace transform

where  np is the algebraic multiplicity of the pth root and

here  xf corresponds to the root s = 1.
¡¡the trajectory xi t  of agent i depends on the eigenvalues rp =  ¦Òp + j¦Øp  p = 1 ¡¤¡¤¡¤  n¡¥  of a which  in turn  are functions of the gains ki i = 1 ¡¤¡¤¡¤  n. if all the eigenvalues of a have negative real parts  then the system  1  is stable. in the next section  we will find the combination of the gains for which system  1  is stable.
1 stability analysis
if the system  1  is stable  as t ¡ú ¡Þ  x¨bi t  = 1  i. this implies that eventually all the agents will converge to a point. thus  we have the following result.
theorem 1 the system of n agents  given by  1   will converge to a point if and only if the following conditions hold
 a  at most one	is negative or zero  that is  at most for
 .
proof. the  if  part is proved using gershgorin's disc theorem  horn and johnson  1 . we consider three cases:
case 1: all gains are positive.
here  ki   1  i. therefore  condition  b  is automatically satisfied. the gershgorin's discs are shown in figure 1 a . since one and only one root of  1  is at the origin  the remaining n¡¥  1 roots of  1  must be on the lhs of the s-plane and have negative real parts. it remains to be shown that the root at the origin does not contribute to the dynamics of the system.
consider a subspace
= constant. we can show that
s is a-invariant and there exists a linear transformation using a non-singular matrix p  given by 
	1	1	¡¤¡¤¡¤	1  
	1	1	¡¤¡¤¡¤	1
	p =    ...	...	...	...       	 1 
	   1	1	¡¤¡¤¡¤	n1	1n
	k1	k1	k1	¡¤¡¤¡¤	k 1	k1
a n 1 ¡Á n 1 1	¡¤¡¤¡¤	1such that the new coordinate system is x  = px and  1  transforms to  x = x	 1 
¨b
where the elements of a are functions of k. here  x ¨bn = 1. thus  we can disregard exactly one zero eigenvalue and determine stability based on the remaining n   1 eigenvalues of a. hence  the system is stable when ki   1  i. case 1: one gain is zero and other gains are positive.
here  for some   i = 1 j 1  . gershgorin's discs is the same as in case 1  fig 1 a  . following similar arguments as in case 1  we can show that the system is stable. case 1: one gain is negative and other gains are positive.
the gershgorin discs  when i 1 j 1    are as shown in figure 1 c . when the system becomes unstable  from the continuity of the root locus  the roots have to pass through the origin to move from lhs to rhs of the s-plane. we can find the point at which the first root crosses the origin by equating the coefficient of s in  1  to zero  i.e. 
		 1 
since  1   b1    1  from property 1 of  1   therefore  if condition  b  is satisfied  the system is stable.
¡¡the  only if  part is proved by contradiction  assuming the system is stable but any one or both the conditions do not hold. we omit details.	
corollary 1: consider n mobile agents with kinematics given by  1 . the agents will converge to a point if and only if not more than one of the agents  say agent p  has negative or zero controller gain bounded below by k¡¥p  i.e.  kp   k¡¥p and all other agents havewhere k¡¥p is given by
		 1 
proof. the proof follows directly from theorem 1.	
1 rendezvous
theorem 1  reachable point  if a system of n-agents have their initial positions at zi1 and gains  that satisfy theorem 1  then they converge to zf given by 
		 1 

figure 1: the reachable set  shaded region  for a group of agents in d = 1
where zf is a reachable point for this system of n agents.
proof. since system  1  is stable  all non-zero eigenvalues of a have negative real parts. therefore  as t ¡ú ¡Þ  the second term of  1  goes to zero and limt¡ú¡Þ xi t  = xf. this means that eventually the agent i converges to the point xf  given by  1   in the corresponding ¦Äth direction. thus  the rendezvous point in rd is obtained by replacing xf by the vector  yf1 ¡¤¡¤¡¤  yfd t in the corresponding d dimensions. 
¡¡now  let us denote zf zi1 k  as the reachable point obtained from the initial point zi1 and gain k that satisfies theorem 1. then the set of reachable points  called the reachable set   at which rendezvousoccurs starting from the initial point zi1  is denoted as zf zi1  and is defined as 
satisfying theorem 1
the agents can be made to converge to any desirable point within this reachableset by suitably selecting the gains. some examples of zf zi1  is given in figure 1 for d = 1.
1 directed motion
when the system  1  is not stable  we can obtain directed motion of the agents under certain condition. definition: the most positive eigenvalue of a linear system is the eigenvalue with the largest real part.
theorem 1 consider a system of n-agents with kinematics given by  1 . the trajectory of all the agents converge to a straight line as t ¡ú ¡Þ if and only if the most positive eigenvalue of  1  is real and positive.
proof. if the most positive eigenvalue is positive  then  1  is unstable. hence  the agents will not converge to a point. let the unit vector along the velocity vector of agent i at time t be  ¡úvi t  =  ¡¥vi t   1 vi1 t  vi1 t  ¡¤¡¤¡¤ vjd t  t where  vi¦Ä t  =
. if all the
agents have to converge to a straight line as t ¡ú ¡Þ  then
		 1 
the above equation can be rewritten for all i j ¡Ê {1 ... n} and for all ¦Ä ¦Ã ¡Ê {1 ... d} as t ¡ú ¡Þ  as follows
		 1 
where  ¦È¦Ã¦Ä is a constant independent of time and the agent identity. thus  to prove that the agents move in a straight line  we have to show that  1  is true. considering any one of the d-dimensions and differentiating  1   we get x¨bi t  as

let v = x¨b   then
	v¨b = x¡§ = ax¨b = av   v  1  = ax 1 	 1 
thus  v has the same dynamicsas  1  but with differentinitial conditions. the time response of the speed of the ith agent  vi t  can be obtained similar to  1  as

comparing  1  and  1  and matching the coefficients  we get
		 1 
where mpq k ¦Ç rp  is independent of the agent identity i.
¡¡now  the instantaneous slope of the trajectory of the agent i in the  ¦Ã ¦Ä  plane as t ¡ú ¡Þ can be simplified if ¦Øm = 1 ¦Òm ¡Ý ¦Òp  p is given by

let  it can be seen that with simple mathematical manipulations all the terms go to zero as except for p = m. now  if ¦Øm = 1  which implies that the most positive eigenvalue is real   the above equation simplifies to
		 1 
where  ¦È¦Ã¦Ä is independent of time and the agent identity i. it is a constant and a function of ki i = 1 ¡¤¡¤¡¤  n  and the initial positions of the agents zi1  i. now  following a similar procedure  we have
		 1 
therefore  as. hence   is on the straight line along which the agents motion
converges as t ¡ú ¡Þ.
now  to prove the converse  let  then

from the above  we see that if  the agents will not converge to a straight line.	
remark 1: the straight line asymptote of the trajectories  after sufficiently large time  passes through zf = which is called the asymptote point.
remark 1: when  the agents do not converge to a straight line. however  the direction in which the ith agent moves  after a sufficiently large t  can be calculated from  1 . remark 1: even though the agents converge to a straight line  the direction of motion of the agents need not be the same. in fact  if the gain of only one agent is negative  all the agents movein the same direction  otherwise they movein two opposite directions along the straight line. the direction in which an agent i will move is determined from the sign of the coefficient  aiprq with p = m q = 1 r = np of xi t  in  1 .
1 general pursuit sequence and switching invariance results
in the problem formulation  we have assumed a particular sequence in which an agent pursues another. we now show that even where the connection  or more generally  the pursuit sequence  among the agents is changed  certain properties of the system remain unchanged. this is important in certain applications where the connectivity or the trajectory have to be changed during the process due to some constraints  without changing the goal.
definition: let the set of all pursuit sequences be q and ¦Çi ¦Çj ¡Ê q be two pursuit sequences. when there is a change in the pursuit sequence of the agents from ¦Çi to ¦Çj  it is called switching. if switching occurs a finite number of times during the process  then we call it a finite switching case.
theorem 1 the stability of the linear cyclic pursuit is pursuit sequence invariant.
proof. the stability of  1  depends on the roots of ¦Ñ s  = 1. as long as there is a cyclic pursuit among the agents  ¦Ñ s  remains unchangedeven when the pursuit sequence is different. thus  stability of the system is pursuit sequence invariant. 
theorem 1 the reachable point of a stable linear cyclic pursuit is pursuit sequence invariant.
proof. consider  1   which gives the coordinates of the rendezvous point. this equation is independent of the sequence of connection among the agents. hence  the rendezvous point is independent of the connectivity of the agents. 
theorem 1 the asymptote point of an unstable linear cyclic pursuit system  satisfying theorem 1  is pursuit sequence invariant.
proof. for the agent i  as t ¡ú ¡Þ  the unit velocity vector can be written using  1  as ¦Ôi t  =  vi1/v¡¥i  1  ¦È1  ¦È1  ...  ¦È1d t  1 
since  depends on the connection of the agents  the unit velocity vector changes as the connection is changed. this implies that for different connections  the asymptote to which the agents converge is different. however  from  1   it can be seen that all the asymptotes pass

figure 1: the trajectories of a stable system of 1 agents with all positive gains.
through the point zf  the asymptote point   which is independent of the connection. in other words  all the asymptotes radiate from zf  but their direction depends on the connection between the agents.	
¡¡the pursuit sequence invariance property discussed so far is based on the assumption that the pursuit sequence between the agents remained constant throughouttime. now  we show that even if the pursuit sequence between the agents change during the process  some of the properties remain unchanged.
¡¡corollaries given below follows directly from the above theorems.
corollary 1:  stability  the stability of the linear cyclic pursuit is invariant under finite pursuit sequence switching. corollary 1: reachability with switching  the reachable point of a stable linear cyclic pursuit system is invariant with finite pursuit sequence switching.
corollary 1: directed motion with switching  the asymptote point of an unstable linear cyclic pursuit system  satisfying theorem 1  is invariant with finite pursuit sequence switching.
¡¡note that the trajectory of the agents may change due to switching but the stability  reachable point and the asymptote point are not changed.
1 simulation results
a system of 1 agents are considered in r1. the initial positions of the agents are s =   1 1   1 1   1 1    1 1   1 1  . the pursuit sequences considered in these simulations are ¦Ç1 =  1 1 1 1   ¦Ç1 =  1 1 1 1  and ¦Ç1 =  1 1 . different sets of gains are selected arbitrarily for simulation to illustrate the results obtained in this paper. we assume that the agents know the gains and pursuit sequences.
case 1: the pursuit sequence of the agents is ¦Ç1 and k =  1  1  1  1  1  which satisfies theorem 1. the trajectories of agents are shown in figure 1. the system is stable. the agents converge to zf =  1 1 1 t which satisfies  1 . case 1: pursuit sequence is ¦Ç1 and k =  1  1  1  1  1 . this set of gains satisfy theorem 1. the agents converge at z1  =  1 1 t as shown in fig. 1.
case 1: the pursuit sequence is ¦Ç1 and k =  1  1  1  1    1 . here  k¡¥1 =  1 and according to theorem 1  this system is stable  fig. 1 . the agents converge at zf =  1  1  1 t and satisfies  1 . case 1: pursuit sequence is ¦Ç1. and k =  1  1   1  1   1  are considered  keeping the same pursuit sequence ¦Ç1. this

system is unstable as it violates theorem 1. the eigenvalues of this system are {1  1    1    1    1} . it can be seen that the most positive eigenvalue is positive satisfying theorem 1 and the agents converge to a straight line as can be seen in figure 1. moreover  we can see that some agents move in one direction while the others in the opposite direction.
case	1:	the	pursuit	sequence	is	¦Ç1 and	k	=  1  1  1  1 	and	.	the	gains	do	not	satisfy	theorem	1.	the	eigenvalues	are	{1 ¡À j1 1  1  1}.	since the most positive eigenvalue is not real  the agents will not converge to a straight line. this can be seen in figure 1  where we can see that the direction of motion of the agents varies with time.
case 1: the switching invariance of the reachable point is shown in figure 1 for the system with gains k =  1  1  1  1  1  and the pursuit sequence of ¦Ç1  ¦Ç1 and ¦Ç1  in this sequence. the dotted line shows the trajectory if there was no switching. it can be seen from the figure that the reachable point is remains unchange for finite number of switching.

the asymptote point. the gains considered are k =  1  1  1  1    1   which satisfy theorem 1. the pursuit sequence switches from ¦Ç1 to ¦Ç1 to ¦Ç1. the trajectories are shown in figure 1. we see that even with switching  the asymptote point remains the same.
case 1: a swarm of 1 agents are considered to show the scalability of generalized centroidal cyclic pursuit. the initial positions of the agents are chosen randomly. the gains of the agents are positive and the pursuit sequence is selected arbitrarily. fig 1 shows the rendezvousof the swarm of agents.

cyclic pursuit strategies have recently been of much interest among researchers in swarm intelligence. in this paper  we generalize the concept of cyclic pursuit in which an agent pursues a weighted average of the remaining agents. the system of agents using generalized centroidal cyclic pursuit is analyzed. the set of controller gains are determined for which the system will remain stable. if the system is stable  all the agents converge to a point. the rendezvous point is

obtained as a function of the gains and the initial positions. if the system is unstable  we found the condition under which the agents demonstrate directed linear motion. an interesting result shown here is that the stability  rendezvous point and the asymptote of the directed motion are all invariant to pursuit sequence and switching.
