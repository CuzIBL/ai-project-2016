 in this paper the application of some deep theorems of mathematical logic is shown in the f i e l d of a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i gence. namely  using some of the results of definition theory we give the mathema t i c a l base to systems for automatic designing. /sad/  these systems are capable 
of solving constructive tasks of such kind that need some creativity from the psychological point of view. above tasks contain the i m t l i c i t e description of the object to be contructed. f i r s t of a l l that unit is investigated at sad which provides an explicit definition to the circumscribed object. 
             introduction one of the main directions in research of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence is developing problem solving systems namely  systems for automatic designing /sad/  their practical importance is invaluable. these systems are capable to solve constructive 
tasks  a task is constructive if the unknown is some kind of an object of which characteristics are described in the conditions of the ta1k. two kinds of these are distinguished: 
1. the objects to be constructed are defined e x p l i c i t l y : a/ well-defined task b/ incompletely defined task - here the 
conditions provide an incomplete description of the object 
1. the objects to be constructed are defined i m p l i c i t l y . 
in these take the objects are not named only certain expectations are given about them. 
designing tasks appearing on the expectations of a non-professional customer 
belong to l a t t e r type. it can't be expected from him to give an explicit definition of a required program e.g. with the i n put-output relation. a l l he can do is to give some hints on his own expectations towards some  programlike  thing. similar problems occur at decision making where information is i m p l i c i t l y connected with the question to be decided about. 
a sad capable of solving the 1econd type constructive task  must consist of the following two basic oomponents: 
1. high-level problem defining unit which provides an explicit definition to the implicit object description 
1. solving unit which carries out the e x p l i c i t l y defined task 
mathematical logic and i t s model theory provides plenty of f a c i l i t i e s in sad research. in our present study we i n t r o duce the usefulness of definition theory  an intensively developing f i l e d of modeltheory  from the point of view of sad. 
basic definitions 
the following t r i p l e form a language: 
  syntax  the set of possible worlds  v a l i d i t y     or formally l = f  m  f   . 
a 	type t is a pair of functions  i.e. 

set. 
mere dot and rgt are the domain and the range of t respectively. dot' is the set of relation symbols and dot  is the set of function symbols. 
in the followings we suppose that a t-type first-order langugage 

1 

is given. here  is the set of t-type structures.  t-type structure  is a function for which 

aboves are to be found in more details in  notations of common knowledge are also to be found there. 
prom now on when program is being discussed relation symbols w i l l be used in describing the camputer programs where such symbols may show what relation the input-output should have. this descriptive method provides a far more natural handling of the programs than the descriptions of programs by functions  since this approach is more close to the i n t u i t i o n of the non-programer customers. 
intuitive description of sad based on the definition theory 
let  be a set of first-order formulas which provides the knowledge of a discripline within that designing w i l l occur. s.e.p p provides the semantics of a programing language and the properties of different implemented programs. 
the customer give1 hi1 requests with the help of a set of formulas  . this i m p l i c i t l y defines one or more relation symbols and/or function symbols which do not occur in dot' u dot  . in the followings without l i m i t i n g generality  we supposec that gives the implicit definition of only one relation symbol  p. e.g. .  gives the implicit definition of such a program of which input and output are in relation p. let denote the set of formulas defining the relation p i m p l i c i t l y .

le 	extension 	o f 	the 
type be the syntax of the 
first-order language extended by relation 
p. thus 
t carry out the design of the required object we have to give i t s explicit description by a formula of   f . bo as to have the required program written in our programing language we have to find such a formula from f which defines v e x p l i c i t l y . 

what is the task of a high-level problem 
defining unit supposed to be at sad  it has to find a definition  on the base of  knowledge to the requested expecta-

if the answer to question 1. is negative then the knowledge within the disciplines 
defined by is 	not enough for the explicit description of the required object. 
on the basis of aboves a  high-level  
1 

problem defining unit of sad should operate the following way. 
the basic knowledge of sad is provided by set of formulas   the customer gives his required object description by the help of set of formulas as a f i r s t step the unit has to find an exact answer for the existence of   but since it ic to complicated a task the following way is chosen. firsb the system controls whether contradicts to knowledge   i.e. it t r i e s to deduce the identically false from . 
if this doesn't suceed within a present time period then the system presupposes the existence of a formula and it w i l l proceed onto the 1. task  i . e . producing 
let us suppose that we succeeded in producing such a formula. 	it 	is followed by t i s trying: 
if really becomes 
the requirements of the customer if not  then it may be supposed that the knowledge of the sad is not satisfactory for defining . therefore has to be extended t i l l and aboves have to be repeated nov; for set of formulas the system w i l l go on with this either u n t i l it proves the impossibility of on the basis of the extended set of formulas or  it succeeds to produce formula   of course the system goes on with trying only for a fixed time. w'e note that the extension of set of formulas need inductive logical means from the system. 
now we shall see that case when defines v only up to the disjunction  
the so obtained formulas have to be controlled one by one. so this control goes on u n t i l the f i r s t for which    if neither 
satisfies above condition then it might be supposed that the knowledge  is not satisfactory. in this case the prodecure goe1 on similarly  i.e.  is extended u n t i l   etc. 
useful theorems of definition theory 
in this chapter we introduce those theorems of definition theory without proof which provide the explicit definition of p on the basis of  and    their proofs can be found in . it is expected to obtain different types of theorems depending on the strenght of 
 v/'e begin with the theory containing the weakest conditions for 
if  and a model 	is given then 
the conditions of the theorems contain either that how many relations 
are there for which ; or that how many such relations are there to such a relation so as 
1.theorem /chang - makkai theorem/. if 
of 
then there are a f i n i t e number of para-

circumscribes the relation p in some 
measure then there exists a parameter-
- v e c formulas such that one of them gives the definition 

of p. in other words the set of formulas defines p e x p l i c i t l y up to para-
meters and disjunction.

theorem 	is 
is 
 then there exists a f i n i t e number of first-order parametric formulas 
the intuitive meaning of 	the theorem is as it follows: if the number of 
relations satisfying set of formulas  is less than the number of a l l 
possible relations then up to disjunction  parametrically defines relation p. the condition of the theorems claims that not a l l the possible relations should carry the characteristics described by the set of formulas 
above theorems /theorems 1. and 1./ are true also for that case when the number of the suitable relations is less than 
not    b u t i . e . in this case there exists a f i n i t e number of f i r s t -order parametric formula and such a parametervector that one of the formulas w i l l give the definition of relation p by the suitable parametervector. 
theorem 1 . is such that in every model is 
		then the statement of the 
previous theorem is true# 
i n t u i t i v e l y the above theorems /theorems 1. and 1 . / state the following: if is such that i t s required characteristics arc f u l f i l l e d in every model by at least f i n i t e number of relations then there exists such a formula for calculating parameters and there exist formulas out of v/hich one defines relation p by the parameters determined by 
fron the point of view of sad this means that a theorem prover extended by inductive elements can prove  that 

on the basis of thin proof a zero-order muct bo selected so 
	that 	.after this it has 
to be proved  that 
then on the basis of knowledge we select the suitable defining formula

in these theorems similarly to theorems 
1. and 1. the formulas  and the formula 		serve to 	define the parametervector. the definition of r e l a t ion 1 is 	done also on the basis of those described after theorem 1- there is a difference only when definition is done on the basis of theorem 1  because here we have to try out the formulas not only according 	tt 	also according to   
 the conditions of theorems 1. and 1. for  are so much stronger than those of theorems 1. and 1. that now we claim the existence of such a f i n i t e k which is upper-bound of the number of suitable relations in each model. 
the  is t e strongest in that case if this conditions are satisfied in each model by at least one relation. now we discuss those theorems which refer to t h i s . 
theorem 1. /svenonius' theorem/: if for 
in 	f 
i n t u i t i v e l y it means that if we take two extensions 	and 	of any 	model 	so that these become models of and these are isomorphic then 
  
in this case the set of formulas defines relation p up to disjunction. 
1. /beth'a theorem/: if the set is such that for each 
                 conclusion as we could see from aboves the model theory provides mathematical bases suitable for the development of different kinds of sad important in the practice. this is expecially important because to construct i m p l i c i t l y described objects from psichological point of view is a task demanding creativity. the degree of creativity partly depends on the circumscription of the required object and partly on the development of the corresponding discipline. with the help of the theorems of different strength described in aboves we can obtain different sad-s of different degree of creativity. so far we can see that the research of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence requires the application of deep mathematical results of mathematical logic. to make sad more effective we need the following problem to be solved: and are given then what conditions should satisfy so as to have a formula existing for which
