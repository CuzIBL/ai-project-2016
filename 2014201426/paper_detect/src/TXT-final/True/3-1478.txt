1 introduction
belief revision is a central topic in databases  philosophy and artificial intelligence. the revision of a database consists of the insertion of some new information while preserving consistency.
¡¡this process has been discussed in different frameworks  probability theory  spohn's ordinal conditional functions  grove's systems of spheres  possibility theory  etc.  and from different points of view  axiomatization  alchourro¡än et al.  1; katsuno and mendelzon  1   computational issue  etc. . the proposal of alchourro¡än  ga¡§rdenfors and makinson  agm   alchourro¡än et al.  1  represents one of the most influential work. it concerns revision operations that revise a theory  representing agent's current beliefs  with a formula  representing new pieces of information . the agm framework consists in a set of natural postulates that any revision operation should satisfy.
¡¡an important issue is that any revision operator satisfying agm's postulates is implicitly based on a priority ordering. this result suggests that an agent's epistemic state  denoted by ¦·  is something more complex than a simple representation of agent's current beliefs  called belief set and denoted by bel ¦·  . it also contains strategies to revise his beliefs. the agm's postulates have been largely studied and/or adapted in the literature. for instance  additional postulates have been proposed to manage the concept of iterated belief change in  darwiche and pearl  1   see also  rott  1;
lehmann  1; nayak  1; konieczny and pino pe¡ärez  1  . more generally  iterated revision is applied to an epistemic state  instead of a belief set  and the result is also an epistemic state.
¡¡epistemic states are often represented by total pre-orders on possible worlds  or interpretations   denoted by ¡Ü¦·. the set of models of bel ¦·  are identified to be minimal  i.e  preferred  elements with respect to ¡Ü¦·.
¡¡there is another issue in belief revision and which has been less investigated in the literature: the iterated revision of epistemic states represented by partial pre-orders  instead of total pre-orders   katsuno and mendelzon  1 . partial preorders offer more flexibility than total pre-orders to represent incomplete knowledge.
¡¡katsuno and mendelzon proposed in section 1 of  katsuno and mendelzon  1   a set of postulates and a representation theorem that characterize revision operations based on partial pre-orders. unfortunately  the proposed approach is not satisfactory since only one class of partial pre-orders can be revised. for instance  assume that we have a partial preorder ¦· on four possible interpretations {¦Ø1 ¦Ø1 ¦Ø1 ¦Ø1}  such that ¦Ø1 is  strictly preferred  to ¦Ø1 and ¦Ø1 is  strictly preferred  to ¦Ø1 but ¦Ø1 is incomparable with ¦Ø1  ¦Ø1 and ¦Ø1  cf. figure 1  for sake of clarity  reflexivity and transitivity are not represented . clearly  ¦Ø1 and ¦Ø1 characterize  are models of  agent's currents beliefs bel ¦·   no interpretation is strictly preferred to is not a faithful assignment in the sense of  katsuno and mendelzon  1 .
¡¡more generally  there is no consistent propositional formula that admits ¦· of figure 1 as a faithful assignment. in
		¦Ø1
¦Ø1
figure 1: example of ¦· which is not a faithful assignment.
fact  faithful assignment requires that each model of agent's current beliefs  namely bel ¦·   should be strictly preferred to each counter-model of agent's current beliefs. this requirement is appropriate for total pre-orders  but is too strong for partial pre-orders.
¡¡this paper investigates iterated belief revision of partially ordered information. its main contributions can be summarized as follows:
  we propose an alternative definition of faithful assignment and an alternative set of natural postulates for revising partially ordered information.
  we provide a representation theorem for iterated revision operators satisfying this new set of postulates.
  we investigate additionalpostulates dedicated to iterated belief revision. in particular  we discuss the extension of darwiche and pearl's postulates  boutilier's postulate and we propose two alternative postulates for capturing other forms of iterated belief revision.
  lastly  we illustrate our results with three well-known operators  revision with memory  possibilistic revision and natural belief revision  for revising partially ordered information.
¡¡the rest of this paper is organized as follows. section 1 presents the katsuno and mendelzon's postulates for belief revision. section 1 contains a modification of these postulates. section 1 characterizes darwiche and pearl's postulates and boutilier's postulate for iterated belief revision with partially ordered information. lastly  section 1 proposes two alternative additional postulates and provides three examples of operators that satisfy the proposed postulates.
1 notations and km postulates
1 notations
in this paper we use propositional calculus  denoted by l  as knowledge representation language with usual connectives    ¡Ä  ¡Å  ¡ú  ¡Ô  logical equivalence . the lower case letters a  b  c  ¡¤¡¤¡¤  are used to denote propositional variables and lower case greeks letters    ¦×  ¡¤¡¤¡¤  are used to denote formulas. we denote by   the set of interpretations of l and by mod ¦×  the set of models of a formula ¦×  that is mod ¦×  = {¦Ø ¡Ê   ¦Ø |= ¦×}. upper case greeks letters ¦·  ¦µ ¡¤¡¤¡¤  are used to denote epistemic states.
¡¡a partial pre-order  denoted by is a reflexive and transitive binary relation. let x y ¡Ê a  we define the equality. the corresponding strict partial pre-order associated with   denoted by    is defined as usual: holds but does not hold. we denote by ¡« the incomparability relation  namely x ¡« y iff neitherholds.
given  the set of the minimal elements of a 
  is defined by  :
¡Ê	.
1 the km postulates for belief revision katsuno and mendelzon proposed in  katsuno and mendelzon  1  a reformalization of the well-known agm postulates  alchourro¡än et al.  1 . in this framework  the epistemic state of an agent is represented by a formula ¦×. a revision operator   is a function from a formula ¦× and produces a new formula denoted by ¦×   ¦Ì. the operator   should satisfy the following postulates.
 r1  ¦×   ¦Ì |= ¦Ì 
 r1  if ¦× ¡Ä ¦Ì is satisfiable  then ¦×   ¦Ì ¡Ô ¦× ¡Ä ¦Ì 
 r1  if ¦Ì is satisfiable  then ¦×   ¦Ì is satisfiable 
 r1  if ¦×1 ¡Ô ¦×1 and ¦Ì1 ¡Ô ¦Ì1 then ¦×1   ¦Ì1 ¡Ô ¦×1   ¦Ì1 
 r1   ¦×   ¦Ì  ¡Ä   |= ¦×    ¦Ì ¡Ä    
 r1  if  ¦× ¦Ì ¡Ä  is satisfiable  then ¦×  ¦Ì¡Ä   |=  ¦× ¦Ì ¡Ä . an important result is that any revision operator that satisfies  r1     r1  is implicitly based a total pre-order ¡Ü¦× on
 .
¡¡in order to deal with partial pre-orders  katsuno and mendelzon proposed in section 1 of  katsuno and mendelzon  1  to replace  r1  by the two following postulates:
 r1  if ¦×   ¦Ì1 |= ¦Ì1 and ¦×   ¦Ì1 |= ¦Ì1 then ¦×   ¦Ì1 ¡Ô ¦×   ¦Ì1 
 r1   ¦×   ¦Ì1  ¡Ä  ¦×   ¦Ì1  |= ¦×    ¦Ì1 ¡Å ¦Ì1 .
¡¡the following representation theorem has been proposed with these postulates for partial pre-orders.
theorem 1   katsuno and mendelzon  1   a revision operator   satisfies the postulates  r1  to  r1    r1  and  r1  iff there exists a faithful assignment that maps ¦× to a partial pre-order ¦× such that:
.
where the faithful assignment is defined as follows.
definition 1  faithful assignment  let ¦× be a propositional formula. a partial pre-order on    associated with ¦×  denoted by ¦×  is said to be a faithful assignment if the three following conditions hold :
 1  if ¦Ø ¦Ø1 ¡Ê mod ¦×  then ¦Ø  ¦× ¦Ø1 does not hold   1  if ¦Ø ¡Ê mod ¦×  and ¦Ø1 ¡Ê/ mod ¦×   then ¦Ø  ¦× ¦Ø1 holds 
 1  if ¦× ¡Ô    then ¡Ü¦×=¡Ü . in the following  by km postulates  we refer to  r1     r1    r1  and  r1 .
1 km postulates revisited
in the introduction  we pointed out that km postulates are not fully satisfactory for iterated belief revision of partially ordered information. this section justifies this statement and proposes a revisited set of km postulates.
1 faithful assignment revisited
 this subsection proposes a modified definition of faithful assignment. the one given by definition 1 is not appropriate. indeed  if ¦· is a partial pre-order on the set of interpretations   representing agent's epistemic state  and if we define  to be the current agent's be-
liefs  then there is no guarantee that ¦· will be a faithful assignment.
¡¡for instance  the partial pre-order given by figure 1 is not a faithful assignment  since condition  1  of definition 1 is not satisfied. indeed mod bel ¦·   = {¦Ø1 ¦Ø1} and ¦Ø1  ¦· ¦Ø1 does not hold. of course  one may simply suggest to enforce minimal elements of ¦· to be equal. in our example  we enforce ¦Ø1 to be equal to ¦Ø1  as it is illustrated by figure 1 .
¦Ø1 ¦Ø1
¦Ø1 =¦·1 ¦Ø1
figure 1: example of.
¡¡but this is not satisfactory. indeed  if  denotes the partial pre-order obtained from ¦· by enforcing minimal elements  be equal then  in general  bel ¦·1   ¦Ì  ¡Ô1 bel ¦·   ¦Ì . in our example  if we consider a new piece of information ¦Ì such that mod ¦Ì  = {¦Ø1 ¦Ø1}  then  it can easily be checked that bel ¦·   ¦Ì  1¡Ô bel ¦·1   ¦Ì . indeed
and
 
 are respectively represented by figure 1 and figure 1.
¡¡the problem with definition 1 is the condition  1   which requires that each model of agent's current beliefs is preferred to all counter-models of agent's current beliefs. we propose to weaken this condition by only requiring that each countermodel of agent's current beliefs is strictly less preferred than at least one model of agent's current beliefs.
¡¡in order to deal with iterated belief revision  which applies to epistemic states instead of formulas  we also modify condition  1  exactly as it is proposed in  darwiche and pearl  1 . these two changes lead to the following modified definition of faithful assignment.
definition 1  p-faithful assignment  let ¦· be an epistemic state. a partial pre-order on    associated to ¦· and denoted by ¦· is said to be a p-faithful assignment if the three following conditions hold :
 1  if ¦Ø ¦Ø1 |= bel ¦·  then ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ø1 does not hold 
 1  if ¦Ø1|= bel ¦·   then there exists ¦Ø such that ¦Ø |= bel ¦·  and ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ø1 
 1  if ¦· = ¦µ  then.
¡¡clearly  if ¦· is a faithful assignment  then it is also a pfaithful assignment. note that if ¦· is a total pre-order  then this definition is equivalent to the definition of a faithful assignment of darwiche and pearl  darwiche and pearl  1 .
1 revisited postulates for partially ordered information
let us now present the  revision  of km postulates. in the whole paper  we assume that the new information ¦Ì is consistent and the initial beliefs mod bel ¦·  is not empty. basically  there is a need of two changes. the first change is the same as the one proposed by darwiche and pearl in  darwiche and pearl  1   see also  friedman and halpern  1  . it consists in a simple adaptation of km postulates in order to make belief revision operation a function on epistemic states instead on set of beliefs. more precisely  we propose to replace postulate  r1  by the one proposed in  darwiche and pearl  1 .
 p1  if ¦·1 = ¦·1 and ¦Ì1 ¡Ô ¦Ì1 then bel ¦·1   ¦Ì1  ¡Ô
bel ¦·1   ¦Ì1 .
¡¡postulate  p1  requires the equality between epistemic states while r1 requires the equivalence between beliefs sets. the second change concerns postulate  r1 . we argue that  r1  is too strong when dealing with partial pre-orders.
¡¡let us consider again the example represented by figure 1. let ¦Ì be such that mod ¦Ì  = {¦Ø1 ¦Ø1}. since
  we expect to have bel ¦·  ¦Ì  ¡Ô {¦Ø1 ¦Ø1}. but r1 leads to have bel ¦·   ¦Ì  ¡Ô {¦Ø1}. indeed   r1  says that if bel ¦·  ¡Ä ¦Ì is consistent  then bel ¦·    ¦Ì ¡Ô bel ¦·  ¡Ä ¦Ì. this equivalence makes sense if for each ¦Ø ¦Ø1 models of bel ¦·   ¦Ø =¦· ¦Ø1 holds. however  when models of bel ¦·  may be incomparable  then  r1  becomes questionable.
¡¡we suggest to replace r1 by the following postulate. it concerns the situation where the new piece of information is a tautology. in this case  agent's current beliefs should not change. namely:
 p1  bel ¦·      ¡Ô bel ¦· .
1 representation theorem
the new set of postulates that we propose for characterizing the revision of partially ordered beliefs are the following ones.
 p1  bel ¦·   ¦Ì  |= ¦Ì 
 p1  bel ¦·      ¡Ô bel ¦·  
 p1  if ¦Ì is satisfiable  then bel ¦·   ¦Ì  is satisfiable 
and ¦Ì1 ¡Ô ¦Ì1 then bel ¦·1   ¦Ì1  ¡Ô
 
 p1  bel ¦·   ¦Ì  ¡Ä   |= bel ¦·    ¦Ì ¡Ä     
 p1  if bel ¦·   ¦Ì1  |= ¦Ì1 and bel ¦·   ¦Ì1  |= ¦Ì1 then
bel ¦·   ¦Ì1  ¡Ô bel ¦·   ¦Ì1  
 p1  bel ¦·   ¦Ì1  ¡Ä bel ¦·   ¦Ì1  |= bel ¦·    ¦Ì1 ¡Å ¦Ì1  .
¡¡the postulates  p1    p1    p1    p1   correspond respectively to the postulates  r1   r1    r1    r1 . the postulates  p1  and  p1  are respectively a reformalization of the postulates  r1  and  r1  proposed in  katsuno and mendelzon  1  for epistemic states.
¡¡two weakenings of  r1  can be derived from this set of postulates:
 
 p1w  if bel ¦·  |= ¦Ì then bel ¦·   ¦Ì  ¡Ô bel ¦·  ¡Ä ¦Ì.
¡¡the first one means that joint of initial beliefs bel ¦·  and the new information are contained in the set of new belief's models. the second one means that if we revise with some pieces of informationthat can be inferredfrom agent's current beliefs  then the agent's beliefs should not change.
¡¡given this set of postulates and the definition of p-faithful assignment  we provide the following representation theorem:
theorem 1 a revision operator   satisfies the postulates
 p1  to  p1  iff there exists a p-faithful assignment that maps pre-order ¦· such that mod bel ¦·  
   =	 	     ¦· .
1 characterization of iterated revision postulates
several authors  e.g.  darwiche and pearl  1   argue that  in order to have a genuine iterated belief revision operator  we should augment basic agm postulates with some additional postulates. indeed  these basic postulates constrain the relationships between bel ¦·  and bel ¦· ¦Ì . the aim of these additional postulates is to provide more constraints between ¦· and ¦·   ¦Ì by  for instance  expliciting the relationships between. given a formula ¦Ì  there are three questions that need to be addressed:
  how the order between models of ¦Ì does evolve 
  how the order between counter-models of ¦Ì does evolve    how the order between models and counter-models of ¦Ì does evolve 
¡¡darwiche and pearl  darwiche and pearl  1  gave four natural postulates for iterated belief revision that provide answers for these questions.
 c1  if ¦Á |= ¦Ì  then bel  ¦·   ¦Ì    ¦Á  ¡Ô bel ¦·   ¦Á  
 c1  if ¦Á |=  ¦Ì  then bel  ¦·   ¦Ì    ¦Á  ¡Ô bel ¦·   ¦Á  
 c1  if bel ¦·   ¦Á  |= ¦Ì  then bel  ¦·   ¦Ì    ¦Á  |= ¦Ì 
 c1  if bel ¦·   ¦Á  1|=  ¦Ì  then bel  ¦·   ¦Ì    ¦Á  |1=  ¦Ì.
¡¡another postulate  which has also been discussed in the literature  is the one which characterizes boutilier's natural belief revision  boutilier  1  and hinted in  spohn  1   for totally ordered beliefs:
 cb  if bel ¦· ¦Ì  |=  ¦Á then bel  ¦· ¦Ì  ¦Á  ¡Ô bel ¦·
¦Á .
¡¡this section provides a characterization of the darwiche and pearl's postulates and the boutilier's postulate  when epistemic states are represented by partial pre-orders.
¡¡in the following  we restrict ourselves to iterated belief revision operators that satisfy  p1   p1 . let   be a such revision operator and ¦· be its associated p-faithful assignment. in order to characterize  c1   c1  and  cb   we define five properties on relationships between.
 ip1  if ¦Ø |= ¦Ì and ¦Ø1 |= ¦Ì then ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ø1 iff ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ì ¦Ø1   ip1  if ¦Ø 1|= ¦Ì and ¦Ø1|= ¦Ì then ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ø1 iff ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ì ¦Ø1 
implies ¦Ø ¦· ¦Ì
¦Ø1
implies
 ip1  if ¦Ø ¦Ø1|= bel ¦·   ¦Ì  then ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ø1 implies ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ì ¦Ø1.
¡¡ ip1   resp.  ip1   means that the strict order between models  resp. counter-models  of the new piece of information ¦Ì is preserved.  ip1  means that if a model of ¦Ì is strictly preferred to a counter-models then this strict preference is preserved.  ip1  is similar with  ip1  for non-strict preference. finally   ip1  means that the strict order between the counter-models of the agent's current beliefs is preserved. the following representation theorem provides a characterization of  c1     c1 . theorem 1 let   be a revision operator satisfying the postulates  p1     p1 . then:
 1    satisfies  c1  iff its associated faithful assignment satisfies  ip1    1    satisfies  c1  iff its associated faithful assignment satisfies  ip1  
 1    satisfies  c1  iff its associated faithful assignment satisfies  ip1  
¡¡note that only the characterization of  c1  is identical to the one providedby darwiche and pearl  darwiche and pearl  1 . the others are different.
¡¡more precisely  there are two main differences with the dp representation theorem. first  we have only  1  if the faithful assignment associated with   satisfies  ip1  then   satisfies  c1 .
the converse does not hold.
¡¡the second main difference concerns  c1  and  c1 . indeed  darwiche and pearl have shown that when tal pre-order  then  c1   resp.  c1   guarantees  to be identical on their subdomain mod ¦Ì ¡Ámod ¦Ì 
 resp. mod  ¦Ì  ¡Á mod  ¦Ì  . however  when ¦· is a partial pre-order  then only the strict relations  ¦· and  ¦· ¦Ì are identical. namely  it may happen that ¦Ø =¦· ¦Ø1 and ¦Ø ¡«¦· ¦Ì ¦Ø1 both hold for revision operator satisfying  p1    p1  and  resp.  c1  .
a similar remark also holds for boutilier's postulate  cb .
theorem 1 let   be a revision operator satisfying the postulates  p1     p1 . then:
  satisfies  cb  iff   satisfies  ip1 .
¡¡when ¦· is a total pre-order  then  ¦· ¦Ì is uniquely defined for satisfying  cb . theorem 1 shows that the unicity of the result is no longer valid and hence is not uniquely defined. again  only the strict relation associated with is uniquely defined.
¡¡an example of revision operator satisfying  cb  is an extension to  natural revision  for partial pre-orders:
definition 1 let ¦· be an epistemic state and ¦Ì be a propositional formula  the revised epistemic state ¦· n¦Ì corresponds to the following partial pre-order:
 then iff
 
 then iff
 
	and	¦Ø1¡Ê
.
¡¡the first condition imposes that the order between the preferred models of ¦Ì is preserved. the second condition preserves the ordering between non-preferred models of ¦Ì. finally  the third condition imposes that any minimal models of ¦Ì is preferred to any other model.
example 1 let us consider the epistemic state ¦· represented by figure 1  where ¦Ø1 = { a  b}  ¦Ø1 = {a  b}  ¦Ø1 = { a b}  ¦Ø1 = {a b}. let ¦Ì be a new piece of information such that mod ¦Ì  = {¦Ø1 ¦Ø1}. then the revision of ¦· by the new piece of information ¦Ì is represented by the partial pre-orderdescribed by figure 1.
¦Ø1	¦Ø1 ¦Ø1
	¦Ø1	¦Ø1
	¦Ø1	¦Ø1 ¡Ö ¦Ø1
	figure 1: ¦·	figure 1:
¡¡according to this definition it can be checked that the revision operator  n provided by definition 1 satisfies the postulates  p1     p1  and  cb . moreover  it can be noticed that  n does not satisfy  r1  since mod bel ¦·   = {¦Ø1 ¦Ø1}  mod bel ¦·   n ¦Ì  = {¦Ø1 ¦Ø1} and mod bel ¦·  ¡Ä ¦Ì  =
{¦Ø1}.
1 two alternative postulates
among additional postulates  c1     c1  proposed in  darwiche and pearl  1  for iterated belief revision   c1  seems to be very acceptable. however it is less obvious with  c1   for more detailed discussion  see  for instance 
 lehmann  1; friedman and halpern  1  . moreover   c1  may appear to be too cautious. we now propose to analyze two alternative postulates which capture two other forms of iterated belief revision.
¡¡the first one departs from the idea of  c1   and it is close to the idea of conditioning with a completely sure information used in uncertainty theories. in probability theory  and similarly in possibility theory   if we revise a probability distribution by some completely sure formula  then all counter-models of these formulas are considered as impossible. this properties is captured by the following postulate.
 ccond  bel  ¦·   ¦Ì     ¦Ì  ¡Ô  ¦Ì.
¡¡it expresses that if ¦· is revised by ¦Ì  and again by its contrary  ¦Ì  then piece of initial beliefs are ignored  and only last pieces of information are retained. the characterization of this postulate is as follows.
theorem 1 a revision operator   satisfies the postulates
 p1     p1  and  ccond  iff its corresponding p-faithful assignment leads to  which is such that if ¦Ø |=  ¦Ì and ¦Ø1 |=  ¦Ì then neither ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ì ¦Ø1  nor ¦Ø1  ¦· ¦Ì ¦Ø holds.
¡¡we illustrate this postulate by the following definition of the extension of qualitative possibilistic revision  dubois and prade  1 .
definition 1 let ¦· be an epistemic state such that its corresponding p-faithful assignment leads to ¦·. let ¦Ì be a propositional formula  the revised epistemic state ¦·  ¦Ð ¦Ì is defined by:
 
  if ¦Ø  ¦Ø1¡Ê mod ¦Ì  then ¦Ø =¦· ¦Ð¦Ì ¦Ø1 
  if ¦Ø ¡Ê mod ¦Ì  and ¦Ø1¡Ê mod ¦Ì  then ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ð¦Ì ¦Ø1.
¡¡ are identical on subdomain mod ¦Ì  ¡Á mod ¦Ì . each models of ¦Ì are preferred to each counter-models of ¦Ì. and lastly  the counter-models of ¦Ì are considered equally preferred.
example 1 let us again consider the epistemic state ¦· represented by figure 1. let ¦Ì be a new information such that
mod ¦Ì  = {¦Ø1 ¦Ø1}. then  the revision of ¦· by the new information ¦Ì is represented by the partial pre-order described by figure 1
¦Ø1 =¦· ¦Ð¦Ì ¦Ø1

	¦Ø1	¦Ø1
figure 1:
¡¡according to this definition it can be checked that the revision operator  ¦Ð provided by definition 1 satisfies the postulates  p1     p1    c1   c1     c1  and  ccond .
¡¡the second postulate concerns relationships between models and counter-models of the new piece of information ¦Ì. the postulate  c1  only requires if some strict preference  holds  then this preference should also hold in. we hence propose a stronger version of  c1   called  clex   and characterized by:
 clex  if ¦Á is not contradictory  ¦Á |= ¦Ì and ¦Â |=  ¦Ì then bel  ¦·   ¦Ì     ¦Á ¡Å ¦Â   ¡Ô bel ¦·   ¦Á .
¡¡note also that  clex  implies  c1   by replacing ¦Â by the contradiction ¡Í.
theorem 1 a revision operator   satisfies the postulates  p1     p1  and  clex  iff its associated p-faithful assignments leading toare such that
  if ¦Ø ¦Ø1 |= ¦Ì then ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ø1 iff ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ì ¦Ø1 
  if ¦Ø |= ¦Ì and ¦Ø1|= ¦Ì then ¦Ø  ¦· ¦Ì ¦Ø1.
¡¡revision operator   satisfying  clex  constraints each models to be strictly preferred to all counter-models of the new piece of information ¦Ì. moreover  it preservers the order between the models of ¦Ì. an example of revision operator satisfying  clex  is the revision with memory proposed in  papini  1  and hinted by spohn  spohn  1   see also  nayak  1; konieczny and pino pe¡ärez  1  .
definition 1 let ¦· be an epistemic state and ¦Ì be a propositional formula  the revised epistemic state ¦· .¦Ì corresponds to the following partial pre-order:
 
 
  if ¦Ø ¡Ê mod ¦Ì  and ¦Ø1¡Ê mod ¦Ì  then ¦Ø  ¦· .¦Ì ¦Ø1.
example 1 let us again consider the epistemic state ¦· represented by figure 1. let ¦Ì be a new information such that ¦Ì = a. we have mod ¦Ì  = {¦Ø1 ¦Ø1}. then  the revision of ¦· by the new information ¦Ì is represented by the partial pre-order. described by figure 1

1 conclusion
this paper has first proposed a new definition of faithful assignment suitable for revising partially ordered information. we then propose a revised version of katsuno and mendelzon's postulates. a representationtheoremhas been proposed for any revision operator satisfying this new set of postulates.
¡¡the paper also proposed a characterization of darwiche and pearl's postulates and a characterization of boutilier's postulate when information is partially ordered. two new postulates with their representation theorem have been proposed for capturing two other forms of belief revision.
¡¡when dealing with partial pre-orders  we have shown that revision operators satisfying iterated revision postulates such c1 does not allow to guarantee that ¦· and identical on some subdomains  for instance on mod ¦Ì  ¡Á mod ¦Ì  if c1 is satisfied . a future work will be to investigate additional postulates that preserve equality on some subdomains. for instance  it would be interesting to consider a stronger version of p1  by requiring equality between epistemic states instead of logical equivalence between belief sets.
¡¡even if results of this paper are oriented belief revision  it can be interesting to discuss this work in the framework of updating  katsuno and mendelzon  1   since updating has also questioned  r1   even if representation theorems are clearly different .
¡¡another future work is to extend results to this paper to the revision of a partial pre-order by a partial pre-order and extends  for instance  postulate proposed in  benferhat et al.  1 .
