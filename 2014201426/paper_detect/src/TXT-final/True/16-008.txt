	i 	introduction 
　　　the technique of dynamic time warping by vising dynamic programming is powerful for i s o l a t e d word r e c o g n i t i o n . 
       vintsyuk proposed a connected spoken word r e c o g n i t i o n method based on t h i s p r i n c i p l e in 1   1   . in 1  sakoe also proposed independently another algorithm from a view point of p a t t e r n matching   c a l l e d two level dp matching; tldp . 
       recently  myers and rabiner have presented a new dtw-based connected word recognition a l g o r i t h m   c a l l e d level b u i l d i n g dp matching   l b     1   . this a l g o r i t h m produces the same r e s u l t as tldp except for the d i f f e r e n c e of the matching window. this is less cpmputation  but not a r e a l time oriented a l g o r i t h m . 
therefore  sakoe and watari led a new r e a l time oriented algorithm by changing the computation order of lb   c a l l e d clock-wise dp matching; cwdp    1     this uses f a r less computation  but more memory storages. 
       in l a s t year  the auchor proposed two new algorithms based on the same p r i n c i p l e as described above. one is the constant time delay dp 
matching  ctdp . this algorithm is the extention of tldp  that i s   executes the computation at every constant time delay  w frames  instead of every frame. thus  the computation of l o c a l distance reduces a f a c t o r of 1 ~ 1. the another is 1 n  dp 
matching. 	the t o t a l amount of computation is the same as that of i s o l a t e d spoken word r e c o g n i t i o n 
by dp matching  that i s   a f a c t o r of r  width of matching window  f o r tldp. however  t h i s 1 n  dp matching cannot be applied to connected word 
r e c o g n i t i o n w i t h s y n t a c t i c a l c o n s t r a i n t s . 
in t h i s paper  we describe a new type method 
1 	formalization of connected word recognition principle 
　　　let us consider the connected spoken word recognition problem such that it is to.find the sequence of reference patterns  r = r r . . . r of length x which best matches  minimum cumulative distance  the test pattern t  over a l l possible concatenation of x reference patterns. if the number of words in the test pattern is not known  the minimization should be performed over a l l length x. 
       the basic procedure for finding r is to solve a time alignment problem between t and r using a dynamic time warping method  dp matching . therefore we should use an asynmetric dp pass to apply dynamic programming for connected word recognition. 
       f i g . l shows various types of asynmetric dp passes. in this paper  we use the type  a  to

                                                   we propose a new connected word recognition fig.1. a l g o r i t h m based on our word s p o t t i n g a l g o r i t h m . our method is based on the f o r m a l i z a t i o n of equations   1

1 application to connected word recognition 
　　　oka has presented a connected word recognition algorithm based on a word spotting algorithm  called continuous dp   however  his word spotting algorithm is incomplete on the application continuous dp. we find acdp is an approximate method for calculating d  m+l:i   
we think  however  it is a fairly good approximation. where r corresponds to a skipped range between words and r1 an overlapped range.

memory storages f o r reference patterns and working 

v comparison with other algorithms 
　　　table 1 summarizes the amount of computation and memory storages for various algorithms. 	the amount of computation for phrase level  word decision level  is abbreviated. 	the amount of 
area is also abbreviated. in general  n o t i c e t h a t the computation time of l o c a l distance  distance between frames  consumes about as f i v e or ten times as that of cumulative distance per one execution and that the value of |a| is several times of n  dependent on t a s k   . here we assumed that the window of dp matching was the slope of 1/ . to 1   f o r example   h ~ e  in fig.1 and f i g . 1   . 
　　　augmented continuous dp  acdp  matching a l g o r i t h m is a b e t t e r approximate algorithm of the s o l u t i o n f o r the equations  1  and   1   . in other 
words  owing to the approximate s o l u t i o n   uncertain parts in word boundaries might be skipped f o r matching  that i s   t h i s has a f u n c t i o n of unconstrained endpoints dp matching. this was extended to emmit some  k  candidate l o c a t i o n s and 
matching scores f o r every word and frame. 	the 
s u i t a b l e value of k is about 1 from view point of computation  memory storage and accuracy. in t h i s case  the value of k' becomes about 1 to 1. we t h i n k that acdp algorithm is a s u i t a b l e algorithm for a task w i t h large vocabulary or complex syntax.
