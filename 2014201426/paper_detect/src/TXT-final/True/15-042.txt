	i 	introduction 
　　　in this paper we report on an experiment intended as the f i r s t in a series designed to explore the effects of using different representations of uncertainty within a rule-based expert system. existing systems employ a variety of uncertainty calculi which although based on formal theories  are usually implemented in an ad hoc way with l i t t l e or no effort expended on experimental tests of their validity. 
　　　in an attempt to clarify some of these issues  we have used rubric  rule based retrieval of information by computer   a research prototype system for rule-based information retrieval  see mccune et al  for f u l l system details   as the vehicle for our investigation. information retrieval is a good domain for such experimentation since the user is responsible for both the knowledge base and the ground truth against which performance is measured. the rubric system is designed to help users by providing automated and relevant access to unformatted textual databases. a specific retrieval request is carried out by a goal-oriented inference process  in which the root node of the search tree represents a semantic concept or topic that the user wants retrieved. nodes further down the tree represent intermediate concepts with which the root is defined  and the nodes at the leaves of the tree represent patterns of words that are to be searched for in the database. each arc in the tree may be given a weight  which ve can interpret as  truth  or  belief  or  confidence  as we wish. this allows the intermediate concepts and keyword expressions that are found to add differing amounts to our overall confidence that the root concept has indeed been retrieved. it is with the calculus by which these uncertainty values are propagated that this paper is concerned. 
	ii 	experimental method 
　　　within the literature of expert systems  there have been several attempts to construct a  calculus of uncertainty   some based on the concepts of probability and others on the more general formalisms of mathematical logic  see shafer and zadeh for an introduction to some of these . in this experiment  we assume that uncertainty can be represented as a numerical value in the interval  1   but rather than view the uncertainty values as probabilities  as do systems such as prospector   we view them as the truths of the associated propositions. that is  the uncertainty 
value attached to the proposition  x is a  is the truth of what it asserts rather than the probability that the event that it describes occurred. this being the case  we need to construct a calculus to handle these non-classical truth values. fortunately  such calculi have been studied extensively  and go under the name of multi-valued logics. we draw upon this work in what follows. 
　　　the f i r s t task is to define a set of operators for conjunction  the and connective   and disjunction  the or  connective . there are many we could choose  but we shall consider three pairs as summarized in table 1. here v a  and v b  denote the truth values of the primary propositions  with 
v a and b  and v a or  b  denoting the value of their conjunction and disjunction respectively. negation  the unary operator not  is assumed always to be given by v not a  ＊ 1 - v a . 
　　　the second task is to define a mechanism for performing rule-based inference. recall that in two-valued logic the modus ponens rule allows b to be inferred from a and a- b. however  in a multi-
valued logic  we need to extend this idea so that v b  can be computed from any given v a  and v a- b   where -  is some multi-valued implication. functions that allow us to compute v b  are called detachment operators  and are denoted * in this paper . again  there are many we could choose  but we have selected four which are shown in table 1  together with the corresponding implications. 
     let us denote a particular calculus by c   i   j   where 'i' is an index over the conjunct-disjunct 

operators and 'j' is an index over the detachment operators. we see that some of the c   i   j   are well known; in particular  c 1  is lukasiewicz's nondenumerably infinite system   l     and c 1 l  is a system proposed by zadeh . another calculus of interest is c 1   which we can view as a ' pseudo-probability  logic in which a and b are independent events. 
　　　having defined the operators  our basic experiment involves the definition of a query   i . e .   a set of production rules   the selection of a representative story set and the repeated application of the query to the story set. since we have defined twelve separate calculi for uncertainty propagation  three pairs of conjunctdisjunct operators and four detachment operators  the experiment w i l l result in twelve potentially distinct orderings of the story set. 
　　　as a typical query we selected  acts of terrorism   and then developed a structure for this concept. this tree of successively more precise sub-concepts should be interpreted as a definition for a prototypical story  and is translated into a set of lisp production rules  some of which are shown in figure 1. the f i r s t four rules in the query have consequents that correspond to the top

node of the concept tree. when we compute the overall truth for a particular story  we combine the truths from these rules by using an or connective. at the lowest level in the tree antecedents to rules are simple keywords or keyword expressions. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　are relevant to our query. those marked with a double asterisk were determined to be definitely relevant and those marked with a single asterisk were determined to be marginally relevant  thus defining our subjective ground truth. 
	i i i 	measures 1f performance 
　　　rubric's basic task is to assign a weight to each story in the data base. this weight is the truth of the statement  this story is relevant to the query   with its value being determined by propagating the uncertainty values through the structure defined by the query rule set. this makes the assessment of performance somewhat complicated  since we are interested in the properties of the ordering  both in absolute terms   i . e .   the truth values returned  and with reference to the ordering that we determined beforehand.

indeed  there seem to be four calculi  c   l   1     c 1   c 1  and c 1   whose performance is practically indistinguishable. 
　　　these results are most interesting. they show that a change in calculus can indeed have a marked effect on the interpretation of a query. thus 
although some calculi seem totally inappropriate  there are others which apparently capture our notion of uncertainty. however  in our search for an understanding of why some calculi did better than others we became aware of the fact that there are some subtle issues that can affect the interpretation of our results. we discuss two of these in the next section. 
for the purposes of this paper we have adopted 

two basic measures. both of these are based on the idea of using a selection threshold to partition the ordered stories so that those above it are  relevant  and those below it are  irrelevant . in the f i r s t we lower the threshold until we include a l l those deemed a. p r i o r i relevant  and then count the number of unwanted stories that are also selected  denoted nf . in the second we raise the threshold until we exclude a l l irrelevant stories  and then count the number of relevant ones -that are not selected  denoted nm . the f i r s t definition n 
therefore gives us an insight into the system's ability to reject unwanted stories  precision   whereas second gives us insight into the systems a b i l i t y to select relevant stories  recall . there are other measures we could use to give a more complete picture of performance  see  for details   and we recognize that in practice the  goodness  of the system's performance w i l l depend on a balance of these measures. 
	iv 	analysis of. results 
　　　using the two basic performance measures described in the previous section  rubric's performance is summarized in table 1. for example  c l 1  gave 1 false hits when we applied the precision measure and 1 missed stories when we applied the recall measure. remembering that our story data-base has 1 entries of which 1 are marked as being relevant  we see that some calculi gave good performance whichever measure we used  while others performed veil on one but inadequately on the other. interestingly  no one calculus seems to be significantly better than any of the others.

	v 	inconsistency and dependency 
       the f i r s t confounding e f f e c t we have c a l l e d inconsistency  and it r e l a t e s to the mismatch between two t r a n s l a t i o n s of the r e t r i e v a l concept that we have used; we define both a p r i o r ordering of the story set  which we can view as a d e c l a r a t i v e statement of the concept  and a r u l e based query  which we can view as a procedural d e f i n i t i o n of the concept. obviously  one or the other  or both  of these may not capture exactly the user's i n t e r n a l model of the concept being r e t r i e v e d . if that is the case  then attempts to compare them w i l l lead to e r r o r s of assessment. as examples of m i s - t r a n s l a t i o n of the f i r s t kind   i . e .   incorrect l a b e l l i n g     consider s t o r i e s  1  and  1 . since these deal w i t h t e r r o r i s t - r e l a t e d 
       acts in the middle-east  they should probably be considered at least marginally relevant to the query  yet i n i t i a l l y we considered them to be of no i n t e r e s t . as examples of the second kind   i . e .   inadequate s p e c i f i c a t i o n     consider s t o r i e s  1  and  1 . while story  1  is d e f i n i t e l y relevant  a story about a car bombing   it is o f t e n not selected when the query is applied to the story data base. on the other hand  story  1  is j u 1 t as c l e a r l y i r r e l e v a n t  a story about a boxing 
match   	and yet 	it often receives a high r a t i n g . 
       the second confounding e f f e c t we have called dependency. it is caused by i n t e r a c t i o n between the rule-based query and c   i   j   . an i m p l i c i t assumption of our experiment is that we can consider the e f f e c t s of c   i   j   independently of the s p e c i f i c a t i o n of the query. however  a p a r t i c u l a r query may r e l y on a p a r t i c u l a r c   i   j   for i t s e f f e c t i v e n e s s . indeed  it could be that c e r t a i n forms of query are b a s i c a l l y incompatible w i t h c e r t a i n c   i   j   . thus  f o r example  if we wished to r e l y on the i m p l i c i t d i s j u n c t i o n between rules to produce a magnifying e f f e c t when there are several paths to a sub-concept  then a calculus which uses max-min as and-or connectives w i l l never achieve the desired e f f e c t . so although calculus c 1  was not selected as one of the   b e s t     t h i s may be because the form of query we used mediated against i t . perhaps if we had f i x e d c 1  as our u n c e r t a i n t y c a l c u l u s   then we could have constructed an e f f e c t i v e query around i t . 
	vi 	conclusions 
       the experiment described above shows that changing the u n c e r t a i n t y calculus does change the performance of rubric  w i t h some of the c a l c u l i c l e a r l y f a i l i n g t o produce s a t i s f a c t o r y r e s u l t s . however  the v a r i a t i o n s we observed had some unexpected c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s which led us to a c o n s i d e r a t i o n of some deeper issues of consistency and dependency. 
       our conclusion is 	that 	s p e c i f i c a t i o n 	of 	an u n c e r t a i n t y 	representation 	is 	a 	problem of some complexity and s u b t l e t y . 	we believe that there are i n t e r a c t i o n s 	between the form of the query and the admissible r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s   and 	w i l l 	continue 	to explore 	these  	and 	other 	e f f e c t s   	in subsequent experiments.
