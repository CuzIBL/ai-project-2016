foreword 
           a f t e r t h i s paper was submitted f o r review  the work of two mathematicians  arthur dempster and glenn shafer  was brought to my a t t e n t i o n . shafer has published a book  'a mathematical theory of e v i d e n c e '   which establishes a r i g o r o u s l y founded theory of reasoning under uncertainty   1   . p l a u s i b l e inference is based on the uncertainty formulas devised by s h o r t l i f f e and buchanan  who took pains to p o i n t out that t h e i r formulas were ad hoc  or   1   . comparison w i t h shafer's formulas reveals that the formulas employed in p l a u s i b l e inference must be revised to be c o r r e c t . the p r i n c i p a l e r r o r s are of two kinds: neglect of c o n f l i c t i n g evidence  for which the conjunction is f a l s e w i t h c e r t a i n t y ; and neglect of set i n c l u s i o n  whereby some assertions e i t h e r may or may not be arranged as subsets of o t h e r s   . 
           in p a r t i c u l a r . theorem 1  on page 1 of the paperback e d i t i o n of shafer's book states that the minimum r u l e f o r conjunctions  support for a c o n j u n c t i o n is the minimum of the supports for i t s arguments  applies if and only if the assertions that are the arguments are 'consonant'; i . e .   that they can be arranged by some c r i t e r i o n for set i n c l u s i o n and accordingly do not support c o n f l i c t in the evidence. t h i s   of course  also applies to the maximum r u l e f o r d i s j u n c t i o n s . shafer gives the correct r u l e s f o r heterogeneous and c o n f l i c t i n g

evidence in paragraphs 1 and 1 of chapter 1. beterogeneous evidence r e f e r s to conjunctions which may be t r u e   whoae arguments cannot be arranged in subsets  and which may support c o n f l i c t in the evidence. support f o r t h i s type of conjunct is given by the product of the support f o r the arguments. c o n f l i c t i n g evidenoe r e f e r s to conjuncts whose support is guaranteed to be f a l s e w i t h c e r t a i n t y  support - 1   . thus we discover that the p r i n c i p a l impact of the c o r r e c t i o n s to p l a u s i b l e inference is on the formulas f o r c a l c u l a t i n g the support f o r conjunctions and d i s j u n c t i o n s   and the knowledge r e q u i r e d as to when to apply which formula. 
           bappily  the conceptual framework of p l a u s i b l e inference survives i n t a c t   as do many of the formulas. for example  the formula for ' c r e d i b i l i t y summation' is c o r r e c t f o r consonant and heterogeneous evidence. dempster's r u l e f o r orthogonal summation reduces to the same r e s u l t f o r those cases. a d i f f e r e n t summation formula r e s u l t s when evidence is guaranteed to be c o n f l i c t i n g . we r e t a i n the assumption of d i r e c t e d propagation of support in i m p l i c a t i o n a   whereby c o n d i t i o n a l support is p r o p o r t i o n a l to a 'relevance f a c t o r 1 . these c a l c u l a t i o n s   based on the relevance f a c t o r s or a l ' s   are not considered by shafer. various inconsistencies are removed by employing shafer's formulas. in p a r t i c u l a r   the law of the excluded middle always h o l d s   as well as n o r m a l i x a t i o n   ao that b e l i e f in a defined 'frame of discernment' or universe of discourse always adds up to 1  and the conjunction of support f o r and against an a s s e r t i o n is always c e r t a i n l y f a l s e .

background 
　　　　　one of 	the basic 	assumptions of 	standard l o g i c is 	that the 	t r u t h 	value of 	predicates 	is known w i t h c e r t a i n t y . 	this assumption is j u s t i f i e d for some 	domains of 	reasoning  but 	is not 	v a l i d 
when  for example  we are confronted by problems of diagnosis or hypothesis generation in s c i e n t i f i c experiments. in such domains there may be c o n f l i c t i n g evidence f o r . or against p a r t i c u l a r assertions and a human  when reasoning about them uses measures of b e l i e f other than true or f a l s e to characterize h i s u n c e r t a i n t y .

           logicians and philosophers hsve studied t h i s phenomenon f o r many years and have proposed various c r i t e r i a as formal models  p a r t i c u l a r l y for c o n f i n i n g evidence. the mathematician  george polys  wrote a book about the modes of reasoning employed by f e l l o w mathematicians  and emphasised the importance of u n c e r t a i n t y even in mathematical reasoning. he suggested that humans used non-standard r u l e s of inference that included c o n f i r m a t i o n and denial in a d d i t i o n to ponens and t o l l e n s   1   . recently zadeh and h i s school have developed the concept of fussy l o g i c which deals e x t e n s i v e l y w i t h u n c e r t a i n t y   1   . an approach which has been useful in a l i m i t e d domain of medical diagnosis was formulsted by s h o r t l i f f e and buchanan f o r t h e i r ai system  mycin. mycin is s p r o d u c t i o n system and reasons only in a c o n f i r m a t i o n mode f o r a p a r t i c u l a r subset of l o g i c a l expressions i n the p r o p o s i t i o n a l c a l c u l u s . 
	this paper 	presents 	a 	g e n e r a l i s a t i o n 	of 
s h o r t l i f f e and buchanan's theory to the four modes of reasoning suggested by polys  and to a r b i t r a r y expressions of the p r o p o s i t i o n a l c a l c u l u s . the r e s u l t a n t theory of reasoning w i t h uncertain b e l i e f s is c a l l e d p l a u s i b l e inference and has been implemented as the pi system. pi has been applied to the t r o u b l e - s h o o t i n g of a spacecraft a f t e r the execution of an experiment has f a i l e d   and t h i s example's o p e r a t i o n w i l l be described b r i e f l y here. 
           s h o r t l i f f e and buchanan   h e r e a f t e r r e f e r r e d to as s and b  give an extensive discussion of t h e i r choice of measures of u n c e r t a i n t y as f u n c t i o n s o f c o n d i t i o n a l p r o b a b i l i t i e s . i n p a r t i c u l a r   they p o i n t out that humans reasoning about u n c e r t a i n assertions do not employ evidence for an a s s e r t i o n to measure t h e i r d i s b e l i e f . independent evidence is r e q u i r e d in normal human reasoning t o b o l s t e r d i s b e l i e f i n the a s s e r t i o n . as a r e s u l t t h e i r model and ours t r e a t measures of b e l i e f and d i s b e l i e f as independent q u a n t i t i e s .

　　　　　　weighting t y t t e m of numbers a t t i g n e d to each arc l i n k i n g the nodet. the arc numbers are p r o p o r t i o n a l i t y f a c t o r s that determine the amount of confidence t r a n t m i t t e d from evidence towardt c o n c l u t i o n t . once c o n f i i e n c e in the evidence hat 
with the system working in the confirmation node. 
           the pi working example hts a tree structure shown in pig. 1. the nodes oonverge to s goal state which is the root of the tree. in this example  we assume that the nodes constitute a plan of physical processes and conditions leading to the goal state  and that  after execution of the plan  the goal state is not achieved; i.e.  it is false. thus we are seeking to isolate the cause of the failure in one of the leaves of the tree. we proceed from the root of the tree toward the leaves  attempting to isolate the failed leaf by pruning off those parts of the tree closest to the root that are s t i l l working; i.e.  that are true. once again we are proceeding in essentially one direction  in a rather rigid manner as compared with a human  but in this example pi employs two modes  tollens and confirmation. 
	pi also requires the same type of 	numbers 
assigned to its 	arcs  and 	i have 	given them the name 'relevance factors'. 	in both 	the mycin and prospector 	systems 	they 	are 	determined 	by the subjective 	estimates 	of 	human 	experts 	in the knowledge domain  and 	are not 	altered except for system debugging 	purposes. 	by 	contrast  for the type of solution method described above  the pi system has been provided with a simple heuristic that permits it to estimate how the value of the relevance factors should be altered in a given neighborhood  on the basis of evidence it receives. this a b i l i t y enables it to work on problems for which the relevance factors are not known in advance  and prepares the way for embedding in a learning system. 
         clearly we are not exploiting the f u l l power of the pi system by using only the solution methods illustrated by fig. 1. a far more interesting and efficient approach is described by fig 1. we presume that for any realistic problem the tree of fig. 1  describing the states and actions  w i l l be very large. fig. 1 shows only a small neighborhood of that tree. what a human very 

often does  when confronted with such a problem  is to select  on the basis of  usually unconscious  criteria and inferences  a specific neighborhood of the web of relations  and test the function represented by that neighborhood. 
         an augmented pi might be able to do the same thing by using a set of criteria stored in a separate knowledge base. examples of such rules are  'what was the last thing altered sinoe this plan worked correctly ' or 'what is the cheapest test that can be performed verifying the nodes of the tree '. such a body of knowledge would form a 
meta-rule domain of the kind described by davis  and the same pi inference engine that reasons about spacecraft experiments could be used to reason about where to choose the next neighborhood for testing. in fact  in this case a l l the nodes of the tree are candidates for control selection  
making his approach imperative. 
         let us assume that either an augmented pi system has selected a node for checking as shown in fig. 1  or simply that a human has suggested i t . 
if a test is then made that determines the truth or falsity of that node  a degree of certainty can be assigned to that node. the pi system already hat the capacity to propagate that change in certainty in both directions  thus providing much more information on the choice of the next test to perform. 
an example of fault diagnosis 
         the specific example implemented is intended to exercise some of the belief propagation processes of plausible inference. it also demonstrates the feasibility of writing an algorithm for estimating relevance factors  which measure the strength of binding between antecedents and consequents as evidence is adduced. 
	this is an 	unrealistioally small 	problem. 
 see  for a detailed description.  the pruning methods employed are clearly too costly for large plans so long as the method of solution is that of making every test from the root towards the leaves as in fig 1. the example i t s e l f is taken from the application domain being worked on at jpl  and uses as its knowledge base s model of normal operation of a spacecraft generated by another operating module  the jpl planner  for commanding the spacecraft. 
         the personnel monitoring the spacecraft are rarely experts in a l l of the complex sub-systems that can f a i l . therefore it would be most useful if these already available plans of normal operation could be made to serve as guides for focussing attention on specific subsystems  a kind of spacecraft f i r s t - a i d . for in-depth fault diagnosis  detailed models of failure modes would be required  just as doctors and ai researchers have built up models of disease to guide automatic diagnosis systems. 
         the planner is the part of the jpl ai system which generates a plan for achieving a specified goal state. the actions leading to

           let us sum up case 1a in words. for a c o n j u n c t i o n that is t r u e   the b e l i e f that is t r a n s m i t t e d is no more than the least b e l i e f in i t s arguments. for a conjunction that is f a l s e   the more arguments that are f a l s e   the more strongly supported is d i s b e l i e f in the co-member of the i m p l i c a t i o n . the arguments which are true make no c o n t r i b u t i o n . for a d i s j u n c t i o n   true and false are interchanged.

which is c l e a r l y in e r r o r if a a|a  ia not e i t h e r 1 or 1. we t h e r e f o r e define al ala  - 1 for a l l nodes. an axiom of p l a u s i b l e inference is t h a t there s h a l l be no propagation of c r e d i b i l i t y from an a s s e r t i o n to i t s e l f . 
           a s i a i l a r d i f f i c u l t y arises when we model sequential events by using p l a n n e r - l i k e context l a y e r a . such modelling permits a aingle aource of support to change c r e d i b i l i t y only s l i g h t l y in a new context l a y e r   in e f f e c t leading to adding i t s previous c o n t r i b u t i o n t o i t s e l f . this s i t u a t i o n can be avoided in implementation by always reaoving the previous c o n t r i b u t i o n if the present c o n t r i b u t i o n ie f r o a the same source as the previous one. the c o n t r i b u t i o n f r o a other sources is then given by

where b is the balance l e f t   t is the t o t a l c r e d i b i l i t y suaaation  and s is the old c o n t r i b u t i o n f r o a the same source. obviously  care must be taken not to t r y to reaove a c o n t r i b u t i o n of c e r t a i n t y   s - 1. such an a t t e a p t ia regarded aa c o n t r a d i c t o r y . note that t h i s overcoaes a d i f f i c u l t y in s and b's aonotonic system. p l a u s i b l e inference is rendered non-monotonic by the use of the above equation.

           in words  when one of the arguments of an implication it i t s e l f an implication that has changed c r e d i b i l i t y   the calculation reduces to case 1a-l and 1a-1 by substituting the equivalent disjunction or conjunction for the implication. when a is true  the support of i t s arguaents converges on z  supporting i t s belief to the extent that not p and q support belief in z  added together as a c r e d i b i l i t y summation. when a is false  it propagates i t s c r e d i b i l i t y as an implication. note  however  that when a is true  the convergence rule usually conforms to the more i n t u i t i v e notion that the c r e d i b i l i t y of the implication is what is transmitted. this follows because normally the beliefs are  p true  q true   or  p false  q false . when that is the case  only one term contributes to the support for z  the same result as the extremum rule. 
case 1 b l . 	we have another fanout 	case where 

as above  case 1bl reduces to case 1b. for z true  we have 

the a term reduces to case 1 a l - l or 1ai-1  according to whether a is true or false. a then fans out to the z terms  with or without convergence  as in oase 1 . case 1bl. this is the case for 
where z   1  ia the target assertion  and conn is one of and  or  not and  not 1 . if the 
 conn . . .   expression reduces to a collective c r e d i b i l i t y aa in case 1 a - l . 1bl reduces to 1bl. 
if it is a convergence  aa in 1 a - 1   then it is handled aa in 1 b l except that each term of the source is adding support to both p and q  e i t h e r to i or d aa a p p r o p r i a t e .
