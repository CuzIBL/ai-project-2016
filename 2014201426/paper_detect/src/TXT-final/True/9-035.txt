an answer from the statements in the story without using general knowledge about the consider a fact l i k e : 
	 1  	if   i t  s cor w i l l be  raining  and 
if  person p is outside  then *'p wi 1 get wet  
we have an intuitive belief that  1  is a fact about   r a i n     rather than  say  a fact about  outside.  many things happen outside and getting wet is only one of them. on the other hand only a limited number of things happen when it rains. 
　　　we w i l l enbody this belief in our system by associating  1  with   r a i n   so that only when   r a i n   comes up in the story w i l l we even consider using rule  1 . we w i l l say that rain is the  topic  concept  of  1 . to put this another way  when a concept is brought up in a story  the facts associated with it are  made  available  for use in making deductions.  we w i l l also say that the facts are  out in  or   a s s e r t .     so  if  circus   say  has never come up  the program w i l l not be able to make deductions using those facts associated only with  circus.  
　　　mote however that we are not saying that  rain  has to be mentioned e x p l i c i t l y in the story before we can use  1 . it is only necessary that there be a   r a i n   assertion put into the data base. other parts of the story may provide facts which cause the program to assert that it is raining. for example: 
body  an arbitrary program . we w i l l execute the body of the fact only when an assertion is in the data base which matches the pattern.  we w i l l also say that the assertion  excites  the fact.  in  1  the pattern would be  someone outside.  then in  1  when we introduce  1  no assertion matches the pattern. but the next line creates a matching assertion  so the fact w i l l be excited. we w i l l say that a fact is  looking forward  when its topic concept appears before the assertion which matches the pattern. when the assertion which 
matches the pattern comes f i r s t we w i l l say that the fact is  looking backward   as in 
1 . 
　　　we can see how important looking forward is with a few examples. 
 1   janet was thinking of getting jack a ball for his birthday. when she told penny  penny said  'don't do that. jack has a b a l l . '   here we interpreted the line  jack has a b a l l   as meaning that he did not want another. the common sense knowledge is the fact that in many cases having an x means that one w i l l not want another x. this piece of information would probably be f i l e d under  things to consider when about to get something for somebody else.  naturally it was an earlier line which mentioned that janet was thinking of getting jack a b a l l . 
 1    b i l l offered to trade his pocket knife for jack's dog tip. jack said '  w i l l ask janet  tip is her dog t o o . '   the last line is interpreted as the reason jack w i l l ask janet. this requires information about the relation between trading and 
ownership. 
 1   janet wanted to get some money. she found her piggy bank and started to shake i t . 	she didn't hear 
anything.  the last line means that there was nothing in the piggybank 
on the basis of facts about plggybanks. 
in each of these cases it is an earlier line which contains the information which is used to assign the interpretation. so in  1  there is nothing inherent in the line  jack has a b a l l   which means  don't get him another.  if there were  something in the line would also have to key a check for the following situations: 
 1  b i l l and dick wanted to play baseball. when jack came by b i l l 
said  there is jack. he has a b a l l .   
 1  tom asked his father if he would buy him a b a l l . 	 jack has a b a l l     said tom. 
1 
 1  b i l l ' s ball of string was stuck in the tree. he asked jane how he could set it out. jane said  you should hit it with something. here comes jack. me has a b a l l .   
　　　those familiar with planner might notice that our  facts  look quite simillar to planner antecedent theorems  with the exception that our facts can  look hack  as well as  look forward.  antecedent theorems are only designed to look forward. i i n i t i a l l y formulated facts as antecedent theorems because 1 was so impressed with the need to  look forward.  however  rather then call the facts antecedent theorems  i call them  demons  since it is a shorter name. 
　　　specification and removal of demons. it should be emphasized that the model does not  learn  the information contained in the demons. this information is put in by the model maker. on the other hand  the demons are not specific to the story in the sense that they mention jack  or  the red b a l l .   rather  they talk about  a person x  who at one point in the story could he jack  at another. b i l l . we will assume a mechanism for binding some of the variables of the demon   spicifying  the demon  at the time the demon is asserted. 
　　　we want demons to be active only while they are relevant to the story  a story nay start by talking about getting a present for jack  but ultimately revolve around the games played at his party. we will need some way to remove the  present getting  demons when they have outlived their usefulness.  an irrelevant but active demon not only wastes time and space  but can cause us to 
misinterpret a new line.  as a f i r s t approximation we w i l l assume that a demon is declared irrelevant after a given numer of lines have gone by. 
　　　base rout ines. so far we have said that demons are asserted when the proper concept has been mentioned. but this implies that there is something attached to the concept name t e l l i n g us what demons should be put in  if we look at a particular example  say  1   it is b i l l ' s offer to trade which sets up the context for the rest of the fragment. i w i l l assume that the information to do so is in the form of a program. such routines  
which are available to set up demons  will be called  base routines.  
　　　these base routines w i l l he responsible for more than setting up demons. suppose we are told that jack had a b a l l   and bill a top. then jack traded his ball to bill for the top. one question we might ask is  who now has the top   naturally since questions of  who has what  are important in understanding stories we w i l l want to keep tabs on such information. in this particular case  it must again be the  trade  statement which t e l l s us to switch possession of the objects. every time a trade occurs we w i l l want to exchange objects  so whenever we see  trade  we execute the  trade  base routine. of course  the program can't be too simpleminded  since it must also handle  i w i l l t r a d e . . .   and perhaps even  will you trade 
. . .     
　　　a good test as to whether a given fact should be part of a base routine or a demon is whether we need several lines to set it up 
or whether we can illustrate the fact by presenting a single line.  naturally several lines could be made into one by putting  and's  between them  but this is dodging the point. i am only suggesting an intuitive test.  so we saw that  jack has a b a l l   was 
not enough by itself to t e l l us that jack does not want another b a l l . hence this relation is embodied by a demon  not a base routine. on the other hand  often a single line can t e l l us quite a bit as in  jack was 
on second base.  this indicates that the base routine for  second base  can often t e l l us that we are talking about a baseball game. 
	1 	bookkeeping 	and 	fact finders 
　　　undating. and. bookkeeping. up to this point we have introduced two parts of the model  demons and base routines. in this section we will introduce the remaining two parts. 
　　　again let us consider the situation when jack had a b a l l   bill a top  and they traded. when we say that bill now has the b a l l . it implies that jack no longer does. that is to 
say  we must somehow remove the fact that jack has the ball from the data base. actually we don't want to remove it  since we may be asked  who had the ball before pill d i d .   instead  we want to mark the assertion in some way to indicate that it has been updated. we will assume that there is a separate section  pretty much independent of the rest of the model  which is responsible for doing such updating. we w i l l call this section  bookkeeping.  
　　　fact finders. but even deciding that one statement updates another requires special knowledge. suppose we have; 
 1  jack was in the house. sometime later he was at the store. 
if we ask  is jack in the house   we want to answer  no  he is at the store.  cut how is bookkeeping going to figure this out  there is a simple rule which says that   state  a b  updates   state  a c  where c is not the same as b. so  at jack farm  would update  at jack new-york . but in  1  we can't simply look for jack at  someplace which is not the store   since he is in the house. to 
make things even worse  we could have: 
 1  jack was in the house. sometime later he was in the kitchen. 
to solve this problem we w i l l need:

probably more complex than we have i n d i c a t e d a 	piggy 	bank problem. 	one f a c t we know so f a r . 	consider: about pg's is t h a t they are good places to keep money. this f a c t seems to come into  1  janet was going to buy some candy. she was also going to buy some 	play 	i n : f r u i t .  1  penny said to janet   don't take your money w i t h you to the park. in  1  both occurences of  buy  w i l l  you w i l l 	lose i t .   	go and get your a c t i v a t e buy-need-money demons.  though we did not comment on t h i s e a r l i e r   the idea of pb!  s p e c i f y i n g demons as mentioned in 1  1  a f t e r janet helped ms. 	jones with obviously requires separate copies of a demon her groceries ms. 	jones gave her a to be able to e x i s t s i m u l t a n e o u s l y .   dime. 	jack came along and s a i d . however  	 1  does not imply that janet  cone w i t h me to the park  j a n e t .   r e a l l y needs money. 	for a l l we know she has  ok   said janet. 	 hut f i r s t 	i an as much as she needs in her pocket. 	if going home to f i n d my pb  	i do not demon-demon i n t e r a c t i o n were as simple as we have made it out to be  the two instances of want to take the money to the p a r k .   buy-need-money would j o i n up to produce a  1  janet put some money on the sink   need money  a s s e r t i o n . 	so it 	is not mother s a i d   	  i f you leave the money s u f f i c i e n t for two demons to be looking for there it may f a l l 	in the d r a i n . the same p a t t e r n . l e t ' s f i n d your 	pb.         looking at example  1  we note that one of the demons cave a reason why janet might in each case the n a t u r a l question i s

needing money was the cause of a c e r t a i n 	t r y to construct a  piggy bank  demon which

 1  and then make the necessary a s s e r t i o n s .

might j u s t t r y to label a l l demons as 	g r o c e r i e s . 	ms. 	jones gave janet a 
  m o t i v e   or   r e s u l t   w i t h respect to t h e i r 	dime. 	jack came along and s a i d   
p a t t e r n . 	on the other hand it might be 	  j a n e t   	l e t ' s go to the p a r k .   
possible to derive   m o t i v e   and   r e s u l t   from 	 ok   said janet. 	 but 	i want to 
more basic c o n s i d e r a t i o n s . 	at any r a t e   	it 	put my money in a safe place. 	i am 
seems premature to f o r m a l i z e such concepts at 	going to get my pc.  
t h i s p o i n t . 	we simply d o n ' t know enough. 
	flow there 	is nothing saying that our demon 
	capturein generalizations before 	needs to account f o r 	 1  	and  1 . 	however  
moving on i 	should p o i n t out that the kind of 	it seems q u i t e obvious 	that we are using the 
argument used in t h i s s e c t i o n  and the next 	same 	information 	in a i l 	the examples above  
also  	is a  capture the g e n e r a l i z a t i o n   type 	the only d i f f e r e n c e 	is that 	in  1  	-  1  we 
argument commonly found in l i n g u i s t i c s . 	we 	are expressing the need for a   s a f e place  by

the g e n e r a l i z a t i o n that   m o t i v e s   and 	common. 
  r e s u l t s   always act t h i s v/ay. 	so f a r i 	have 
only given one example to' support the  demon- 	a non-pjfrsv bank problem. 	in 	the 
demon i n t e r a c t i o n g e n e r a l i z a t i o n     but 	in 	in 	course of 	looking at examples 	l i k e 	 1  	-
the next section we w i l l see another. 	 1  1 noted examples l i k e ; 
	 1  	penny s a i d to janet  	  d o n ' t take 
1 	p u t t i n g money i n t o a piggy bank 	your money w i t h you to the park. 
	put 	it on 	the s h e l f .   
	in t h i s section we w i l l 	look at a 	 1  	a f t e r janet helped ms. 	jones w i t h 
possible demon associated w i t h piggy banks 	her groceries ms. 	jones gave her a 
and argue t h a t the deduction 	ft would account 	dime. 	jack came along and said 
f o r can be b e t t e r handled by demon-demon 	 come w i t h me to the park  j a n e t .   
i n t e r a c t i o n between two other demons. 	in 	 ok   said janet. 	 but f i r s t 	i am 
e f f e c t we w i l l be t r y i n g to determine  on an 	going to put my money in the house  
extremely small 	s c a l e   what people know. 	i 	do not want to take the money to 
	the 	p a r k .   
1 

 1  janet put some money on the sink. mother said    i f you leave the money there it may f a l l 	in the drain.  janet put the money in a drawer. 
 1  janet said  i am going to put my money away. i will put it in my toy box.  
 1  janet helped ms. jones with her groceries. ms. jones gave janet a dime. jack came along and said  janet  l e t ' s go to the park.   ok   said janet.  but i want to put my money in a safe place   then janet went into' the house and put the money in her room. 
these examples exactly mirror  1  -  1   except that  1  -  1e  don't mention pb's. naturally  in these examples the question to ask is  why did janet put the money in the drawer     in the house    etc. 
　　　such examples tend to indicate that the problem facing us is wider that just pb's. we w i l l name this wider problem the  put away  problem. however it is not the case that our problem with pb's can be completely reduced to the  put away  problem. so while in the non-piggy bank examples wo mention that janet has or actually intends to  put  the money some place. in the pb examples a l l 
we needed to say was that janet was going to get the pb. to put this another way  our knowledge of pc's allowed us to interpret  get pb  as meaning that janet was going to put money into it. however our knowledge of houses or shelves does not allow us to make similar deductions in  1  -  1 . 
　　　the put-away demon. ignoring piggy banks for the moment  what would a solution to  1  -  1  look like  we w i l l have some demon  cal1ed the put-away demon  which is activated by lines l i k e : 
 1  don't leave the money by the sink. 
 1  1 do not want to take my money to the park. 
 1  i w i l l put my money away. 
these lines will put in a demon looking for  put away  and the demon w i l l assert that the reason for putting the thing away is  1   1 . ultimately we w i l l want a theory of why people put things away   i . e .   what lines put in the  put away  demon   and how to determine what constitutes a  put away  1 ocat ton. however   1  -  1  clearly show that the problem is distinct from the 
question of what we know about pbs. 
　　　the plggv bank demon. whet we w i l l now see is that if we assume the put-away demon  a l l the examples in  1  -  1  f a l l out easily  plus a few others which we haven't even looked at yet. but f i r s t we need to consider a new pb demon entitled pb-money-in. it is parallel to pb-need-money  but while the latter was for recognizing that money was going to be taken out of he pb  pb-monfy-in is for recognizing that money is going to be put in. it says   i f you see that the person wants some money to be in the pb then the reason he is getting the pb is to put it in.   actually this theorem is true of a wide class of containers  but that does not affect the argument at hand   this demon w i l l 
account for examples tike: 
 1  ms. jones gave janet a dime. janet went to get her pb.  i want the money to be in my pb   she thought. 
 1  janet got her pb and dropped some money in. 
 1  after ms jones gave janet a dime  jack came by and asked janet if she wanted to go to the park.  ok   said janet.  i w i l l go home f i r s t and get my pb.  soon janet came back and said  my money is in the pb  l e t ' s go!  
　　　demo-demon interacion.- now  if we assume demon-demon interaction as discussed in section 1  pb-money-if plus put-away w i l l interact to solve a l l the examples from  1  to  1 . let us see how this w i l l happen. 
　　　first note that the restrictions we placed on demon-demon interactions are met here. first both demons have the same pattern  e.g.   money is in pb.   actually the pattern for put-away is   object  is in appropriate location   however  object  
w i l l be bound to the money at the time the demon is asserted  and appropriate location  
w i l l match pb when the demon is excited.  secondly  we need both a motive and a result before we can  combine  demons. in the case 
at hand  put-away is a motive for having the money in the pb  and  get pb  is a result of intending to put money in the pb. 
　　　saving money. 	finally  note that our solution extends to the following case: 
 u1  	janet got a dime from ms. jones. she said  i am saving my money to buy a bicycle. 	i am going home to get my pb.  
here we know that janet is going to put the money in the pb because of the  save  statement. however  we immedlately note that 
we have cases 1i ke: 
c1  janet got a dime from ms. jones. janet told her  i am saving my money to buy a bicycle. i am going home to put the money away.  i am going 
home to put the money in my drawer.   
naturally   kk  indicates that  save  must activate put-away. if this is the case  then  i 1  is accounted for in exactly the same manner as all the i n i t i a l examples. while the reader may not be surprised at this result. i am  since i n i t i a l l y i thought that the relationship of  save  with piggy banks 
would need a separate pb demon.

	it 	conclusion 
　　　the two halves of this paper stand in contrast to each other. the presentation of the nodel  section 1  is general  in theory covering a l l of children's stories   but vague and f u l l of covert appeals to the reader's i n t u i t i o n . section 1 on the other 
hand is narrow  only talking about small portions of our knowledge of pcs  but tightly reasoned  hopefully . flow by themselves the conclusions of 
section 1 are not that important. of course. if we could pin down one hundred facts the way we pinned down one in section 1 then vie would have the beginnings of a theory of knowledge. dut 1 did not write this paper to t e l l of one fact about pcs. rather i view 
the paper as an illustration of how one might go about the task of constructing a theory of knowledge.
