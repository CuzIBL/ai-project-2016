1        boom planning: the boom planning problem is to f i n d a t r a j e c t o r y f o r the two j o i n t s assoc i a t e d w i t h the boom. we can t r y to get the boom t i p from s to g along the s h o r t e s t path 
between the two boom tip locations - a straight line boom tip locus. 	in figure 1  the shaded area represents the area that the boom sweeps when i t s t i p traces a straight line from s to g. since the shaded area intersects the l-shaped object  the boom w i l l collide with that object. this collision can be avoided if an intermediate point p is chosen and the boom tip is required to go through p. 	the above procedure is then applied recursively to the sections sp and pg u n t i l a safe trajectory is found. 	figure 1 shows the f i n a l boom tip locus that guarantees boom safety. 
　　　forearm planning: this refers to finding a trajectory for the forearm j o i n t . the basic idea is to juggle the forearm back and forth so that it avoids any collisions as one end of it travels along the boom tip locus. this is not easy. further complications arise because the 
maneuverability of the forearm near the goal configuration is very restricted. so as not to clutter the diagram  the forearm tip locus has been supressed from figure 1. 
　　　execution: the above planning results in a sequence of intermediate configurations leading to the goal configuration. the trajectory calculation routines use this sequence to generate a trajectory. the executive system in charge of operating the hardware uses the trajectory to move the manipulator. 
　　　embellishments: the planning described is called mid-section planning. this mode of planning does not make use of the nature of obstacle configurations  and is good for planning maneuvers far from obstacles. another mode of planning  called terminal phase planning  makes use of the nature of obstacle configuration around the hand  and can be used for planning maneuvers near the start and goal configurations. the use of both the mid-section and the terminal phase planning results in a simpler trajectory  a smaller sequence of intermediate configurations . figure 1 shows the boom tip locus for the simpler trajectory. 
the representation of the manipulator  obstacles  empty space and trajectories  the two planning modes and the associated heuristics  the use of the nature of obstacle configurations for terminal maneuvers etc. are a l l discussed in sec-
tions 1 and 1. 
1 	historical perspective 
collision avoidance problems became manifest when computer controlled manipulators came into existence during the sixties. pieper  1  was the f i r s t one to investigate the problem. paul  1  tackled trajectory calculation and servoing. lewis  1  attacked a very restricted version of the collision avoidance problem  and widdoes  1  did the same. none of the earlier attempts can handle complexities similar to the ones illustrated in the example 
of figure 1. the representations used by these earlier programs are inconvenient  or the planning strategies inadequate for handling the situation. 
1. 	the problem and its analysis 
the problem is to plan a trajectory to get a computer controlled manipulator with two movable links and multiple degrees of freedom safely into a desired goal configuration. 
the planning system is i n i t i a l l y given a description of the environment in which the manipulator is to operate. this environment undergoes 
minor changes when objects in it are transported around by the manipulator. the environment may also change drastically  as would happen if the robot  to which the manipulator belonged  moved to a new place. it is assumed that such drastic changes are infrequent compared to the total number of trajectories planned. this assumption is referred to as the infrequent environment i n i t i a l i z a t i o n hypothesis. 
the input to the planning system consists of the position and orientation of the hand in the goal configuration. 	the output is a l i s t of inter-
mediate configurations that w i l l be used by the trajectory calculation programs to run the hard-
ware. 
a solution that w i l l perform well in simple and commonly occuring situations is desired. the system should recognize when things go awry and should ask for human assistance when that happens. optimal plans are not needed; at the same time  however  blatantly stupid plans are not 
permitted. 
planning begins with hypothesizing a trajectory. following this is an iterative step that involves a check for collision and a trajectory modification   i f there is danger . under normal circumstances  the loop terminates when a safe trajectory is found. 
good heuristics for hypothesizing trajectories are essential. ideally  the system should propose a collision-free trajectory on the f i r s t try. since a trajectory designed to pass through large empty spaces is likely to be safe  a characterization of large empty spaces is desirable. also  a characterization of obstacle configurations in the immediate v i c i n i t y of the hand is desirable; for  special heuristics  that i n crease the chances of proposing a collision-free trajectory  can be associated with these configurations. 
good techniques for making trajectory modifications are required; the modifications should ensure that the same problem does not recur and that new problems do not arise. 
a few terms that w i l l enable us to talk about the collision detection problem are now introduced.

the manipulator's state can be described either as a vector specifying i t s joint angles or as a position and orientation of the hand. the former is a representation in j o i n t variable space or joint space  and the latter is a representation in cartesian space. the subspace of j o i n t space generated by the boom joints is called boom space. when the manipulator moves i t s links trace a volume  surface  in two dimensions  called the trajectory envelope  see figure 1 . 
collision dectection involves checking intersections of the trajectory envelope and obstacles. trajectory envelopes are most conveniently described in j o i n t space and obstacles in cartesian space. consequently  intersection checking requires constant transformations between the two spaces. this is expensive and we need to deter-
mine whether obstacles should be represented in joint space or trajectories in cartesian space  or whether it is possible to use the two spaces effectively and avoid the transformation problem. we need to see whether trajectory envelopes and obstacle descriptions can be simplified since it would lead to inexpensive intersection checks. again  safe trajectory planning can be viewed as maneuvering in free space or as avoiding obstacles. can these complementary views be used to advantage  
the solution presented in the next two sections provides answers to a l l the points and questions raised in the above analysis  making fast c o l l i sion avoiders a distinct possibility. 
1. 	representation 
trajectory planning gets easier with simple trajectory envelopes. 	simple envelopes are possible only with well-chosen trajectory primitives and simple manipulator models. simple 
manipulator models make the task of hypothesizing and modifying trajectories easy. 	and simple trajectory envelopes and numerically manageable obstacle representations make collision detection inexpensive. 	with this in mind  polyhedra models of obstacles  a hierarchy of abstraction spaces permitting simplified manipulator models and useful trajectory primitives are introduced in this section. 	their use in planning is presented in section 1. 
starting with a simple and direct model of two connected cylinders  the abstraction spaces permit the manipulator to be modelled as two connected line segments  as a single line segment and  incredibly  as a point! furthermore  the transformations generating the abstraction spaces are inexpensive. this is important; otherwise  the advantages gained by operating in these alternate spaces would be lost in the process of generating them. 
the manipulator and i t s environment are described f i r s t   the three problem spaces next and f i n a l l y the trajectory primitives are presented. table 1 summarizes the relationship between the different problem spaces. 
1 	the manipulator and its environment 
the manipulator of section 1 is an abstraction of the class of computer controlled manipulators 
with two movable links and multiple degrees of freedom. the scheinman arm shown in figure 1 is another example. details on the hardware and algorithms for trajectory calculation and servoing of this manipulator are described in paul  1   dobrotin and scheinman  1  and lewis  1 . the manipulator is a six degree freedom device allowing the hand to be positioned anywhere  within the maneuverable space  and with any orientation. 
figure 1 shows the six joints and the links between the points. 	linkl is called the post  link1 the shoulder  and link1 the boom. 	link1 and link1 are non-existent because the manipulator design has the last three joints at the tip of the boom. 	link1 is called the forearm. except for joint1  which is a sliding j o i n t   a l l the joints are revolute. 	jointl is called phi  joint1 theta  joint1 r  joint1 f theta  joint1 f  phi  and joint1 f  psi. the prefix  f  indicates that the angles refer to the forearm. 	the forearm tip is called the hand. 
when looking along the boom at the hand  the boom is either on the right or the l e f t side of the shoulder. this gives rise to the notion of a right-handed and left-handed manipulator respectively  and is called the lateral property. to simplify the presentation  the lateral property of the manipulator w i l l henceforth be ignored. this concludes the description of the manipulator. 
the term environment w i l l be used to denote the set of obstacles in the workspace of the manipulator. since the hand can touch the manipulator post  the post  too  is considered an obstacle. obstacles can be both regular and irregular in shape. objects on a robot such as the wheels  the tv rack  the platform etc. are regular and can be described as cylinders  parallelopipeds  or unions of these shapes. boulders and rocks in the maneuverable space would be examples of irregular shaped objects. 
1 	real problem space 
the real problem space is a simple-minded and direct computer representation of the manipulator and i t s environment. the manipulator is modelled as a sequence of connected cylinders  one each for the post  boom and forearm. the boom and forearm representations correspond to the minimum 
bounding cylinders that enclose them. the trajectory envelope i s   consequently  a two-element three-dimensional solid. 
obstacles are approximated by polyhedra - planefaced objects. there is no restriction on the number of faces  and both concave and convex polyhedra are allowed. 	better approximation implies more faces  and  consequently  more storage required to save the description and 

robotics-1: tmupa 1 

more time required to analyze collisions. 	thus 
there is a trade-off involved. however  the representation is compact and intersection checks are inexpensive because obstacle surfaces are linear. the set of polyhedra  each approximating a real obstacle  is called a map. 
the maneuverable space is the complement of the volume occupied by elements of the map  with respect to the manipulator's work space. 
1 	primary problem space 
the primary problem space permits the manipulator to be viewed as consisting of a single line segment and having no lateral property. 
first consider a two-line segment model of the manipulator. the f i n i t e axes of the cylinders bounding the boom and forearm are used for this model. 	the equivalence between the primary problem space and real problem space is preserved by enlarging the polyhedra by the radius of the manipulator links. 	the enlarged polyhedra are a 
called primary obstacles. the set of primary obstacles is called the primary map. with line-segment models of the manipulator links  the trajectory envelope is two connected surfaces  one called the boom surface and the other the forearm surface. the maneuverable space is called primary free space and is the complement of the volume occupied by primary obstacles with respect to the manipulator's workspace. note that the enlargement of obstacles needs to be done just once for a given environment. 
finally  the single line segment description of the manipulator is made possible by a transformation called survey. 	survey permits the boom to be viewed as a single point  and the trajectory envelope then reduces to the forearm surface generated by the motion of the forearm. the transformation survey is applied to free space and results in a chart. 	a chart for primary free space in called a primary chart. 
consider the set of a l l points in free space such that the entire boom is safe from collision if the boom t i p were positioned there. this subset of free space is called navspace  navigational space . the survey transformation approximates navspace by boxes in r-theta-phi space called regions and the set of regions is called a chart. 
regions are structured entities. they are made up of sectoroids and  in 1d  sectorolds are composed of pases. the pasc  parallelopiped in 
spherical coordinates  is the smallest unit. figure 1 shows six 1d regions bounded by the radial arrows; it also shows one of the regions  r  and i t s four component sectoroids - s1 s1 s1 and s1. pases  sectoroids and regions are bound by constant phi and constant theta surfaces. a l l pases in a sectoroid have the same phi l i m i t s   and a l l sectoroids in a region have the same theta l i m i t s . pases  sectoroids and regions a l l have associated with them a maximum and minimum r value  called rmax and rmin respectively  indica-
ting the safe limits of the boom extension. the difference between the maximum and minimum r values is called the safe l i m i t interval. a region  sectoroid or pasc is considered impassable if the safe l i m i t interval is less than some prespecified value. these items are illustrated in figure 1. 
regions are an approximation to the points in navspace. this approximation is dynamic and can be changed by higher-level programs. the approximating procedure is called refinement  and the refinement level is called resolution. the i n i t i a l approximation is done to a default resolution. if the resolution of a particular part of the environment is not adequate  the system further refines that portion of the chart. this is termed the selective refinement capab i l i t y . this capability makes incremental modifications  necessitated by minor changes to the environment  to the charts inexpensive. since refinement is dynamic  survey is not a one-time transformation. this is the price that has to be paid for the f l e x i b i l i t y . since there is a limit to the precision of placement of the hardware  the process of refinement w i l l not continue indefinitely. 
the concept of navspace permits considering the boom as a single point. navspace and i t s approximation by charts is thus crucial to safe trajectory planning. the reason for imposing a structure on charts  in terms of regions  sectoroids and pases  is to have  some selectivity in terms of what parts of navspace should be refined and to what level. it is important to note that the exact nature of a region and i t s components is irrelevant  and the choice of a box in rtheta-phi space as the unit was dictated by the choice of a particular planning strategy described in section 1. 
1 	secondary problem space 
the secondary problem space permits the manipulator to be viewed as a single point. 
to get the single point description of the manipulator  let us start with the two-line segment model of the manipulator. we ignore the forearm  and account for it by enlarging the primary obstacles by the length of the forearm; this enlargement results in secondary obstacles and a secondary map  and the maneuverable space is called secondary free space. with the forearm accounted for  the manipulator consists of only the boom and the trajectory envelope is the boom surface. 
it is now possible to arrive at the single point description of the manipulator. 	we apply the survey transformation to secondary free space. this results in a secondary chart  composed of secondary regions. 	whenever the boom tip is in a secondary region the following holds: 

r o b o t i c s - 1 : 	udupa 
1 

1. by definition of the region  the entire boom is free of collision  and 
1. since secondary regions are generated using secondary obstacles  the forearm is free from collision irrespective of i t s orientation. 
the trajectory envelope at this level then is the line generated by the motion of the boom t i p . a complex trajectory solid that consisted of two solids has thus been reduced to a line. the refinement process for secondary charts is similar to primary charts and so are a l l the attributes and transformations discussed in the context of primary charts. 
if the manipulator needs to maneuver close to obstacles  secondary problem space is of no use since the 'gross' representation of the forearm engulfs free space near obstacles. of course this does not imply that a trajectory does not exist. the finer model of the forearm as a line segment  as in primary problem space  should be used. 
looked at from a different angle  the ideas of secondary problem space representations  the secondary charts in particular   are a formal characterization of the i n t u i t i v e ideas of ease of maneuvering in large chunks of empty space. the simplification of the trajectory envelope from two solids to a line makes the expectation come true. 
1 	trajectory primitives 
since obstacle faces are planes in cartesian 
 space  if the trajectory envelope were a plane  primary problem space  or a line  secondary problem space  in cartesian space  collision checking would be simple. 
since the manipulator joints can be operated independently  the boom tip can be made to trace cartesian space straight lines. planning the cartesian space straight line locus for the boom tip is easy in the 1d case  while it is beset 
with problems in the 1d case. 	hence in the 1d 
case  we settle for boom space - subspace of j o i n t space generated by the boom joints straight line locus for the boom t i p . 
safety of the boom t i p locus implies the safety of the entire manipulator only when the locus passes through a secondary chart; elsewhere the safety of the forearm needs to be ensured. to 
make forearm safety checks tractable  the following are chosen as primitives for the forearm trajectory. 
1. when the boom is moving  the hand shall trace a line parallel to the cartesian space straight line approximation of the boom t i p locus; this is called pgram motion  for parallelogram motion . 
r o b o t i c s - 1 
1 
1. when the boom is stationary  the forearm shall move in a single plane; this called circle motion  1d  or sphere motion  1d . 
these constraints on the boom and forearm trajectories result in the decomposition of the trajectory surface into a sequence of parallelograms and sectors of a c i r c l e   considerably simplifying the collision detection task. 
1. planning 
the process of planning a trajectory was discussed in section 1; the aim is to plan a safe trajectory  and plan it fast. 
hierarchy  separability and reversibility are the key concepts in planning. the principle of reversibility states that if a trajectory from s to g is collision free then the same trajectory backwards from g to s is also collision free. separability means the decomposition of the goal into independent subgoals. hierarchy is used in the usual sense. for each goal  the most important aspects are tackled f i r s t and the lesser ones next. this is applied to every stage of the process. if some decisions made at a higher level do not pan out  local corrections are made. if the local fixups do not solve the problems  the system returns to the next higher level for replanning. at each stage it is ensured that the system w i l l terminate i t s a c t i v i t i e s in a f i n i t e amount of time. if the system is unsuccessful in solving the problem  it gives up and asks for human help. 
1 	overview of planning 
the natural approach to hierarchical planning is to plan in secondary problem space f i r s t  since the trajectory envelope is the simplest there  and then refine the trajectory in p r i mary problem space. the d i f f i c u l t y of interfacing the two problem spaces makes this approach unattractive. so instead  planning is  done  in primary problem space and secondary problem space is used for simplifications. the details of this approach are presented next. 
the trajectory planning problem is separated into three phases. the f i r s t is a goal f e a s i b i l i t y analysis phase  the second is the mid-section planning phase and the last is the terminal planning phase. at the f e a s i b i l i t y analysis stage  goal f e a s i b i l i t y is checked and any necessary refinements of the charts is carried out. the terminal phase activities use the reversibility principle and plan trajectories near the i n i t i a l and f i n a l configurations. the mid-section phase deals with midway trajectory planning. for the terminal phase  forearm and boom planning iterate 
u n t i l a satisfactory boom tip location for starting the mid-section trajectory is found. for the midsection  planning proceeds hierarchically. boom trajectory is f i r s t planned using 
: udupa 

the primary charts alone. for portions of the boom t i p that do not l i e in the secondary chart  forearm planning is done. the separability principle is used in boom planning; the trajectory for the theta-phi joints is planned f i r s t and the r - j o i n t is fixed next. 
if a safe forearm trajectory cannot be found  the boom trajectory is modified and another attempt at forearm planning made. if the system is unable to come up with a safe trajectory even after a prespecified number of attempts  it resorts to a configuration switch. the same techniques are used to plan a trajectory to get the manipulator to the goal  this time however  in a different lateral configuration. if this also f a i l s   the system gives up. 
note that planning incorporates simple strategies. it may so happen that the system f a i l s to find a solution when there exists one in the real 
world. it is unlikely that such situations w i l l be encountered except in some pathological obstacle configurations. 
1 	i n i t i a l i z a t i o n 
the system is i n i t i a l i z e d with a description of the environment. the system uses the input polyhedra and generates primary and secondary obstacles for the l e f t and right  secondary and primary maps. a l l the charts are generated for a default resoultion  see figure 1  for example . the regions of the charts w i l l be further refined as and when necessary. the i n i t i a l i z a t i o n needs to be done once for every new environment. 
1 	goal feasibility and impossible situations 
goal f e a s i b i l i t y is done before planning begins. 
it includes boom placement and forearm placement safety checks. it determines whether the boom tip lies within a pasc of a primary region. if not  the appropriate region is repeatedly refined u n t i l either the goal boom tip position is within a pasc or the resolution l i m i t is reached and the system returns complaining that the goal is not feasible. the forearm f e a s i b i l i t y study involves checking whether in the f i n a l configuration  the forearm is safe from collision; if not  the goal is not feasible. figures 1 and 1 are refine-
ments of figure 1 to get points s and g inside the charts. the environment is the one used in the example of section 1. 
during mid-section phase boom planning  the system keeps a watch for situations which would get the boom stuck  see figure 1  for example . if the boom cannot maneuver out of an area  the system complains. again  during forearm planning along a proposed boom t i p locus  the system looks out for situations which would get the forearm stuck  see figure 1  for example . such situations are called impossible situations. 
1 	mid-section planning 
boom planning 
boom planning is equivalent to finding the path of a point through charts. cartesian space straight line locus for the boom t i p are used in the 1d system. the features of the 1d system and the required extensions for the 1d system are presented. 
point path planning is based on an adaptation of a well-known algorithm used for approximating a curve by a sequence of straight lines; the approximation is such that every point on the curve is within a specified distance from the line segment  approximating the portion of the curve the point is on . the recursive algorithm is illustrated in figure 1. point c is the farthest point on the curve from the approximating straight line ab. if the distance of c from ab exceeds the tolerance l i m i t   the curve is s p l i t at c and the algorithm applied recursively to sections ac and cb. 
the above algorithm works even if different thresholds are used for different parts of the curve. each component  region  sectoroid  or pasc  in the 1d case   has associated with it an rmax and rmin that specify the safe interval l i m i t   within which the boom tip must l i e when it goes through that component. 
figure 1 shows the working of the modified linear approximation algorithm. the dotted lines show adjacent regions of a chart and their safe l i m i t intervals. every pair of regions has a nontrivial intersection of their  rmin  rmax  interval. s and g are the start and goal boom tip locations. the arrow in the figure shows the point on sg that is farthest from being inside the regions. a subgoal p is introduced in the region contributing to the violation and the algorithm is recursively applied to sp and pg. 
figure 1 shows how adjacent regions rl and 
r1  which have t r i v i a l  rmin  rmax  interval intersections are handled by the introduction of additional subgoals po and pi. note that the line along p1 is safe from the rmin of r1 to rmax of rl. 
a further generalization of the simple recursive curve-approximation algorithm is to make the approximating line segments be any desirable curve. 	in fact  for the 1d system this generalization is used to plan a boom tip locus that is linear in the boom j o i n t angles. 
the above planning procedure is f i r s t applied at the region level  then at the sectoroid level and f i n a l l y at the pasc level. 
in the 1d manipulator  the system f i r s t plans a trajectory in the theta-phi space making only certain minimal checks on the safe l i m i t 

pobotics-1: udupa

intervals of the regions through which the trajectory passes. once this is done  the rj o i n t planning is done using the generalized linear approximation algorithm. 
forearm planning 
forearm planning is just a sequence of applications of the two primitives for the forearm trajectory. figure 1 illustrates circle 
motion; it shows the angular interval the 
forearm can move i n   the most favored orientation of the forearm for the given direction of travel of the boom  the forearm orientation chosen and the boom tip locus sg. figure 1 illustrates pgram motion; it shows the direction of travel  sg being the boom t i p locus  the i n i t i a l forearm orientation and the parallelogram generated by the forearm motion. 
1 	terminal phase planning 
terminal phase planning plans trajectories close to obstacles  primarily near the start and the goal configurations. 	the strategy consists of planning pairs of adjust and move motions. 	a sequence of such pairs of motions puts the boom tip at a safe point  from which the mid-section strategies take over. 	a safe point  is a point in a secondary pasc  or if there is no secondary pasc with a reasonable safe interval then it is a point in a primary pasc whose safe l i m i t interval exceeds a prespecified value. 
during the move motion the boom tip moves along a line collinear with the forearm and away from the hand  and the forearm maintains i t s orientation in cartesian space. 	this motion continues u n t i l either the boom t i p reaches a safe point or a potential collision is recognized. 
the adjust motion orients the forearm to reduce chances of collision during the subsequent move 
motion. figure 1 shows adjust motion heuristics - the  binary  choice of favorable orientations - for the 1d case. the numbers indicate the sequence in which these orientations w i l l be t r i e d . for a particular orientation  if it turns out that the subsequent move motion makes no progress  the next orientation in the sequence is t r i e d . if the manipulator j o i n t angles remain unchanged  even after a prespecified number of t r i e s   the system returns a failure'. 
in 1d a 1 x 1 square of solid angles is determined about the current forearm orientation. each square is 1 degress in size  and has a 1 or 1 associated with it according as it is safe or not for the forearm to maneuver within the solid angle represented by the square. the 1d adjust motion strategy is applied in the plane taking the forearm through the center of the safe solid angle interval. if more than one solid angle square is safe  obvious generalizations of the binary choice searching strategy can be t r i e d . 
instead of using software for gathering information for planning motions close to obstacles  proximity sensors can be mounted on the forearm to provide this information. the logic for analyzing realtime data from an array of such sensors is simple; the logic incorporates the simple adjust motion heuristics described above. 
1. 	conclusions 
a solution to the safe trajectory planning problem for computer controlled manipulators 
with two movable links and multiple degrees of freedom was presented. the solution treats 
manipulators with a sliding j o i n t   and permits transporting of objects which can be enclosed 
within the minimum bounding cylinder of the manipulator link. for modifications of the solution that permit handling larger objects  extensions to the solution for treating manipulators with only rotary j o i n t s   and details on how to account for the lateral property of the manipulator  the reader is referred to udupa  1 . a significant portion of the ideas described here have been implemented in sail on a dec pdp-1 computer. the output of the collision detection and avoidance system has yet to be interfaced with a real manipulator. 
1 	key ideas 
	1. 	simplified manipulator descriptions and 
           trajectory primitives: alternate problem spaces of increasing abstraction that permit simplified manipulator models and primitive trajectory types are identified; these simplify collision detection and trajectory hypothesis and modification. 
　　　1. navspace and charts: the concept of navspace that permits the reduction of the boom to a single point is identified. odd-shaped 
navspace is approximated by easily describable entities called charts; the approximation is dynamic and can be selective  thus permitting easy incremental modifications to the charts. 
　　　1. transformations for generating the primary and secondary maps and charts need to be computed only once or a few times; otherwise the advantages of using the alternative problem spaces would have been offset by the expensive computations required to generate them. 
　　　1. trajectory planning in empty space vs. collision avoidance: these two 
complementary views can be used to advantage in the safe trajectory planning problem. 	boom 
planning is treated as planning trajectories in empty space  the charts   and forearm planning is treated as a collision avoidance problem. 
　　　1. cartesian space vs. joint space: by decomposing planning into boom and forearm planning and maneuverable space into navspace
