introduction 
　　　in china ai research a c t i v i t i e s began ever from early 1's  but it had been cofined only to a small c i r c l e u n t i l the end of that decade. from then on many university departments majoring in computer science were set up. they were t r y ing hard to expand applications of computer and develop theories  expecting that computer would bring about improvement in productivity process c o n t r o l . considerable e f f o r t s have been made in t h i s d i r e c t i o n   but the results were not so satisfactory since a p r a c t i c a l process is too complex to be i d e n t i f i e d . however the fact that a veteran worker or a technician often deals s i t h the control task some hat better than a computer. the fact suggested that ai might be a succesful approach. on the other hand  to tackle some open fascinating problems l i n g u i s t s and psychologists were also drawn i n t o a i . and now ai research has been getting more and more active in china and certain usef u l results have been achieved. this paper is intended to give a b r i e f review on the following topics:

machine translation and 
natural language understanding 
　　　machine translation is the e a r l i e s t ai research work in china and experinoed its ups and downs. we may l i s t the following three systems  the f i r s t one was developed by the science technology i n f o r mation i n s t i t u t e and the other two by the computer technology institute academia sinica. 
　　　1. ecta  english-chinese automation translation  system  1    which processed correctly a science-technologe text cons i s t i n g of 1 words  1 words/sentence in average  1 words/sentence of the longest; with a direct chinese character 
output in june  1. the accuracy was 1% when it dealt with a 1-word a r t i c l e with most errors to be corrected hy s l i g h t l y modifying dictionary or program. the system works in following procedures: 
　　　sentence segmetation -- to segment a sentence according to prpositions  conjunctions  a r t i c l e s or punctuation marks. 
　　　template match -- to match each segment with i t s template and label with feature data. 
　　　segment tree formation -- to l i n k segment with one other and result in a 
　　　tree structure. 
　　　tree scan-to turn out the goal language sentence. 
　　　1. english-chinese t i t l e translation system  1    which could process no leas than 1 metallurgical items with an accuracy of 1$ and a speed of 1 items/ 1min. for the errors oocuriag 1o% was of l e x i c a l nature and easy to eliminate  and the remaining 1% was grammatical. 
　　　1. jf-1  a universal machine transl a t i o n system  1    which could t h e o r e t i cally process any language  if grammars of the two languages to be translated into each other were stored in the system. 
　　　research on natural language understanding is mainly centred on chinese. 
　　　the system rjd-1    developed in the i n s t i t u t e of l i n g u i s t i c s   chinese academy of social sciences  is a t y p i c a l one. it is a qa system run on a small knowledge base of chinese l i t e r a t u r e . in the following are a few t y p i c a l sentences between man and the system-  man;: 


       another sucessful project concerning natural language is the interface for the rice resource retrieval system  which was the system in english eliminating the need for users to memorize long boring string of commands. the system extracts key words and supplemented with syntactic and semantic analysis. at f i r s t   sum up several t y p i c a l questions in r e t r i e v a l 
procedure  for example  find out the value v  of a t t r i b u r e a| corresponding to the value v1 of a t t r i b u t e a1 i . e .   q a  a1 v1 . atn network method is employed in parsing  syntactic analysis  and each node represents a key word. 
       zhejiang university have also developed another similar system  a language interface for warehouse management system. one can inquire the system in any language if the system has been trained beforehand. 
       to understand chinese language by machine  some i n s t i t u t i o n s have set out to explore certain specific methods and fundamental corresponding theory. for instance  qinghua university proposed a 1-level hierarchy structure: sentence-component--structure--word. 
theorem proving 
       prof. wu wenjun  institute of system science  academia sinica  has established a novel approach on the decision problem and the mechanization of theoremproving in elementary geometry. i t s basic idea  restricted to theorems with betweenness out of consideration and based on an entirely different principle  aims at giving a mechanical procedure which permits to prove quite non-trivial theorems in elementaty geometry even by hands. his algorithm has solved certain practical problems that have been hard huts to crach. 
       prof. wang xianghu  j i l i n university  has proposed a generalized resolution principle  i t s basic idea is as follows: in theorea proving the axiom often takes implication form  p- q  r - s   . . .   . while 
	j. xinsong et al. 	1 
turn it into skolem normal form they w i l l take disjunction form  p v q  r v s  . . .   and lose the explicit meaning involved in primitive form. in order to make deduction more effective and natural he suggested to keep the natural form of implication. the clause in natural form is named gerenaliaed clause  corresponding resolution is described as generalized resolotion. he proved that generalized resolution is complete for f i r s t order predicate logic and many improved algorithm  developed in recent years  can be applied to generalized resolution   e.g.  lock resolution  linear resolution  semantic resolution e t c .   . 
expert consulting system 
       by the end of 1's there were only certain small prototype expert systems. after a few year groping and experiences accumulating r & d work on some large practical systems had begun. most of these system. this is resulting from the fact that traditional chinese medicine diagnosis is mainly by experinece  and so to simulate doctors' or physician's diagnosis procedures has aroused a great interests among ai researchs. the f i r s t system of this kind is for hepatitis  developed j o i n t l y by beijing academy of traditional chinese medicine and the institute of automatiion  academia sinica. the fuzzy set theory was applied in the system to make decisions in process of diagnosis. and the program is in basic. this system has been successfully employed in practice  diagnosing dozens patiants a day. 
       anther system of this sort was developred by shanghai institute of computing technology  named general diagnosis system of traditional chinese medicine. the main idea of the system is the concept of  consciousness package . the program are d i v i ded into several small pieces named consciousness package. once a certain condition has been met the corresponding consciousness package would become active. and the package can also be activited by other package. this is a simulation of association thinking of human being. a consciousness package is a basic unit of knowledge. for example  a prescription of chinese herbal medicine may be described as a package in which i t s natures  what kind of disease to be cure  contraindication etc. are involoved. 
       based on similar idea the institute has also developed a control system of blast furnace recertly. as chemical reaction in blast furnace is so complicated that it could not get desired result with 
traditional identification. the system 
adopted a veteran's strategy to control 
some key parameters. and they have achieved

same operating l e v e l as a group c h i e f does w i t h t h i s 	system. 
       there are s t i l l c e r t a i n others o f medical diagnosis system  such as f o r gynaecology diseases developed in j i l i n u n i v e r s i t y . i t diagnosed 1 p a t i e nts w i t h a correctness r a t e of 1. the system is programed in basic  has a 1k main s t o r a g e . the system f o r heart d i s eases  developed in zhongshan u n i v e r s i t y   i t achieved 1$ c o r r e c t diagnosis r a t e . the system f o r n e p h i t i s   developed by 
nanjing technology c o l l e g e   i t provided 1 d i f f e r e n t p r e s c r i p t i o n s from 1 symptoms w i t h a speed of 1 d i a g n o s i s / m i n u t e . there are also system f o r lung d i s ease  p a e d i a t r i c s diseases and other d i s eases. some of these are s t i l l prototype system w h i l e some others have been put i n t o p r a c t i c e . most of them are s i m u l a t i n g a doctor and-supplemented by some math p r o c e s s i n g . some of them are mycin--like system. 
       a group in zhejiang u n i v e r s i t y t r i e d t o t a c k l e c e r t a i n t e c h n i c a l problems i n a g r i c u l t u r e and s i d e l i n e production w i t h expert system  crossbreeding of silkworms is an example. conventional crossbreeding is to s e l e c t parents to generate a h y b r i d 
and then w i t h two new generations h y b r i d ized again to bear sencond generation of h y b r i d and so on. a f t e r several times of h y b r i d i z a t i o n a n i c e v a r i e t y would be y i e l d e d . f o l l o w i n g such a way t h e r e are two major drawbacks: long p e r i o d and low r a t e of success. computer aided crossbreeding system  in which c e r t a i n e x p e r i ences of veteran t e c h n i c i a n s have been embodied  not only s e l e c t s the parents based on knowledge r u l e s but a l s o describes p r o p e r t i e s of new generation beforehand. so t h a t one oould made a comp a r i s i o n choose the best scheme. this system adopts mycin backward m a s o n i n g . 
       zhejiang u n i v e r s i t y a l s o developed systems f o r wheat crossbreeding and d i s i g n i n g p a t t e r n s p r i n t e d o n c l o t h . i n the l a s t system a set of f o r m a l language were adopted to describe p a t t e r n s t r u c t u r e r u l e s . 

whole course. 1$ questions in j u n i o r middle school exercise in math oould be solved w i t h t h i s system and the way is r a t h e r the same as human being does. atep system  capable of s o l v i n g t r i g o n o m e t r i c equations  has solved 1 out of 1 of trigonometry questions appeared in textbook of senior middle s c h o o l . ssh system simul a t e s a student to solve various a p p l i e d a r i t h m e t i c problems.
