　　　i n m i d - f i f t i e s i.m. g e l ' f a n d a n d m.l  t s e t l i n have formulated a hypothesis t h a t complex forms of behaviour observed may be explained by the i n t e g r a t e d act i v i t y of a set of sybsystems  each b e i n s l o c a l by i t s nature and having l i m i ted i n f o r m a t i o n on the task of the whole system. this hypothesis has served as a core f o r a number of c o l l e c t i v e b e h a v i our models in which the r o l e of l o c a l subsystems was played by d e t e r m i n i s t i c or n o n p r o b a b i l i s t i c f i n i t e automata. the choice of such subsystems was d i c t a t e d by the r e s u l t s obtained by m.l. t s e t l i n and his school. they have shown t h a t in a s t a t i o n a r y random array such automata

overall task. 
 fishing  model 
　　　n devoted f i s h i n g fans l i v e in a town. each sunday they take t h e i r f i s h ing-tackle and go out f i s h i n g . the nearest environs of the town have m f i s h ing places but to a l l fishermen's regret m is much less than n. therefore they can never count on loneliness. this makes them hold on to a certain  code of honour : have n people gathered at one place  a l l of t h e i r catch is devided equally among them. the local task of each fisherman is evident  to maximise 
the amount of his catch in a certain t i me interval t  his summer vacation season  f o r example . the town has i t s own task which is to maximise the t o t a l amount of a l l fishermen's catch in a season. in this case the town populations needs for fresh f i s h are met especially 
w e l l . 
     fishing places are not a l l of the same value and characterised by some objective and time invariant parameter pi . this parameter can be treated as the p r o b a b i l i t y of f i s h being found in the i - t h fishing place. but the values of p i are unknown a p r i o r i to fishermen. during the season a l l fishermen accumulate information on the f i s h i n g places. this 
personal individual experience of each of them leads to two individual estimates where i is the number of a f i s h i n g place and j the ordinal number of a fisherman. the estimate or serves f o r approximation of the unknown parameter pi and represents the mean frequency of f i s h to be found in the i - t h fishing place.  approximates the mathematical expectation of the nunjrber of fishermen at the i-th place.  is 
p r a c t i c a l l y calculated as the mean number of fishermen during j - t h fisherman's v i s i t s to the i - t h place. 

　　　to make his decision a fisherman should choose among the f i s h i n g places w i t h a given set of estimates f o r . a l l . f i s h i n g places in the form or it is natural to suppose that a l l entire f i s h i n g places are estimated by the f i s h ermen on a three-stage scale as w e l l : a good place  a poor place and an uncertain place. presenting these estimates in the form of  a set elements the fisherman can estimate the i - t h f i s h i n g place from 
the mapping 	. on obtaining 
the estimates f o r a l l the f i s h i n g places the choice of the next place to go f i s h ing can take into account a l l the places having the highest estimate w i t h equal 
p r o b a b i l i t i e s . the function which implements the mapping o f o n t o l 1 is a usual ternary l o g i c a l function. 
　　　it 	is d i f f i c u l t to imacine that w i t h a larger graduation of estimates f o r and  or f o r the f i s h i n g places nothing 

1 

principally changes but the mapping 1  onto lk which is implemented by a k-
-nary logical function. with the increase of the number of parameters far fishing place estimate  lor instance the distance to a fishing place from the town  the logical function w i l l only have a different number of arguments because with  estimating parameters it w i l l be necessary to organise the mapping of 

     to describe the individual differences of the fishermen one can use the threshold values and the form of the function implement* ing the mapping of l1 onto l1   it can 
be shown that; varying these thresholds is in a certain sence equivalent to varying the form of the mapping function. therefore we shall further assume that the thresholds do not depend on a fisherdan but reflect their consensus on  what's good and what's bad . their i n dividual differences w i l l therefore be determined only by the form of the mapping function. 
     for a  fishing  model it is natural to consider the mapping function to be of conjunctive nature since the fishing 
place estimate depends simultaneously on the estimate of 	and that of 
    the following table shows several functions which can be used as the estimating ones. 
       the function  corresponds to the usual ternary 	conjunction. such f u n c t i on is characteristic of an objective 
fisherman who estimates f i s h i n g places w i t h no emotions or assumptions. the 
functions  be called o p t i mistic. the fishermen using them are apt to consider that  the world is good . with lack of information on something and thus no chance to estimate it the optimists consider such estimate to be a favourable one. the function  is char a c t e r i s t i c of a careful optimist i n c l i n ed to change just one value of 1 f o r 1. under complete uncertainty considers that  every t h i n g w i l l be a l r i g h t   . on 
the contrary  the f u n c t i o n s a n d  are characteristic of the pessemis-
t i c fishermen. they always think that the  world does not love them  and  what good they would see from it   
　　　a f i r s t - r a n k pessimist  or a caref u l one w i t h one uncertain estimate in the set s t i l l dare not substitute it f o r unfavourable but he does it f o r the set  1 1  with out hesitation. whereas a f r a n t i c pessimist replaces a l l estimates of 1 by 1. 
     in computer simulation of the f i s h e r men behaviour a uniform collective was f i r s t considered w i t h the common estimat i n g functions f o r a l l the members of the c o l l e c t i v e . under these conditions the 
 fishing  problem turned into an i n s i g n i -
1 

ficant modification of the well known problem of distribution of automata among feeding-racks* as in the classical approach the process of redistribution of automata among the feeding-racks  fishing places  was established but the rate of reaching the stationary mode of redistribution was greater because of complication of automata behaviour due to the differences of their individual experience.  fishing  is a goor game 
where tne payoffs of the participants depend not on the strategy chosen by some participant   i n our case not on the choise of the place for fishing  but on 
participants' distribution over the possible strategies. introducing into the goor's game the common bank according to which the payoffs of a l l participants are being added up and divided equally among them at each step of the game may help to obtain the maximum of the overa l l payoff for the whole of the collective   i n our case to obtain the over-all towns' goal . 
　　　the disadvantage of common the common bank is the system's central d i s t r i bution  to implement which there should be a special clearing house. for the  fishing  model this means that a l l the fishermen should deliver their catch of the day to one center wherefrom they receive an n -th part of the overall catch in return. 
　　　introduction of nonuniformity has helped to do. without such central distribution body. let us consider the results of a simulation experiment. during it an additional assumption was made that the choice of the fishing place with no f i s h gives a fisherman a constant loss reducing his mean income collected on the previous days of the season. besides a certain threshold was assumed to exist  exceeding this by the amount of catch gives a fisherman some income proportional to this excess. with the 

　　　for a uniform collective consisting exclusively of objective fishermen or frantic optimists the mean input of each member was 1 conditional units after the setting of redistribution process. the uniform collective consisting of frantic pessimists managed to get an i n come of 1 units. all other uniform collectives obtained worse results in comparison with these f i r s t . mixed collectives in a number of cases showed much better results. an experimentally composed collective of 1 first-rank pessimists  careful ones  and 1 objectivists could gain a mean income of 1 units which corresponds to the maximal possible mean input in this game. 
　　study with different parameters and estimating functions  e.g. disjunctive  has shown that a nonuniform collective 
providing a global income with the help of a common bank procedure can always be composed. 
     the  fishing  model is easily transformed into various models or decentralised resource allocation or into the models of the bulk service or queueing theory. 
the  neighbours  model 
　　　in a droughty place some country cottages are located round the boot of a h i l l . there is a water source on the h i l l which can be quite sufficient with reasonable distribution of watering time among the cottage tenants. but in this problem the tenants do not wish or just cannot arrange such a reasonable timetable. they simply do not seek any kind of contacts most probably considering it to be the best way of keeping neighbourly. the low fences between cottages allow 

1 

each tenant to watch the others and thus adjust his own watering activity. for 
purposeful use of the water supply it is necessary that only one half of the cottage ground be watered at a time. whenever more than a half the tenants open the water a certain number of grounds are being automatically switched off from water supply. 
     to put things in order the water supply service has decided that a l l the tenants whose cottages have even numbers should water their grounds before the noon  and a l l the rest  after the noon. but the cottage tenants would not obey this order of the water supply servicethen it was desided that a l l the tenants violating the order should be fined with switching ofi' their grounds from water supply for a certain time period. after several fines they stopped supplying such cottage ground with water at a l l . 
     a natural question is: can these codditions and such a technique enforce order in water supply and not ruin any of the cottage grounds by leaving it without water. 
　　let us formulate the problems in a more formal way. there is a chain of 1n automata connected in a ring. each automaton has information on its closer neighbours' states. there are only two such states  1 and 1. the collective's task is to transform the automata into the states  forming a sequence of a1  

task of any of them is to minimise the overall fine for exceeding a certain 
fine threshold with its overall fine results in the automaton. 
     at each cycle the automaton may choose one of the two possible actions corresponding to the choise of this or that state. in the simplest case this choice is made through the analysis of the neighbour automata states at a tine neglecting the past history of the auto-
maton. this choice is made using the betow following table. when the choice is not single-valued the automaton chooses either state with equal probability. the i n i t i a l state distribution is given at 
random. the question of setting the necessary order in such a collective may 
be answered analytically through the analysis of the i n i t i a l situation. in order to avoid bulky computations of the corresponding markov system states one can simulate the problem on a computer. as a result not a very consoling fact would emerge that the system of this kind almost never settle in a desired way. the model may be slightly improved by introducing the fines received from the environment  the water supply service . if after the automaton has made its choice situation 1 or 1 arises  
the automaton is fined. after a certain number of fines it is switched off and 
1 

its state kept fixed during the subsequent cycles. but even after that the 
whole system does not work very satisfactory. 
　　let us introduce the nonuniformity into the automata collective under study 
using the concept of reflection ranks  thoroughly analysed in  by v.a. lefevre. following this concept let us inductively introduce the reflection 
rank for the automata in our model. we shall consider the automaton to have a reflection rank of zero if its functioning is completely defined by the above mentioned system state table. the automaton's reflection rank is taken for 1 when it works in the following way. first it watches the neighbouring automata change their states and then chooses its own state through forecasting its neighbours' behaviour. in general we shall say that the automaton has a reflection rank equal to  if it considers his neighbours to be automata with reflection ranks equal to 
     the increase of the reflection rank in our model results from the increase of the amount of information coaming at the input of the automaton under study. the automaton with zero reflection is only informed of the states of his nearest neighbours. the automaton with a ref-
lection rank of 1 should possess the i n formation on the states of both two of his righthand and two of his lefthand neighbours. the automaton with a reflection rank of  should use the information on the states of  neighbouring automata  both righthand and lefthand. 
　　　two models may be studied. the f i r s t does not chance the automata reflection ranks in the process of their functioning. the second may change the automata 
reflection rank by the fining signals from the environment. the f i r s t model appears to be greatly dependent on the random reflection rank distribution over the automata collective. to solve our problem of the automata collective's achieving the sequence of states of 	it is roost desirable to 
have the reflection ranks of 1 and 1 distributed among the automata in the same order. in this case with any d i s t ribution of the i n i t i a l states over it the collective s t i l l comes into the desired global point. 
　　　the second-type model always solves the problem providing that one may use zero and f i r s t rank reflections. use of other reflections does not always bring the desired results to the collective. the collective having automata with zero and second rank reflection behaves in a less purposeful way than a uniform collective with zero reflection. for the f i r s t type model one may show such a reflection rank distribution among the automata which zeroes the collective into the desired point. 
　　we shall postpone until a l i t t l e l a t er the discussion or the results obtained from the  neighbours  model and now 
switch over to one which is a direct generalisation of i t . 
the  pattern  model 
     let the automata now be located not in the form of a ring  as in the  neighbours  model  but f i l l in some tore. let us consider that each of the automata with zero rank reflection has eight neighbours the complete information of the states of which is available at any time.  again we assume that there are only two states  1 and 1 . the automata collective's task is to design a certain pattern on the tore defined by its elementary part being represented by a 1 x 1 matrix. this matrix is known to the automata. each automaton's task is to choose a state that would allow it and its eight neighbours to design a pattern after the model known. the i n i t i a l 
automata states at the tore are taken arbitrarily. 

1 

　　　the direct generalisation of the  neighbours  model for the tore is the model where the automata should design a chess-board pattern. the algorithm of each automatons work is defined as f o l lows. the automaton compares its own state with that of the central square of the model matrix. after that it counts up the number of its neighbours with the states differing from those of the model matrix. the automaton changes its state 
with a probability proportional to this overall number. 
     the computer simulation made by ye.t. semionova has shown that the uniformity of a collective led to obtaining only the simplest patterns line those of a chess-board  or of horizontal and v e r t i cal stripes. more complicated patterns  
for instance  the one given by a matrix 

are not obtain-
able. but the introduction of the nonunformity over the reflection ranks both in the  neighbours  and in the 'patthrn  
models has resulted in obtaining p r a c t i cally any kind of patterns given by a 1 x 1 matrix. 
conclusions 
　　a l l above allows making important conclusions on the advantages of a nonuniform collective of automata when solving many practical problems. the prob-
lems of the  fishing  type were already mentioned. the  neighbours  and  pattern  type models can easily be transformed into many models having great importance when applied to constructing the uniform arrays and most probably in biological and microbiological models. sociological analogues of the models considered are also easy to be shown. 
     another conclusion is that the contr o l in nonuniform collectives is most effective when the control over the entire distribution of this nonuniformity is possible. notice that in performing creative tasks animals and people should adapt to the environment obtaining from it the necessary control for a nonuni-
 form collective  see  for instance       . 
　　　all this shows the models of collective behaviour of the nonuniform community to be of greater interest for a l l the scientists engaded in any way in solving the problems of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence for a collective of i n d i v i -
duals.
