
we study fair division of indivisible goods among agents from the point of view of compact representation and computational complexity. we identify the complexity of several problems  including that of deciding whether there exists an efficient and envy-free allocation when preferences are represented in a succinct way. we also draw connections to nonmonotonic reasoning.
1 introduction
allocation of goods among agents has been considered from different perspectives in social choice theory and ai. in this paper we focus on fair division of indivisible goods without money transfers. fair division makes a prominent use of fairness criteria such as equity and envy-freeness  and on this point totally depart from auctions  where only efficiency is relevant  and moreover a specific form of efficiency  since the criterion to be maximized is the total revenue of the auctioneer . envy-freeness is a key concept in the literature on fair division: an allocation is envy-free if and only if each agent likes her share at least as much as the share of any other agent. ensuring envy-freeness is considered as crucial; however  envy-freeness alone does not suffice as a criterion for finding satisfactory allocations  therefore it has to be paired with some efficiency criterion  such as pareto optimality. however  it is known that for any reasonable notion of efficiency  there are profiles for which no efficient and envyfree allocation exists  see  brams et al.  1  1.
¡¡whereas social choice theory has developed an important literature on fair division  computational issues have rarely been considered. on the other hand  artificial intelligence has studied these issues extensively  but until now has focused mainly on combinatorial auctions and related problems  investigating issues such as compact representation as well as complexity and algorithms. complexity issues for negotiation  where agents exchange goods by means of deals  have also been studied  e.g.  dunne et al.  1; chevaleyre et al.  1  . see also  bouveret et al.  1  for a preliminary complexity study of fair division problems.
¡¡the above discussion reveals the existence of a gap: compact representation and complexity issues for fair division have received very little attention until now  apart of the recent work  lipton et al.  1  which studies approximation schemes for envy-freeness. the need for compact representation arises from the following dilemna  formulated by several social choice theorists: either  a  allow agents to express any possible preference relation on the set of all subsets of items  and end up with an exponentially large representation  such as in  herreiner and puppe  1  ; or  b  severely restrict the set of expressible preferences  typically by assuming additive independence between items  and then design procedures where agents express preferences between single items  thus giving up the possibility of expressing preferential dependencies such as complementarity and substitutability effects among items; this is the path followed by  brams et al.  1  and  demko and hill  1 . yet  as we advocate in this paper  conciliating conciseness and expressivity is possible  by means of compact representation.
¡¡as in most works on fair allocation of indivisible items we focus on the joint search for envy-freeness and efficiency. the impossibility to guarantee the existence of an efficient envy-free allocation implies that determining whether there exists such an allocation is a crucial task  since a positive answer leads to choose such an allocation whereas a negative answer calls for a relaxation of one of the criteria. we consider this problem from the point of view of compact representation and computational complexity. we focus first in the simple case where agents have dichotomous preferences  that is  they simply express a partition between satisfactory and unsatisfactory shares. the interest of such a restriction is that in spite of the expressivity loss it imposes  it will be shown to be no less complex than the general case  while being much simpler to expose. the most natural representation of a dichotomous preference is by a single propositional formula  where variables correspond to goods. expressing envy-freenessandefficiencywithin this logical representation reveals unexpected connections to nonmonotonic reasoning. we identify the complexity of the key problem of the existence of an envy-free and pareto-efficient allocation  which turns out to be ¦²p1-complete; we also identify the complexity of several other problems obtained either by imposing some restrictions on the latter or by replacing pareto-efficiency by other criteria. in section 1 we extend this result to the case of non-dichotomous  compactly represented preferences.
1 background
1 fair division problems
definition 1
a fair division problem is a tuple p = hi x ri where
  i = {1 ... n} is a set of agents;
  x = {x1 ... xp} is a set of indivisible goods;
  r = hr1 ... rni is a preference profile  where each ri is a reflexive  transitive and complete relation on 1x.
¡¡ri is the preference relation of agent i. arib is alternatively denoted by ri a b  or by; we note a  i b  strict preference  for and not b  indifference  for.
¡¡in addition  ri is said to be monotonous if and only if for all a b  a   b   x implies is monotonous if and only if ri is monotonous for every i.
definition 1
  an allocation for p = hi x ri is a mapping ¦Ð : i ¡ú
1x such that for all i and j 1= i  ¦Ð i  ¡É ¦Ð j  =  . if for every x ¡Ê x there exists a i such that x ¡Ê ¦Ð i  then ¦Ð is a complete allocation.
  let ¦Ð ¦Ð¡ä two allocations. ¦Ð dominates ¦Ð¡ä if and only if
 a  for all and  b  there exists an i such that ¦Ð i   i ¦Ð¡ä i . ¦Ð is  pareto-  efficient if and only if there is no ¦Ð¡ä such that ¦Ð¡ä dominates ¦Ð.
  an allocation ¦Ð is envy-free if and only if holds for all i and all j 1= i.
1 propositional logic
let v be a finite set of propositional variables. lv is the propositional language generated from v   the usual connectives    ¡Ä and ¡Å and the boolean constants   and ¡Í in the usual way1. an interpretation m for lv is an element of 1v   i.e.  a truth assignment to symbols: for all x ¡Ê v   x ¡Ê m  resp. x ¡Ê1 m  means that m assigns x to true  resp. to false . mod    = {m ¡Ê 1v | m |=  } is the set of all models of    the satisfaction relation |= is defined as usual  as well as satisfiability and logical consequence .
¡¡a literal is a formulaof lv of the form x or of the form x  where x ¡Ê v . a formula   is under negative normal form  or nnf  if and only if any negation symbol in   appears only in literals. any formula can be turned in polynomial time into an equivalent nnf formula. for instance  a ¡Ä   b ¡Ä c  is not undernnf but is equivalentto the nnf formulaa¡Ä  b¡Å c .
¡¡a formula is positive if it contains no occurrence of the negation symbol. for instance  a¡Ä b¡Å c  and a¡Å  a¡Äb  are not positive  whereas a¡Ä b¡Åc  and  a¡Äc ¡Å a¡Äb  are.   and ¡Í are considered positive as well.
¡¡let   ¡Ê lv . v ar      v is the set of propositional variables appearing in  . for instance  v ar  a ¡Ä c  ¡Å  a ¡Ä b   = {a b c} and v ar    =  .
¡¡lastly  if s = { 1 ...  n} is a finite set of formulas then vs =  1 ¡Ä ... ¡Ä  n is the conjunction of all formulas of s.
1 computational complexity
in this paper we will refer to some complexity classes located in the polynomial hierarchy. we assume the reader to be familiar with the classes np and conp. bh1 also referred to as dp  is the class of all languages of the form l1 ¡É l1 where l1 is in np and l1 in conp. pnp is the class of all languages recognizable by a deterministic turing machine workingin polynomialtime using np oracles. likewise  ¦²p1=
npnp. ¦¨p1 =  p1 o logn   is the subclass of  p1 of problems that only need a logarithmic number of oracles. see for instance  papadimitriou  1  for further details.
1 fair division problems with dichotomous preferences: logical representation
we start by considering in full detail the case where preferences are dichotomous.
definition 1 ri is dichotomous if and only if there exists a subset goodi of 1x such that for all and only if a ¡Ê goodi or b ¡Ê1 goodi. r = hr1 ... rni is dichotomous if and only if every ri is dichotomous.
¡¡there is an obvious way of representing dichotomous preferences compactly  namely by a propositional formula  i  for each agent i  of the language lx  a propositionalsymbols for each good  such that mod    = goodi. formally:
definition 1 let ri be a dichotomouspreference on 1x  with goodi its associated subset of 1x  and  i a propositional formula on the propositional language lx. we say that  i represents ri if and only if mod  i  = goodi.
¡¡clearly  for any dichotomous preference ri there is a formula  i representing ri; furthermore  this formula is unique up to logical equivalence.
example 1 x = {a b c} and goodi = {{a b} {b c}}. note that ri is not monotonous. then  i =  a ¡Ä b ¡Ä  c  ¡Å   a ¡Ä b ¡Ä c  represents ri.
an easy but yet useful result  whose proof is omitted :
proposition 1 let ri be a dichotomous preference on 1x. the following statements are equivalent:
1. ri is monotonous;
1. goodi is upward closed  that is  a ¡Ê goodi and b   a imply b ¡Ê goodi.
1. ri is representable by a positive propositional formula.
¡¡from now on  we assume that allocation problems p are represented in propositional form  namely  instead of i  x and r we only specify h 1 ...  ni. i and x are obviously determined from h 1 ...  ni.
¡¡let p = h 1 ...  ni be an allocation problem with dichotomous preferences; then for each i ¡Ü n  we rewrite  i into   i obtained from  i by replacing every variable x  by the new symbol	and  1 = a ¡Ä 1 .
¡¡for all i ¡Ü n  let xi = {xi x ¡Ê x} an allocation for a standard allocation problem p corresponds to a model of v = x1¡È...¡Èxn satisfying at most one xi for each x ¡Ê x. in other terms  there is a bijective mapping between the set of possible allocations and the models of the following formula ¦£p = vx¡Êx vi1=j   xi ¡Ä xj 
if allocation are required to be complete  then ¦£p is replaced by . the rest in unchanged.
¡¡let v = {xi | i = 1 ... n  x ¡Ê x}. any interpretation m of mod ¦£p  is such that it is never the case that xi and xj are simultaneously true for i 1= j  therefore we can map m ¡Ê mod ¦£p  to an allocation f ¦Ð  = m simply defined by ¦Ð i  = {x | m |= xi}. this mapping is obviously bijective  and we denote f 1 m  the allocation corresponding to an interpretation m of mod ¦£p .
1 envy-freeness
we now show how the search for an envy-free allocation can be mapped to a satisfiability problem. let   j|i be the formula obtained from   i by substituting every symbol xi in   i by xj: for instance  if   1 = a1 ¡Ä  b1 ¡Å c1  then  b1 ¡Å c1 .  obviously 
proposition 1 let p = h 1 ...  ni be an allocation problem with dichotomous preferences under propositional form  and the formulas and mapping f as defined above. let

then ¦Ð is envy-free if and only if f ¦Ð  |= ¦«p.
¡¡the proof is simple  so we omit it. the search for envy-free allocations can thus be reduced to a satisfiability problem: {f 1 m |m |= ¦£p ¡Ä¦«p} is the set of envy-freeallocations for p note that  importantly  ¦£p ¡Ä¦«p has a polynomial size  precisely  quadratic  in the size of the input data.
example 1  1 = a ¡Å  b ¡Ä c ;  1 = a;  1 = a ¡Å b.
¦«p =   a1¡Å b1¡Äc1  ¡Å   a1¡Å b1¡Äc1  ¡Ä  a1¡Å b1¡Äc1    ¡Ä a1¡Å  a1¡Ä a1  ¡Ä  a1¡Å b1 ¡Å   a1 ¡Å b1 ¡Ä  a1¡Å b1  ; mod ¦£p ¡Ä¦«p  = {{c1} {c1 b1} {c1 b1} {c1} {b1} {c1}  }.
there are therefore 1 envy-free allocations  namely  c        c   b      c b      c          b        c  and        . note that none of them is complete.
1 efficient allocations
definition 1 let   = {¦Á1 ... ¦Ám} a set of formulae and ¦Â a formula. s     is a maximal ¦Â-consistent subset of   iff  a  vs ¡Ä¦Â is consistent and  b  there is no s¡ä such that s   s¡ä     and vs¡ä ¡Ä ¦Â is consistent. let maxcons   ¦Â  be the set of all maximal ¦Â-consistent subsets of  .
proposition 1 let p = h 1 ...  ni an allocation problem. let is efficient for p if and only if {  i | f ¦Ð  |=   i } is a maximal ¦£p-consistent subset of ¦µp.
¡¡this simple result  whose proofis omitted  suggests that efficient allocations can be computed from the logical expression ¦µ of the problem  namely  by computing the maximal ¦£p-consistent subsets of ¦µ; call them {s1 ... sq}. then for each.
then f 1 m  is the set of all efficient allocations for ¦µ1.
example 1  cont'd 	the maximal ¦£p-consistent subsets of
.
vs1 ¡Ä ¦£p has only one model: {b1 c1 a1}. vs1 ¡Ä ¦£p has two models: {a1 b1} and {b1 c1 a1}. vs1 ¡Ä ¦£p has one model: {a1 b1}. therefore the four efficient allocations for p are  bc a      a   b    bc   a  and    a b . none of them is envy-free.
1 efficient and envy-free allocations
we are now in position of putting things together. since envy-free allocations corresponds to the models of ¦«p and efficient allocations to the models of maximal ¦£p-consistent subsets of ¦µp  the existence of an efficient and envy-free  eef  allocation is equivalent to the following condition: there exists a maximal ¦£p-consistent subset s of ¦µp such that vs ¡Ä ¦£p ¡Ä ¦«p is consistent. in this case  the models of the latter formula are the eef allocations. interestingly  this is an instance of a well-known problem in nonmonotonic reasoning:
definition 1 a supernormal default theory1 is a pair d = h¦Â  i with   = {¦Á1 ... ¦Ám}  where ¦Á1 ... ¦Ám and ¦Â are propositional formulas. a propositional formula ¦× is a skeptical consequence of d  denoted by d |¡«  ¦×  if and only if for all s ¡Ê maxcons   ¦Â  we have vs ¡Ä ¦Â |= ¦×.
proposition 1 let p = h 1 ...  ni a fair division problem. let dp = h¦£p ¦µpi. then there exists an efficient and envy-free allocation for p if and only if d |¡«1    ¦«p.
¡¡this somewhat unexpected connection to nonmonotonic reasoning has several implications. first  eef allocations correspond to the models of vs ¡Ä ¦£p ¡Ä ¦«p for s ¡Ê maxcons ¦µp ¦£p ; however  maxcons ¦µp ¦£p  may be exponentially large  which argues for avoiding to start computing efficient allocations and then filtering out those that are not envy-free  but rather compute eef allocations in a single step  using default reasoning algorithms thus  fair division may benefit from computational work in default logic and connex domains such as belief revision and answer set programming. moreover  alternative criteria for selecting extensions in default reasoning  such as cardinality  weights or priorities  correspond to alternative efficiency criteria in allocation problems.
1 allocation problems with dichotomous preferences: complexity
it is known that skeptical inference is ¦°p1-complete  gottlob  1 ; now  after proposition 1  the problem of the existence of an eef allocation can be reduced to the complement of a skeptical inference problem  which immediately tells that it

allocations . this can be tempered by  a  there are many practical cases where the number of maximal consistent subsets is small;  b  it is generally not asked to look for all efficient allocations; if we look for just one  then this can be done by computing one maximal ¦£p-consistent subset of ¦µ.
1
¡¡¡¡ supernormal  defaults are also called  normal defaults without prerequisites   e.g.   reiter  1  .
. less obviously  we now show that it is complete for this class  even if preferences are required to be monotonous.
¡¡let us first note that skeptical inference remains ¦°p1complete under these two restrictions  to which we refer as
rsi  for restricted skeptical inference :  a  ¦× =  1;  b  n ¡Ý 1.  here is the justification:   |¡« ¦× if and only if   ¡È {¦× ¦×} |¡« ¦×.  equivalently  rsi is the problem of deciding whether  given   = h¦Á1 ... ¦Áni with n ¡Ý 1  all maximal consistent subsets of   contain ¦Á1.
proposition 1 the problem eef existence of determining whether there exists an efficient and envy-free allocation for a given problem p with monotonous  dichotomous preferences under logical form is ¦²p1-complete.

¡¡we show hardness by the following reduction from rsi  the complement problem of rsi  to eef existence. given any finite set   of propositional formulae  let v  = v ar    the set of propositional symbols appearing in    and let p = h    the following instance of eef existence:
 1  i = {1 ... n + 1};
x = {vi|v ¡Ê v  i ¡Ê 1...n} ¡È {v¡¥i|v ¡Ê v  i ¡Ê 1...n}
;
 1  for each i = 1 ... n  let ¦Âi be obtained from ¦Ái by the following sequence of operations:  i  put ¦Ái into nnf form  let ¦Á¡äi be the result ;  b  for every v ¡Ê v   replace  in ¦Á¡äi  each  positive  occurrence of v by vi and each occurrence of  v by v¡¥i; let ¦Âi be the formula obtained. then
   1 = ¦Â1 ¡Å x1;
  for i = 1 ... n   i = ¦Âi ¡Ä xi;

   n+1 = y.
lemma 1 an allocation ¦Ð for p is said to be regular if and only if for all i 1= n  ¦Ð i    ¦Ò i   where
  for all;
  ¦Ò n + 1  = sv¡Êv  i=1 ... n{vi v¡¥i}s{x1 y};
  ¦Ò n + 1  = {y}.
let now ¦Ðr defined by ¦Ðr i  = ¦Ð i  ¡É ¦Òi. then
1. ¦Ðr is regular;
1. ¦Ð is efficient if and only if ¦Ðr is is efficient;
1. if ¦Ð is envy-free then ¦Ðr is is envy-free.
proof:  1  is obvious. for all i  the goods outside ¦Ò i  do not have any influence on the satisfaction of i  since they do not appear in ¦Ái   therefore ¦Ðr i  ¡«i ¦Ð i   from which  1  follows. the formulas ¦Ái being positive  the preference relations i are monotonous  therefore holds for all i j. now  if ¦Ð is envy-free then for all i  j we have
  therefore
and ¦Ðr is envy-free  from which  1  follows.	
lemma 1 if ¦Ð is regular then
1. 1 can only envy n + 1;
1. 1 ... n envy noone;
1. n + 1 can only envy n + 1;
1. n + 1 can only envy n + 1;
proof: first  note that for any i  j 1= i  i envies j if and only if ¦Ð i  |=   i and ¦Ð j  |=  i.
1. let i = 1 and j ¡Ê {1 ... n n + 1}. assume 1 envies j. then ¦Ð j  |=  1. ¦Ð being regular  x1¡Ê ¦Ð j   therefore ¦Ð j  |= ¦Â1. now  since ¦Ð is regular  ¦Ð j  does not contain any vi nor any v¡¥i; now  ¦Â1 can only be made true by variables vi or v¡¥i  which cannot be the case here  unless it is a tautology. now  if ¦Â1 is a tautology  then 1 is satisfied by ¦Ð and cannot envy j  a contradiction.
1. let i ¡Ê {1 ... n} and j 1= i. if i envies j then ¦Ð j  |= ¦Âi ¡Ä xi  which is impossible because xi 1¡Ê ¦Ð j   due to the regularity of ¦Ð.
1. let i = n + 1. assume n + 1 envies 1 then ¦Ð 1  |=  n+1.
since ¦Ð 1  |= y is impossible  because ¦Ð is regular   we have
  which implies that either.
both are impossible because ¦Ð is regular and n ¡Ý 1. the case j ¡Ê {1 ... n} is similar.
1. let i = n + 1 and j 1= n. if i envies j then ¦Ð j  |= y  which is impossible because ¦Ð is regular. 
lemma 1 let ¦Ð be a regular allocation satisfying n + 1 and n + 1. let m ¦Ð  be the interpretation on v  obtained from ¦Ð by: for all v ¡Ê v   m ¦Ð  |= v  i.e.  v ¡Ê m ¦Ð   if n + 1 receives v¡¥1 ... v¡¥n  and m ¦Ð  |=  v otherwise  i.e.  if n+1 receives v1 ... vn. then ¦Ð is envy-free iff m ¦Ð  |= ¦Á1.
proof: let ¦Ð be a regular allocation satisfying n + 1 and n + 1. since ¦Ð satisfies n + 1  y ¡Ê ¦Ð n + 1 . now  ¦Ð satisfies n + 1 without giving him y  therefore  for any v  n + 1 receives either all the vi's or all the v¡¥i's. this shows that our definition of m ¦Ð  is well-founded. now  since ¦Ð is regular  it is envy-free if and only if  a  1 does not envy n+1   b  n+1 does not envy n+1 and  c  n+1 does not envy n+1. since n + 1 and n + 1 are satisfied by ¦Ð  we get that ¦Ð is envy-free if and only if 1 does not envy n+1  that is  if and only if either ¦Ð 1  |=  1 or ¦Ð n + 1  |1=  1. now  ¦Ð n + 1  contains x1  therefore ¦Ð n + 1  |=  1  which entails that ¦Ð is envy-free if and only if ¦Ð 1  |=  1. this is equivalent to ¦Ð 1  |= ¦Â1  because 1 does not get x1  which is assigned to n+1   which in turn is equivalentto m ¦Ð  by construction. 
lemma 1 for each interpretation m over v   let us define ¦Ðm : i ¡ú 1x by:
  ¦Ðm 1  = {v1 | m |= v} ¡È {v¡¥1 | m |=  v};
  for each i ¡Ê 1 ... n  ¦Ðm i  = {vi | m |= v} ¡È {v¡¥i | m |=  v} ¡È {xi};
  ¦Ðm n + 1  = {x1} ¡È {v¡¥i | m |= v i = 1 ... n} ¡È
{vi | m |=  v i = 1 ... n};
  ¦Ðm n + 1  = {y}
then:
1. ¦Ðm is a well-defined and regular allocation satisfying n + 1 and n + 1;
1. m¦Ðm = m  m¦Ðm is obtained from ¦Ðm as in lemma1 .
1. for any i ¡Ê 1 ... n  ¦Ðm satisfies i iff m |= ¦Ái.
1. ¦Ðm is efficient iff m satisfies a maximal consistent subset of  .
proof:
1. ¦Ðm does not give the same good to more than one individual  therefore it is an allocation. the rest is straightforward.
1. if m |= v then ¦Ðm n + 1  contains {v¡¥i | i = 1 ... n} and therefore m ¦Ðm  |= v. the case m |=  v is similar.
1. let i ¡Ê 1 ... n. since ¦Ðm gives xi to i  ¦Ðm satisfies i if and only if ¦Ðm i  |= ¦Âi  which is equivalent to m |= ¦Ái. if i = 1 then  since ¦Ðm does not give x1 to 1  ¦Ðm satisfies 1 if and only if ¦Ðm 1  |= ¦Â1  which is equivalent to m |= ¦Á1.
1. from point 1  {i ¦Ðmsatisfiesi} = {i m |= ¦Ái}. now  since preferences are dichotomous  an allocation ¦Ð is efficient if and only if the set of individuals it satisfies is maximal with respect to inclusion. therefore  ¦Ðm is efficient if and only if m satisfies a maximal consistent subset of  . 
lemma 1 let ¦Ð be a regular and efficient allocation satisfying n+1 and n+1. then m ¦Ð  satisfies a maximal consistent subset of  .
proof: ¦Ð is regular and satisfies n + 1 and n + 1  therefore ¦Ð n + 1  = {y}  x1 ¡Ê ¦Ð n + 1   and m ¦Ð  is well-defined.
let ¦Ð¡ä obtained from ¦Ð by
  ¦Ð¡ä 1  = {v1|m ¦Ð  |= v} ¡È {v¡¥1|m ¦Ð  |=  v};
  for each i = 1 ... n: ¦Ð¡ä i  = {vi|m ¦Ð  |= v} ¡È {v¡¥i|m ¦Ð  |=  v} ¡È {xi};
  ¦Ð¡ä n+1  = {x1}¡È{vi|m ¦Ð  |=  v}¡È{v¡¥i|m ¦Ð  |= v};
  ¦Ð¡ä n + 1  = {y}.
¦Ð being regular and satisfying n + 1 and n + 1  we have ¦Ð n + 1  = ¦Ð¡ä n + 1   ¦Ð n + 1  = ¦Ð¡ä n + 1   and then for each i  ¦Ð i    ¦Ð¡ä i : indeed  let j ¡Ê {1 ... n}  for n + 1 and n + 1 this inclusion is obviously satisfied ; then  a  ¦Ð is regular  therefore ¦Ð j    ¦Ò j ; now  all goods of ¦Ò j  are either in ¦Ð¡ä j  or in ¦Ð n + 1   namely: x1 if j = 1 and all the vj such that m ¦Ð  |=  v and all the v¡¥j such that m ¦Ð  |= v ; therefore  ¦Ð j    ¦Ð¡ä j  ¡È ¦Ð n + 1   which  together with ¦Ð 1  ¡É ¦Ð n + 1  =    implies ¦Ð j    ¦Ð¡ä j . since preferences are monotonous  all individuals satisfied by ¦Ð are satisfied by ¦Ð¡ä as well; and since ¦Ð is efficient  ¦Ð and ¦Ð¡ä satisfy the same set of individuals. now  we remark that ¦Ð¡ä = ¦Ðm ¦Ð . by lemma 1  ¦Ð¡ä is efficient iff m ¦Ð  satisfies a maximal consistent subset of    from which we conclude. 
lemma 1 any envy-free and efficient allocation for p satifies n + 1 and n + 1.
proof: suppose ¦Ð doesn't satisfy n + 1; then y 1¡Ê ¦Ð n + 1 ; now  if y ¡Ê ¦Ð n+1  then n+1 envies n+1; if y 1¡Ê ¦Ð n+1  then ¦Ð is not efficient because giving y to n+1 would satisfy n + 1 and thus lead to a better allocation than ¦Ð.
now  suppose ¦Ð does not satisfy n + 1  i.e.  y 1¡Ê ¦Ð n + 1 ; if y ¡Ê ¦Ð n + 1  then n + 1 envies n + 1; if y 1¡Ê ¦Ð n + 1  then again  ¦Ð is not efficient because giving y to n + 1 would satisfy n + 1 and thus lead to a better allocation than ¦Ð. 
lemma 1 if there exists an eef allocation  then there exists a maximal consistent subset of   containing ¦Á1.
proof: let ¦Ð be an efficient and envy-free allocation. by lemma 1  ¦Ðr is regular  efficient and envy-free. by lemma 1  ¦Ðr satisfies n + 1 and n + 1. then by lemma 1  m ¦Ðr  satisfies a maximal consistent subset of    and by lemma 1  m ¦Ðr  |= ¦Á1. therefore sat m ¦Ðr     is a maximal consistent subset of   and contains ¦Á1. 
lemma 1 if there exists a maximal consistent subset of   containing ¦Á1 then there exists an eef allocation.
proof: assume that there exists a maximal consistent subset s of   containing ¦Á1  and let m be a model of s. by point 1 of lemma 1  ¦Ðm is efficient.
by point 1 of lemma 1  ¦Ðm is regular; then by lemma 1  ¦Ðm is envy-free if and only if  i  1 does not envy n + 1   ii  n + 1 does not envy n + 1 and  iii  n + 1 does not envy n+1. by point 1 of lemma 1  ¦Ðm satisfies n+1 and n +1  therefore  ii  and  iii  hold. lastly  by point 1 of lemma 1  m |= ¦Á1 implies that ¦Ðm satisfies 1  therefore  i  holds as well and ¦Ðm is envy-free.	
proof of proposition 1: from lemmas 1 and 1  the existence of a maximal consistent subset of   containing ¦Á1 and the existence of an efficient and envy-free allocation for p = h    are equivalent. clearly  h is computed in polynomial time. therefore  h is a polynomial reduction

from rsi to eef existence  which shows that the latter problem is -hard  and therefore -complete. 
¡¡as a corollary  this -completeness result holds for general  not necessarily monotonous  dichotomous preferences.
¡¡as a consequenceof this high complexity it is worth studying restrictions and variants of the latter problem for which complexity may fall down. we start by considering identical dichotomous preference profiles  that is  all agents have the same preference  i.e. the same formula  .
proposition 1 eef existence with n identical dichotomous  monotonous preferences is np-complete  for any fixed
n ¡Ý 1.
¡¡due to space limitations the proofs of this result and the following ones are omitted1. note that we have here a hardness result for any fixed number of agents  ¡Ý 1 . things are different with proposition 1  for which hardness does not hold when n is fixed. namely  the following holds for n = 1:
proposition 1 eef existence for two agents with monotonous dichotomous preferences is np-complete.
¡¡unlike proposition 1  these results are sensitive to whether preferences are required to be monotonous or not.
proposition 1 eef existence with n identical dichotomous preferences is cobh1-complete  for any fixed n ¡Ý 1.
proposition 1 eef existence for 1 agents with dichotomous preferences is cobh1-complete.
complexity decreases as well if we weaken pareto-efficiency by only requiring allocations to be complete:
proposition 1 the existence of a complete envy-free allocation for agents with monotonous  dichotomous preferences is np-complete  even for 1 agents with identical preferences.
lastly  replacingpareto-efficiencyby an utilitarianistic notion of efficiency results in a complexity decrease as well:
proposition 1 the existence of an envy-free allocation satisfying a maximal number of agents with monotonous dichotomous preferences is -complete.
1 non-dichotomous preferences
we now consider the case where preferences are no longer dichotomous. again  since an explicit description of preferences is exponentially large  the need for a compact description thereof is clear. many languages exist for succinct representation of preference. however  proposition 1 extends to any language  provided that  a  it extends propositional logic  i.e.  it is able to express compactly any dichotomous preference represented by a propositional formula;  b  comparing two sets of goods can be done in polynomial time. conditions  a  and  b  are met by many languages for succinct representation of preference1. under assumptions  a  and  b :
corollary 1 eef existence with monotonous preference under logical form is -complete.
¡¡for the latter result preferences do not have to be numerical since pareto efficiency and envy-freeness are purely ordinal notions. now  if preferences are numerical  which implies the possibility of intercomparing and aggregating preferences of several agents  then  besides pareto-efficiency  we may consider efficiency based on social welfare functions. we consider here only the two most classical way of aggregating a collection of utility functions hu1 ... uni into a social welfare function sw: utilitarianism  sw = pi ui  and egalitarianism  sw = mini ui .
proposition 1 given a collection of utility functions on 1r given in compact form:
  the problem of the existence of an envy-free allocation maximizing utilitarian social welfare is  p1-complete  even if n = 1.
  the problem of the existence of an envy-free allocation maximizing egalitarian social welfare is -complete  even if n = 1.
¡¡a last case that has not been considered is the case of additive numerical preferences. in the latter case  the utility function of agent i ¡Ü n is simply expressed by the p numbers ui {xj}   j = 1 ... p. while the existence of a complete envy-free allocation is easily shown to be np-complete  see  lipton et al.  1    things become much harder with eef
existence: all we know is that this problem is np-hard and in   but its precise complexity remains an open problem.
1 concluding remarks
we have identified the exact complexity of the key problem of deciding whether there exists an efficient and envy-free allocation when preferences are represented compactly  in several contexts; we have also considered variations of the problem. we have also drawed connections to a well-studied problem in nonmonotonic reasoning. the next step will consist in designing and experimenting algorithms for the search of an eef allocation  when it exists  and approximation notions for defining optimal allocations when there is no eef allocation  see  lipton et al.  1  for approximate envy-freeness  although not coupled with efficiency .

1 for the sake of illustration  we pick here one of the most simple ones  similar to those used for combinatorial auctions: agents' preferences are numerical  i.e.  utility functions  and are represented by a set of propositional formulas  each of which is associated with a weight denoting its importance; the utility of a set of goods is the sum of the weights of the formulas satisfied. p
