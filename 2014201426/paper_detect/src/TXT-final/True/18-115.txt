the concept of legal  personality  in 
united states constitutional law has changed considerably over the years. an ever-increasing number of groups of ascertainable entities have been recognized as persons under the law  and the rights and obligations accruing to the members of those groups have changed more than they have remained constant. the general question is thus presented of whether computers might be recognized as persons; it is submitted that the correct answer is a qualified  yes.  
　　　the legal histories of several groups  such as olacks and women  have followed the pattern of their i n i t i a l  recognition  as legal persons  followed by a slow accretion of rights and obligations. viewed another way  the i n i t i a l recognition of the members of these groups started a lengthy period during which the legal gap between them and previouslyrecognized persons narrowed. 
　　　decision-makers have used various rationales over the years in extending legal recognition to new groups. the individual decisions tend to reflect the values of their times and do not shed much light on the essence of legal personality. each such extension  however  constituted an acknowledgment that the individual entities being considered were more like the persons doing the considering than like the property belonging to those

　　　it may f a i r l y be said that  as time has passed  the test of personality has focused more on behavior than on appearance  and more on mental t r a i t s than on physical ones. western thinking has come to disfavor tests of personality based on  status   ownership of property  religious a f f i l i a t i o n   or  structure   gender  race ; those tests were invoked  and defeated  almost every time a new group was added to the roster of persons. accordingly  recognition has generally been extended to groups whose members have demonstrated the capacity to behave in a manner indicating that they th ink more like legal persons than l i k e anything else. 
　　　the i n i t i a l question is therefore whether there could exist circumstances such that a decision-maker could examine the behavior of a computer system and decide that the machine had crossed the threshold of legal personality. it seems nearly inevitable that the issue w i l l arise in our increasingly computerized society; science f i c t i o n l i t e r a t u r e abounds with proposed factual scenarios in which that legal issue could be presented. the real question is whether current or foreseeable law provides a plausible foundation for a determination of computer personality. 
　　　it is possible that a decision concerning computer personality could come from the executive or l e g i s l a t i v e branches of government. popular opinion can find expression through those channels when the judiciary is unwilling or incapable of treating ascertainable entities as persons even though society as a whole perceives them as such. an example of such a legislative determination is the twenty-sixth amendment  forbidding discrimination against 1 year olds . 
　　　perhaps the most obvious h i s t o r i c a l example of recognition by executive mandate was the freeing of black slaves who had previously been considered 1 	m.willick 
lawfully recoverable items of property. congress at one time declared iisielf incapable of emancipation  and the courts mainly addressed the impact of local recaption statutes and the fugitive slave laws upon local kidnapping laws. an essentially executive action  a l a r i t y in the f i e l d of extensions of legal persona l i t y     s w i f t l y followed by a series of constitutional amendments  presumed to change the slaves' legal status in one step from that of ascertainable individual items of property to that of f u l l y franchisee! persons. 
　　　in common law systems  however  most   law  comes from the decisions of courts. disputes arising from novel circumstances are reconciled by courts that attempt to draw comparisons between the facts of the cases before  them and the facts of cases previously decided. touched on below are a few of the possible analogies provided by history that could be seized upon by courts seeking to resolve the question of computer personality. which analogy is u t i l i z e d in a given case could well determine the result of the legal dispute. 
　　　it is submitted that the f i r s t computers to attain  personhood  w i l l do so individually  if at a l l   because they w i l l be forced to prove that they are more than the  mere machines  they w i l l be presumed to be. courts are l i k e l y to hesitate before extending to computers the legal precept that   a l l men are created equal   because even today they can be purposefully designed to have any of a broad range of operating characteristics and capabilities. 
　　　given the enormous variety of the machines: called  computers   even proponents of computer personality w i l l probably concede that some w i l l possess the necessary characteristics for that status while others w i l l not. many problems  such as the evaluation of computers of the same model  the impact of a capacity for significant machine learning  e t c .   remain to be addressed. such questions  however  w i l l most probably be decided through use of the terminology and tests developed in other legal disputes. 
	courts 	seeking 	a 	d e f i n i t i o n 	of 
 person  might look to the abortion decisions  which draw distinctions based on the degree of individual development  trimesters ; by analogy  any individual computer exceeding a minimum behavioral capacity roughly equating fetus   v i a b i l i t y   would be presumed to be a person. as with the abortion decisions  a single such decision concerning computer personality could affect many more persons than the parties before the court. 
　　　when a human person dies  he loses a l l of his rights. the law in this area tends to set an over-inclusive minimum  so that any human but one who can oe shown to have died tends to be defined as   a l i v e .   given the recent emergence of  brain death  as a c r i t i c a l factor  and since many computers today can exhibit far more   i n t e l l i g e n t   behavior than that of comatose human beings  who do enjoy legal recognition   a legal minimum standard test of personality could probably be satisfied by a computer system in the proper circumstances. 
　　　the emergence of the modern corporation provides the most subtle means by which computer systems might achieve legal recognition. corporations have names  can buy and sell property  and can commit crimes  but they cannot be drafted  be married  or vote. they are persons  but they are owned  constituting a recognized class of non-human persons that has legal rights and obligations peculiarly tailored to the unusual attributes of i t s members. 
　　　an analogy between such   a r t i f i c i a l   persons and computer systems w i l l appear less strained than comparisons with human beings. additionally  to the degree that the operations of a corporation can be computerized  the corporation and the computer would effectively be the same e n t i t y : no legal change would be required for such de facto recognition of computer personality. 
　　　corporations provide an example of the concept of p a r t i a l personality  whereby an ascertainable entity may be recognized as a legal person for one purpose but not another. the concept has many applications and is not limited to non-humans; certain laws treat fetuses as  persons  for the purpose of inheritance  while others provide that the abortion of such fetuses is not generally to be considered murder. 
　　　the concept is applied in many ways in modern society. minors  for example  slowly accrete rights and obligations as they grow older because of their presumed capacities  while rights are removed 1 r orthe retarded and the insane when their behavior proves to be too far below or outside the societal minimum. the legal system is thus equipped with a variety of approaches with which to decide the extent and variety of rights that should be given to computers that are recognized as persons. 
　　　computer systems that perform increasingly complicated tasks in an increasingly competent manner w i l l be thrust onto these shifting sands of constitutional presumptions  tests  and standards. 
since there does not seem to be an analytically sound test of  personality  that w i l l exclude computer systems which behave i n t e l l i g e n t l y   the question of legal recognition w i l l remain one of  when  and not   i f   u n t i l and unless some absolute limitations on the a b i l i t i e s of such machines can be demonstrated. once computer systems can satisfy established legal tests of personality  either a valid ground of distinction between them and humans w i l l have to be found  or the distinction w i l l have to be abandoned as mere prejudice. 
　　　current a r t i f i c i a l intelligence research increases the need for a prompt examination of these problems. courts have already begun to impose on certain professionals the requirement of use of certain computer systems.* as applied a r t i f i c i a l intelligence techniques cause computer systems to behave in ways t r a d i tionally associated with human i n t e l l i gence  the likelihood of legal scrutiny of the status of those systems increases. 
　　　no uniformly recognized definition exists for intelligence  so it is not surprising that there are at least four different  and largely contradictory  definitions of   a r t i f i c i a l   intelligence. while there appear to be many instances in which measurable intelligence is unnecessary to recognition of legal personality  corporations  comatose humans  e t c .     such recognition appears to be mandated under modern tests wherever such i n t e l l i gence it* present 
　　　a traditional legal test asks whether  reasonable men could d i f f e r   as to a proposed question. if they could  the test allows the question to be submitted to a judge or jury as a question of fact rather than one of law. given the many legal tests of personality  it is submitted that there is  or soon w i l l be  a 
　　　question of fact as to whether a computer which appears to be exhibiting i n t e l l i g e n t behavior is a  person  under the law. given the appropriate facts and a sympathetic jury  that question w i l l at some point be answered in the affirmative.

to recognize computers per se. humans do not endanger their legal recognition by using devices to enhance or replace parts of themselves; the jegal test is subtractive  and it presumes continued recognition. metaphysical considerations aside  only technological  as opposed to s c i e n t i f i c   barriers appear to exist to the eventual direct integration of human brains and computers. no recognitionendangering event would occur by such integration; a  computer-enhanced  person 
would retain recognition. 
　　　presuming that the computer could be made able to perform various tasks as the human lost the a b i l i t y to do so  no behavioral differences would appear as the human parts f a i l e d . because the t r a d i tional legal test looks to behavior  might the mechanical remnant of such a person retain legal recognition  
　　　those arguing otherwise would face the d i f f i c u l t task of convincing a court that the combination had lost i t s right to recognition at some time of biological f a i l u r e   despite i t s continuation of i t s normal a c t i v i t i e s . the law abhors the removal of rights absent behavior outside of or below certain minimum requirements  going so far as to rule that permanently comatose humans remain person.'.. given the foreseeable behavioral capacity of computer systems  it is submitted that mechanical remnants of human/computer combinations w i l l retain legal recognition  at least where the takeover of once-human functions is gradual. 
　　　such developments would present the d i f f i c u l t legal question of how to d i s t i n guish between two computer systems  one or which slowly took over the functions of a human brain  and the other of which simply rolled off of an assembly l i n o . presuming equal behavioral capacities  or even close ones; the law recognizes both geniuses and i d i o t s     no valid ground appears to exist for the denial of legal recognition to the system that was never connected to a human bra in . 
conclusion 
　　　computers today are increasingly behaving in ways t r a d i t i o n a l l y identified as exhibiting consciousness  understanding  and learning  it may prove impossi-
ble in the future to draw a valid legal distinction between humans and computers  either because of the increased behavioral capacity of the latter group  or because the two groups w i l l be l i t e r a l l y   physi c a l l y   inseparable. at that time  constitutional law w i l l recognize at least some computer systems as  persons.
