　　the model is described in which the choice of notions out of the principal  long-termed  memory is determined by t h e i r connections with the notions of the contoxtual  short-termed  memory and by the importances of the notions at a certain moment. a molecular computer is suggested as a possible mechanism of the realization of such memory. 
　　in simulating the problems of r e callection and paying attention we shall consider human consciousness as an analogue of the arithmetical device of a t r i v i a l computer. assume here that the notions which get in the f i e l d of attention  namely  the elements of the description of various pictures of the external world  the relations between these elements  general judgements about them  problems and etc. are processed by the consciousness mechanism in a way similar to that of the contents of the computer memory at the input registers of i t s arithmetical devices. thus  for consciousness to operate in the necessary sequence a mechanism should exist which w i l l supply consciousness with necessary information  that is to place into the f i e l d of attention some notions or other. this mechanism we c a l l  the mechanism of paying a t t e n t i o n   . 
　　notions may enter the f i e l d of attention both from the organs of sense of a person and from his memory  the recallection process . in t h i s case the human memory and the attention paying mechanism are arranged in such a way that they permit a person to find very rapidly a great deal of information which is necessary at the moment. in particular  a person  as a r u l e   promptly recalls the situation possessing certain definite properties  finds laws which can be used in solving a given 
problem  recalls a way f o r the problem solution if the problem has been once solved. on this ground the idea is sometimes suggested that a human memory forms as certain hierarchical structure 
  a tree-shaped one or of some other kind  which permits a person to perform sequential checks in the branching knot and due to it excludes consideration 
of hopeless ways and at this expense allocs to f i n e d necessary information in a r e l a t i v e l y rapid way. s t i l l   the hypothesis based on the idea of the associative memory seems more probable to us. 
　　since the regularities obtained are described by a person  as a r u l e   in the form of statements it is but natural to assume that the statements are one of the main types of the memory elements. 
　　in this case a l l the concepts contained in the statement can be regarded as naturally connected with this statement by means of including a record in a record and it can be suggested that the switching of attention occurs as follows. if the attention was called by a certain statement  and the l a t t e r was in some way transformed into other notions by means of the operators of the consciousness mechanisms  for example  divided into the notions of which it consists   then according to these notions  on the basis of these notions  a certain  connected with them  statement is chosen out of the memory

which contains those notions and the attention is switched over to this statement. however  there can be very many statements connected with the given notions. so the question arises as to which of them the attention should be paid to. 
　　first of a l l   note that in dependence of the situation different notions  statements  in particular  are of different importance for a person; this importance can be interpreted as a prior  subjective  probability of the fact that he w i l l manage to use this notion in solving some problems or other. the existence of the importance value of notions  as well as transformation of notions is a result of the action of the operators of the consciousness mechanisms. here it is natural to suggest that this or that  importance  value is ascribed to each memory element and used on the stage of choosing them out of the memory into attention f i e l d . thus  the solution of the problem as to which of the statements should be payed attention to w i l l be determined not only by connections of the statements with the notions considered but by the importances of the statements as well. 
   also note  that there exists  the attitude to the context  due to which the selection of notions the attention switches over to depends not only upon what the consciousness deals with at a present moment but also upon which has been recently spoken about. 
   evidently  in general case  the very notion of  context  can be related not only to the information  emerging in the process of conversation  but to any other notion  which has been recently paid attention to. thus  e.g.  if we are asked:  have you recently seen pete   - the image of pete emerging in our consciousness proves in evitably connected with the image of the person who is asking  as well as with the place where the question is aksed and with what we have thought about before the conversation. we may know many petes  and s t i l l   as a rule  the f i r s t pete we think about is the one who is known not only to us but to our interlocutor as 
well. it is noteworthy that the process of search for the image of that very pete operates  as a rule  out of our consciousness - no other petes occur to us. this makes the probability of hypothesis of borting the images of various petes very small. we think it more plausible that our of the memory the statement is directly chosen which ascertains the very fact of pete and the questioner being aquainted  i.e. which is connected both with the notion  image  of pete and that of  the questioner  simultaneously. on obtaining this statement and dividing it into separate notions in our consciousness  
we seem to be able to find among them the image of the very pete thich is known both to us and to our interlocutor. if there exist several petes known both to us and our interlocutor  then we generate the image of the one who is in greater correspondence with the situation of the question; e.g. the image of the pete whom we together with our interlocutor met at the place where the question is asked etc. so we can assume that out of the memory the statement is 
chosen connected with the image of pete  and with the questioner and with the place where this question is asked. thus   the questioner  and  place of questioning  serve us as notions forming the context. it is noteworthy  that we 
can already pay no attention to these notion at the moment of questioning. at the same time it was quite recently that they have been in our consciousness and 
they are somewhere  at hand  now  have 
1 great importance   so that our attention can be easily paid to them. stress that 
these notions d i f f e r considerably in their functions from the statements which we recall f o r they are used to establish connections with these statements and to e l i c i t them from the memory into the attention f i e l d . therefore  it is natural to consider that such notions l i e in a separate memory which we shall further c a l l contextual memory  or just context  as apposed to the principal memory where the statements recalled are located. 
　　apparently  not a l l the notions in contextual memory are equal in r i g h t s . there are more important notions and less important ones. e.g.   the person questioning  is usually a more important notion  than  the place of questioning   the former is easier to pay attention t o     though generally speaking it may be just the other way around. this importance seems to t e l l upon the  weight  of the connections of these notions with the statements from the principal memory  the greater the importance of the notion  the greater the  weight  of i t s connection . 'thus  we may consider that the probability of selecting a statement 
out of the principal memory is determined by the importance of this s t a t e ment and by the t o t a l weight of i t s connections with the notions from contextual memory. 
　　seemingly the content of the term  connection  should be widened to some extent assuming that it is not only statements and the notions they use that can be connected  but also any other pairs of notions such that the record of one contains w i t h i t s e l f the record of the other  words and their parts; pictures and t h e i r elements e t c .   . then our f i n i t e concept of the memory arrangement can be summed up as follows. 
　　1. there exist two types of memory: the principal and the contextual one. it is only from the contextual memory that the notions enter the principal 
1 
  l o n g - t e r m e d   memory. the c o n t e x t u a l   s h o r - t e r m e d   memory g a i n s the whole i n f o r m a t i o n from the organs o f sense  and a l s o a l l the r e s u l t s o f the o p e r a t i o n o f the c o n s c i o u s n e s s mechanism   i n p a r t i c u l a r   the s t a t e m e n t s a s t o i n 
w h i c h way and in w h i c h o r d e r the n o t i o n s a t t e n t i o n has been p a i d to were p r o cessed in a c o r r e s p o n d i n g s i t u a t i o n   . i n the a t t e n t i o n f i e l d   t h e i n p u t r e g i s t e r o f the consciousness meclanieu  the n o t i o n s may e n t e r b o t h f r o m t h e 
c o n t e x t u a l memory and f r o m the p r i n c i p a l one. 
　　1. a l l the notions in the principal and contextual memories are always ascribed with certain importance value  that is probabilites of paying attention to these notions  their connection with the context not being taken into consideration . to information from the organs of sense the importance is 
ascribed by means of specific  input  operators. to the other notions of the contextual memory the importances are ascribed by means of the consciousness mechanisms operators. the notions entering the contextual memory immediatly enter the principal memory as w e l l   but with a very small importance. in the course of time the importances of the notions in the contextual memory decrease; and v/ith this their importances in the principal memory grow and f i n a l l y achieve the values proportional  with a coefficient smaller than 1  to the i n i t i a l importances in the contextual memory. 
　　1. the probability of paying attention to the notions from the contextual memory is determined only by the impor-
tance of this notion in this memory. the probability of paying attention to the notions from the principal memory are determined by 1  the importance of this notion in this memory which aefines the probability of choice without taking 
into consideration their connections with the context; and 1  general importance of the notions of the contextual memory connected with it which enlarges the probability of choice. 
   therefore  the probability of selecting notions out of the principal memory  connected with the notions of the contextual memory proves  as a rule  considerably larger than that of selecting any principal memory notion which has no such connections. consequently  it is to the  necessary  notion that our attention switches over with large probability. in the frames of such a model we can also interpret many cases of the  frustration  of attention when the latter is paid to the notion which is not connected  or  weakly connected  with the notions of the context. 
regions of molecular surfaces to the surfaces of other moleculas. as a result  the moleculas corresponding to the attention f i e l d or to the notions 
from the contextual memory are sticked to by those moleculas corresponding to the notions of the principal memory  the regions of the surfaces of which  e.g.  some notions entering the statement  are complementary to the surfaces of the moleculas constituating the attention f i e l d or the context. therefore  the connection between the notions if established by means of compelmentary properties of the surfaces of the moleculas corresponding to these notions. 
　　note  that in frames of such model the importance of the notions is naturally set in the form of the concentration of the moleculas correspond-


   programmers might be dissatisfied by our hypothesis as to the arrangement of human memory. indeed while realizing this arrangement at an ordinary computer the selection of the necessary memory element w i l l demand scanning of the whole memory; that means that the search according to the hiorachical structure could be substantially more effective. s t i l l   it nowise follows that the arrangement of human memory is realized in the same way as at an ordinary computor. in particular  from our point of view a molecular computer /1  1/ could be the most accommodated for realization of this arrangement. the memory elements of such a computer are words-moleculas  
e.g. of dna  rna or proteins. in our case thes moleculas can serve as records of notions  in particular  of statements. the search for the memory elements is being done at the expense of the termal movement of moleculas  and the selection of a  necessary  element occurs at the expense of complementarity of some 
ing to this notions. the greater concentration of the moleculas of the given type  the more probability of colliding with a molecula of this type. this is equally true of the moleculas of both the principal memoxy and the contextual one; the only difference being the fact that the contextual memory moleculars should be considered  cied up  to a certain place wherefrom they can easily transmit the  captured  iuoleculas from the principal memory into attention f i e l d . thereof the notions enter the consciousness mechanism which most probably is realized at the neuronic but not at the molecular level.
