　　boris  ie an experimental computer program designed to understand and answer questions about complicated narratives. by  complicated' we mean narratives which require the specification and interaction of multiple sources of knowledge  including: s c r i p t s   plans  goals  interpersonal relationships  object primitives  affects  settings  social act1  physical states  roles  etc. 
　　in addition  boris p a r t i a l l y implements a theory of mops  memory organization packets   which is used to represent and process such abstrac*. ions as: 
legal disputes  contracts  and personal favors. 
　　while an earlier version of boris read a kidnapping story l 1 j   the specific knowledge currently maintained in boris allows it to process two narratives  each involving a divorce. although these narratives vary s i g n i f i c a n t l y   i . e . l e x i c a l l y   syntactically  and in terms of their outcomes and causal connections   the knowledge structures used by boris are general enough to handle both versions. 
　　the demo w i l l show an execution trace of boris comprehending a portion of divorce-1  a six paragraph story which begins: 
   george was having lunch with another teacher and grading homework assignments when the waitress accidentally knocked a glass of coke on him. george was very annoyed and l e f t refusing to pay the check. he decided to drive home to get out of b i t vet clothes. 
　　　when he got there  he found his wife ann and another man in bed. george became extremely upset and f e l t like going out and getting p l a s t e r e d . . . and answering such questions as: 
	q: 	why didn't george pay the check  
a: becauae the waitress spilled coke on him. 
q: how did ann feel when george caught her cheating on him  a: she was surprised. 
this work supported in part by advanced research 
projects agency contract n1-c-l1 and national science foundation contract ist1. 
　　instead of skimming l l   many stories  boris t r i e s to understand a few complicated stories in as great a depth as possible. to accomplish in-depth 
understanding  boris employs the following: 
- a memory overlay technique which allows boris to model multiple levels and multiple perspectives of knowledge. 
- a theory of taus  thematic affect units  1}   designed for handling expectation failures and norm violations as they occur within narratives. 
　　another general issue examined in boris is processing integration. by ' i n t e g r a t i o n ' we mean that episodic memory is searched  and often created  while each word in a sentence is being parsed. one consequence of this approach  during question answering  is that boris often knows the answer to a question before the question has been completely understood.
