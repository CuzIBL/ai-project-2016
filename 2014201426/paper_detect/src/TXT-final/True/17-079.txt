 
　　　process-monitoring and fault location techniques have been developed at the kennedy space 
center in a domain of mixed media control in nasa's 
space shuttle launch processing system. an intuitively appealing diagnostic technique and representation of the system's structure and function were formulated in cooperation with system 
engineers. functional relationships that determine the consistency of sensor measurements are represented by symbolic expressions embedded in frames. functional relationships are stored in 
exactly one place  so they must be inverted to determine hypothetical values for possibly faulty objects. propagating these hypothetical states to other sensors permits the location of faults. standard symbolic inversion techniques have been extended to include conditional functions. a demonstration system is operating  and its evaluation w i l l soon use live data from the f i r i n g rooms at ksc. 
　　　the space shuttle's external tank is loaded with 1 gallons of liquid oxygen  lox  from a million gallon storage tank  figure 1  about 1 miles from controlling computers at the launch control center. this c r i t i c a l operation begins six to eight hours before launch and must continue to within seconds of ignition. nasa's automated launch processing system controls this process and monitors sensor readings such as temperature  pressures  and valve positions  checking that they are each within some specified range. if anything goes wrong  a few experts must analyze the problem and determine whether to stop the process  leafing through 1 pages of schematics. a delay in troubleshooting could abort the shuttle flight. 
     this is the f i r s t application of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence sponsored by the kennedy space center 
 ksc . an experimental system called les  the lox expert system  has been constructed to aid in monitoring the lox loading process  and diagnosing faults. this domain  its history  and further 

	i 	introduction 
　　　there is growing interest in the use of structure and function to assimilate observations of complex systems and deduce the causes of unexpected behavior. the lox expert system  les  is an experimental system built to process sensor 
data to detect and locate faults in a system without feedback  and built from objects without state. its diagnostic techniques and knowledge representation are designed to be transparent to system users  engineers . by symbolically inverting functional relationships  les need store each relationship only once. we consider this necessary for maintaining large and complex knowledge bases. 
　　　most previous work has been done in domains of electronic circuitry and digital logic  e.g.  davis  1; de kleer  1; genesereth  1   where there are relatively few sensors per active component but the unit under test may be readily taken out of service for diagnostic intervention. the method described here has been applied to a domain of discrete and analog devices with a mixture of electronic  pneumatic  hydraulic  and mechanical control. the domain is rich in sensors and it is les' goal to determine whether a 
　　　perceived fault makes it necessary to stop operations  by looking at presently available information. 
details of its representation are described more fully elsewhere  jamieson  1; delaune  1 . for more complete description of diagnosis methods  knowledge representation  and functional inversion techniques  see  scarl  1 . 
	ii 	definitions and assumptions 
　　　first of a l l   it is assumed that:  a  time between failures is long compared to diagnosis time  ruling out simultaneous failures  which

transient behaviors can be ignored by w a i t i n g for deliberate changes of state to s t a b i l i z e .  c  i n t e r m i t t e n t f a u l t s have cycle times longer than the diagnostic time. 
　　　a complex physical system is represented as a network of functional r e l a t i o n s h i p s . any measurement that gives information about the state of the system is either consistent or discrepant. consistent measurements agree w i t h t h e i r adjacent network components  while discrepant measurements do not. the inputs to t h i s network are commands  and the outputs are sensors. one may t r e a t commands as constraints which propagate through the network to determine an expectation value that describes what an o b j e c t ' s state be. s i m i l a r l y   one may t r e a t a sensor as a constraint which determines a hypothetical value that describes what the o b j e c t ' s state is implied to be by that observation. in les  hypothetical values are derived from both sensors and commands. 
given a sensor discrepancy  each object i s : 
 1  incapable of being the cause and so innocent   1  demonstrably the cause and thus the c u l p r i t   
 1  otherwise a suspect. 
　　　the od  original discrepancy  is the f i r s t discrepancy noticed after a period of untroubled operation. a given sensor's s i b l i n g s are those other sensors that depend in any way upon any of the commands that control i t . 
	i l l 	les 
　　　les' knowledge base includes most of the lox portion of the launch processing system at ksc. this domain includes analog and discrete commands and sensors  and other objects  transducers  relays  solenoids  valves  lox pressures and temperatures  e t c .   whose state the system is designed to control or sense. these are represented using the frame representation language  frl   roberts  1 . a frame describes each replaceable component with i t s type  i t s value  for commands and sensors   and the units and tolerance of i t s output where appropriate. 
　　　three slots  source  source-path and status  express how the component is c o n t r o l l e d : source points to the source of energy   e . g .   a power bus or pressure l i n e   . the boolean source-path expression determines whether the path from source to component is turned on or o f f . this is s u f f i c i e n t for discrete components  but an analog object also needs a status to quantify i t s state when the source-path is on. 
　　　figure 1 shows a s i m p l i f i e d schematic for c o n t r o l l i n g an analog valve. the potentiometer   p o t   ' s status expression simply points to the valve  since i t should d i r e c t l y r e f l e c t the valve's p o s i t i o n . the valve's source-path expression is true if the override closed switch is off and the analog command is on. the valve's status expression gives percentage open. the closed l i m i t switch is d i s c r e t e   and i t s source-path expression is  lessp valve 1     meaning that t h i s switch is 
figure 1. part of lps circuitry for an analog valve 
expected to be on whenever the valve is less than 1 percent open. 
　　　fault detection is invoked whenever a command or sensor value is received  whether from user input  a t e s t f i l e   or a port. if the received value is from a sensor  then the sensor s expectation value is computed by evaluating i t s source-path and status expressions. i t s c o n t r o l l i n g objects are evaluated recursively u n t i l objects are found bearing known values  which in les are always commands. this expectation value is compared with the value received  and the sensor is marked consistent or discrepant accordingly. 
　　　if the received value resets a command  then a l l sensors affected by the command are tested against t h e i r expectations. 
　　　the suspects and relevant commands are the objects and commands v i s i t e d while deriving the expectation value. this dynamic search produces the benefit  also enjoyed by  genesereth  1 's proof techniques  that when an o b j e c t ' s c o n t r o l l e r s are  switched o u t     they and t h e i r related commands and sensors never appear and are i m p l i c i t l y cleared. 
　　　les obtains considerable computational savings by s t o r i n g expectation values in the frames  and r e s e t t i n g them only when commands are changed. this also gives les a l i m i t e d f a c i l i t y for handling components whose state depends upon h i s t o r y as w e l l as current commands. 
　　　the current user interface is a   l i v e   version of parts of nasa's electromechanical schematics. most of these can be generated automatically from the database  new  1   and a l l can be generated as block diagrams. the user moves about by naming or mousing components. sensors and commands display t h e i r current values with any discrepancies h i g h l i g h t e d . values can be moused for i n s t r u c t i o n a l or t e s t i n g purposes  and several object types are animated to indicate t h e i r expectation values.

	iv 	the diagnostic method 
	the 	diagnoser 	is 	invoked when a discrepancy 
 the 1d  has been n o t i c e d . suspects  commands  and s i b l i n g s of the od are located. an attempt is now made to derive a h y p o t h e t i c a l value for each suspect from the od. a suspect is innocent if any one of the f o l l o w i n g four c r i t e r i a is t r u e : 
　　1. the suspect c o n t r o l s the od only through objects known to be innocent. 
　　1. no h y p o t h e t i c a l value can be established for the suspect because the f u n c t i o n a l dependency of od upon suspect cannot be i n v e r t e d . 
　　1. the suspect's h y p o t h e t i c a l value agrees w i t h i t s expectation value. 
　　1. the assumption that the suspect a c t u a l l y has i t s h y p o t h e t i c a l value does not cause a l l sensors 
to become c o n s i s t e n t . 
these c r i t e r i a are l i s t e d in order of a p p l i c a t i o n   but 1 is the core of the a l g o r i t h m . 
       computing a h y p o t h e t i c a l value means understanding what the od's measurement is t e l l i n g us about the s t a t e of one of the suspects. such information is i m p l i c i t in the source-path/status 
dependence of sensor upon suspect  b u t   b e l i e v i n g it important to represent such r e l a t i o n s h i p s uniquely  we do not store these reverse dependencies e x p l i c i t l y . instead  we have automated the inversion of sensor-upon-suspect dependencies. 
       a r i t h m e t i c functions present no special problems  but les' status/source-path expressions may include c o n d i t i o n a l operators l i k e max  or  and  if or even cond  which are not i n v e r t i b l e in the standard sense. nevertheless  it is possible to i n v e r t them using c o n d i t i o n a l t e s t s . for example  if the status of x is  and  status z  
 status y       then les in e f f e c t solves for y as y -  cond   status z   status x      t '*innocent*  . 
the token *innocent* is passed back to the diagnoser t e l l i n g it to declare y innocent  by c r i t e r i o n 1  above . 
	v 	remarks 
　　　the f i r s t a p p l i c a t i o n domain for the method described here is a good f i t w i t h the assumptions l i s t e d i n section i i . 
　　　les' representation scheme for s t r u c t u r a l and f u n c t i o n a l r e l a t i o n s h i p s seems to have advantages in compactness  p e r s p i c u i t y   and in suppressing unneeded d e t a i l . this could be important to an engineer attempting to analyze the network's f u n c t i o n a l i t y under s t r e s s f u l c o n d i t i o n s . les* 
methods are now being considered for experimental development in other prelaunch a c t i v i t i e s at ksc  some of which have proven more expensively troublesome than lox loading  if not so c r i t i c a l in the f i n a l countdown.
