	i i . 	some solution methods 
       this puzzle may be solved through the use o♀ a state-space representation1 of the problem and by applying some search techniques to discover a s o l u t i o n . the f o l l o w i n g sub-sections describe some of these methods. 
1. 	blind search: 
　　　consider stacking the cubes one by one. there are twenty-four d i f f e r e n t ways that a cube can be posit i o n e d . thus the state-space representation of the problem may be envisioned as p i c t u r e d in figure 1. 

	i . 	i n t r o d u c t i o n 
　　　two major steps in problem solving are the problem representation and the problem s o l u t i o n . these two steps are very much i n t e r r e l a t e d . problem r e p r e -
sentations have a great influence upon the e f f i c i e n c y of s o l u t i o n methods. a number theory1 approach is proposed in t h i s paper f o r both the representation and the s o l u t i o n of problems. when a p p l i c a b l e   t h i s approach turns out to be very concise in the representation and very e f f i c i e n t in the s o l u t i o n of problems. even though not a l l problems can be solved 
w i t h t h i s approach  it s t i l l opens up a d i r e c t i o n that researchers may want to look i n t o to devise b e t t e r 
methods in solving problems. 
　　　the tower of cubes puzzle is used to i l l u s t r a t e t h i s approach in problem s o l v i n g . to play t h i s puzz l e   a player is given four cubes w i t h sides in four d i f f e r e n t c o l o r s . each cube may be d i f f e r e n t from the other in the sense that one cube may have three red sides  one blue s i d e   one white side  and one green s i d e   while another cube may have two blue sides  two green sides  one red side  and one white side. the four cubes are shuffled and turned randomly before given to the player. the objective of the player is to stack the cubes into a tower so that there are four c o l o r s   a l l d i f f e r e n t   showing on each side of the 
　　　tower. 
　　　we can describe the state of a cube by a s i x tuple of the form   f r o n t   back  l e f t   r i g h t   t o p   bottam . for example  the tuple  r w b b g r  desc r i b i s a cube w i t h the f r o n t side in r e d   the back side in w h i t e   the l e f t side in b l u e   and so f o r t h . 
　　　with any given input c o n f i g u r a t i o n of the puzzle  the computer can be used to solve the puzzle. d i f f e r -
ent methods can be used and are b r i e f l y discussed in section i i . in section i i i   a method using the number theory approach is proposed which w i l l f i n d a s o l u t i o n to the puzzle e f f i c i e n t l y   or if a s o l u t i o n does not e x i s t   i n d i c a t e that a s o l u t i o n does not

　　　for four cubes t h i s method can involve a maximum of 1 1 1 paths. although awkward  it is not p r o h i b i t i v e to use the b l i n d search method on a modern computer. however  if one extends the game by adding a d d i t i o n a l cubes and c o l o r s   t h i s method r a p i d l y becomes u n f e a s i b l e .

1. 	heuristic searches 	problem representation. 

　　　different heuristics may be used to improve the efficiency of the search. some of these heuristics are discussed below. 
ci  assume a solution is found and turn the solution tower 1 degrees clockwise and we obtain another solution. this suggests that at level 1  in figure 1  we do not really need to generate twenty-four nodes- let us assign numbers to the sides of a cube as in figure 
1. 

figure 1 
it becomes apparent that we need to generate only three nodes at level 1  for example  with side 1  side 1 and side 1 on top  respectively. hence the search w i l l then involve a maximum of 1 ＊ 1 - 1 paths. 
 1  before starting the search one may want to select the cube with the most sides in one color and place it on top of the tower. following this  one attempts to  hide  the dominant colors of each cube. that is  each cube is examined to determine which color  if any  
appears most often. 	the cube is then positioned  if possible  so that this color is on the top and bottom of the cube. 	hence the dominant color i s   in a sense   hidden . 	this heuristic can prevent some unnecessary searching whenever a solution exists. 
o  the tree searching down a twig may be halted whenever a node is found to be incompatible with a solution. that i s   no further searching down that twig 
need be performed if two cubes having the same color on one side of the tower are found. 
 1  other heuristics may also be used. however  when a solution does not exist  an extensive search may be required. if the puzzle is extended by the addition of more cubes and colors then a heuristic search may s t i l l be intolerable. the following section describes an algorithm which overcomes some of the problems of the search methods. 
	i i i . 	a number theory approach 
     a number theory approach to problem representation and solution is presented in this section. in short  this approach w i l l make use of specially derived numbers to represent a problem concisely and solve it efficiently. unfortunately there is no algorithm or rule of thumb that can be established to derive the appropriate numbers for a problem. 
     this approach can be described by the following steps. 
 1  find a good notation or language for describing the problem. 
 1  construct a set  or sets  of production rules which can be used to perform valid transformations of the problem representation into problem solutions or into forms from which solutions can be easily derived. 
 1  attempt to revise the production rules  to obtain an optimal set of rules  and describe them abstractly  hopefully in some computer compatible language. 
 1  apply the production rules to a problem representation to obtain an intermediate representation from which solutions can be more easily derived  or 
when possible  to obtain the solutions directly. 
 1  if necessary  select an appropriate search procedure and apply it to find the solutions. 
     these steps are clearly interdependent. the selection of a notation for describing the problem 
w i l l likely enhance or inhibit the optimization of the production rules  and the successful abstraction of a set of production rules can make the search process efficient or even unnecessary. 	the tower of cubes puzzle provides an excellent example of a successful application  of the number theory approach. the following is a description of the application of this approach to the tower of cubes puzzle-
     to begin with  the properties of a problem must be thoroughly investigated. for the tower of cubes puzzle  the convention was adopted to describe each cube as a six-tuple of the form  front  back  l e f t   right  top  bottom . using this description  the following properties are noted. 
1. although each cube is described as a six-tuple  the description of a solution configuration for each cube is only a four-tuple of the form  front  back  l e f t   right . this is obvious since a description of any four sides of a cube w i l l uniquely determine the description of the two remaining sides. however  it should be noted that the i n i t i a l description of a cube must contain a description of a l l six sides  since the  top  bottom  sides may be rotated into the position of the  front  back  or  left  right  sides. 
 1  	derive an appropriate set of numbers useful for 	1. 	we can assign unique numbers to each of the four 
1 1. the production rules. a series of simple production rules may be used. however  it should be noted that these rules rely on the principle that the description of the  top  bottom  sides is of no interest in the final solution. thus         w i l l be used to indicate either  top  bottom  or bottom  top   noting that it is not necessary to make a distinction. given any description of a cube of the form   at a1    b1 b1    c1.c1  . it can be transformed into other descriptions by the following rules. 

colors which w i l l greatly simplify the analysis of the puzzle. these numbers should be chosen in such a way that if one adds any eight of the numbers assigned to the sides then an examination of the resulting sum w i l l indicate if each number cor color  appears in the summation exactly twice. the theorems concerning the selection of these numbers are presented in section iv. the following numbers were selected for the four cube  four color tower of cubes puzzle: 
search in the description matrix for a rearrangement of the description matrix such that the above equations are satisfied. 	if such a search f a i l s   then no solution exists for the given puzzle. 	section iv contains the theorems which verify end describe this process. 	it should be noted that  after a successful search  the necessary rearrangement of the description 
matrix can be performed by applying the appropriate interchange-tuple production schema.

1. the description matrix. a 1 by 1  description matrix  can be computed  describing only essential information needed to discover the solution configuration. given an input configuration of the form: 
if one fails to find these two four-tuples  then there is no solution to the puzzle. 
the corresponding description matrix v is com-puted as: 　　　the search process is to find two independent paths from the top row to the bottom row in the des-and aij bji and cij are the numbers assigned to the sides of the cubes using the scheme of section 1 above. 
　　　the interchange-within-tuple production schema w i l l not affect the description matrix. 	however  the interchange-tuple production schema can be extended to the description matrix as follows: 　　　another property of this search process that should be mentioned is that a node is simply an integer number instead of a six-tuple or a four-tuple as 
in the search methods described in section i i . 	hence the overall saving in this search process is tremen-
dous. 
 1  rearrange the input configuration to conform to the solution description matrix found in step  1 . cription matrix such that the values of these two paths are both 1. a path is defined to be a set containing one and only one element from each row of 
	the description matrix. 	paths are said to be inde-
pendent if they are mutually exclusive sets. 	the value of a path is the sum of the values of the elements in the path. 
     the search process in the description matrix w i l l involve a maximum of 1 = 1 paths. this number is 
considerably smaller than the maximum numbers of paths that may be involved in the other search methods des-
cribed in section i i   
in other words  get two cube-sides in each different color on the front-and-back sides of the tower and on the left-and-right sides of the tower. this can be 
performed by applying the interchange-tuple production schema appropriately. 
　　　specifically  let the input configuration have the form: 
it can easily be shown that the description matrix corresponding to the solution configuration has 
the following property: 
and let the objective configuration of this step have 
the form: 
thus a search for the solution conceptually is just a

matrix  then we can  whenever possible  apply the interchange-tuple production schema such that the front-and-back and the left-and-right sides of the tower w i l l each be composed of 1n cube-sides whose colors w i l l consist of two and only two of each of the   
n colors. 	this is the f i r s t of the two steps in arranging the cubes to conform to the solution of the 
puzzle. 
theorem 1: let b be the 1n-element set  a 1   a1  a 1   a1 .............an' an} where a1 = aj if i = j. let a be a set of n ordered pairs where the pairs are chosen by arbitrarily selecting  without replacement  the 1n elements from the set b. then one can rearrange the elements in the ordered pairs in a by possibly switching the order of the elements of some pairs in a such that one gets a new set  c  of ordered pairs where a l l the elements a1  a1 ......................an appear exactly once on 
both the left and the right positions of the pairs. 
proof: 	this theorem can be proved via the following constructive procedure. 	the new set  c  is originally null. 
step 1; 	select the f i r s t available ordered pair from a and call the pair a. 	call the right element in a by the name b. 	stop if a is empty. 
step 1: there must be one and only one other b in the available ordered pairs in a including the pair a. search for b in the available ordered pairs and this search process must succeed. if the other b is in the 
	pair a  then go to step 1. 	otherwise  go to step 1. 
step 1: 	the other b is in the pair a and it must be in the left position of a. 	remove a from a and add it to c. 	at this step  every element that appears on the left position of a pair in c must also appear on the right position of a pair in c. 	go to step 1. 
step 1: 	the other b may be in either the left or the right position of the new ordered pair. 	switch the order of the elements in the pair if the other b is in the right position in the pair. 	now call the right element of the pair by the name b. 	remove the pair from a and add it to c. 	go to step 1. 
　　　since the set a has a f i n i t e number of ordered pairs in i t   the preceding procedure must terminate after a f i n i t e number of steps. it is also apparent that upon termination  the set c must have the desired 
property. 
　　　theorem 1 guarantees that if both the front-andback and the left-and-right sides of the tower of cubes are each composed of 1n cube-sides on which each of the n colors is represented exactly twice then the 
interchange-within-tuple production schema w i l l allow us to arrange the tower of cubes to conform to the solution of the puzzle. furthermore  the proof o♀ this theorem gives a simple procedure that can be used in the second step to arrange the cubes to conform to the solution. 
	v. 	conclusion: 
     as nileson says   research on solving puzzles and games has generated and refined many problem-solving ideas that are also genuinely useful on less frivolous tasks . puzzles and games provide a rich source of example problems for research in problem-solving. many researchers such as slagle and greenblatt reported on research with games but much less research with puzzles is reported.

　　　the tower of cubes puzzle with four cubes and four colors is by no means a prohibitive puzzle to be solved in any method on the modem computer. however  the solution of a generalized tower of cubes puzzle with n cubes and n colors rapidly becomes more and more time consuming as n gets larger. 
     as discussed in this paper  the selection of a problem-solving method can make a big difference in the efficiency of the problem solution. the methods 
discussed in section ii are rather conventional and are used to illustrate the effect of the differences in solution methods. they are also used to serve as a contrast to the number theory approach proposed in section i i i . it should be noted that the procedure described in section i i i is not the only efficient solution procedure for the puzzle. there are several other very efficient methods. the busacker-saaty approach which makes use of a 1-arc  1-node graph is also an efficient method. it uses a search for two disjoint subgraphs having certain properties. 
　　　the number theory approach illustrates how logical reasoning and number theory techniques may be used in the representation and the solution of a problem. when applicable  the number theory approach may result in a very concise representation of a problem and a very efficient solution method of the problem. at this time it is unknown just how widely applicable this approach is to general problem solving. however  it is hoped that this paper may stimulate other researchers to attempt to apply it to various problems.
