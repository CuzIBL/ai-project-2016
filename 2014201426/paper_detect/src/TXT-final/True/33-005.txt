 
     many rules of formal debate are well documented  of common knowledge  and  looked-up  in preparation for planned debating. informal debates  on the other hand  are highly dynamic  are complex  and are spontaneously generated with no prior rule-book preparation. they too  however  are rule-governed. in t h i s paper i present an abstract process model capable of modeling  well  formed  argument structures that occur in ordinary conversations. the formalization rests on a general theorettical framework for discourse engagement encapsulated in a disoourse atn grammar. a major feature of the system is its segmentation of disoourse utterances into functionally related oontext spaoes. 
a  	introduction 
     a close analysis of spontaneous conversation reveals that it is highly rule-governed  and that i t s underlying structure is a hierarohioal 

simultaneously  1  accounts for many surfaoe linguistics phenomena found in conversational speech:  1  i d e n t i f i e s the relevant discourse oontext in which subsequent utterances are generated/interpreted;  1  explains the semantic coherent flow of a conversation; and  1  specifies options available to oonversants at discrete points in the dlsoourse. these elements are fundamental in modeling informal debate structures. 
b. 	the context spaoe theory of dlsoourse 
1. conversational moves 
     in the discourse theory proposed here  a conversation is seen as a sequence of converzational moves wherein each move corresponds to a speaker's nnmnnlfiitilyft msml vls-a-vis a particular m p r e c e d i n g s e c t i o n of discourse.  support *  challenge ＊ and   i n t e r r u p t     are of the communicative goals i d e n t i f i e d in this 
the goals are specific to  maxim-abiding raj thematio development of a dlsoourse  and do refer to underlying speaker emotive intentions. o not

discourse environment for the move's appropriate performance;  1  different nodes of f u l f i l l m e n t ; and  1  varied effects on a discourse context. effective communication is enabled by oonversants being aware of such a standardisation of conversational moves. 
1. a relevant dlsoourse oontext 
	discourse 	structuring lng 	and 	segmentation 
provides a mechanism by which which to delineate 	that 
' limited portion of preceding discourse directly relevant to the ongoing exchange. for example  when development of a oontext spaoe is interrupted  the interrupted space is not of direct relevanoe to the ensuing conversation u n t i l the digression is oompleted and the interrupted spaoe is resumed from i t s point of interruption. 
     different forms of topic suspension and resumption is a typical feature of extended discourse. by associating different levels of i n f l u e n t i a l status with a context spaoe  a space's various suspension states during the coourse of an exchange oan be captured. 
     the i n f l u e n t i a l status of a space reflects i t s foreground-background disoourse r o l e . only oontext spaces in a foreground role are d i r e c t l y related to current discussion  and only they are considered to be in the current relevant dlaoourse context. in general  the relevant oontext is limited to the context space under ourrent development  called the j
   % and the one other space c a l l e d the spaoe  	vis-a-vis 	which 	the goal of the active space applies. 
     in the oontext spaoe framework  relevant context i d e n t i f i c a t i o n is enabled by recording the standardised effects of taken conversational moves. these effects include reassigning the i n f l u e n t i a l status of preoeding spaces and creating and deleting outstanding disoourse expectations of moves to follow. 
1. context spaoes 
     context spaoes enoode information both e x p l i c i t and i m p l i c i t in the dialogue. the spaces are characterised in muoh the  same way as elements of s  systemic grammar   via attributes represented as   s l o t s   a la mlnsky   1   . some slots are standard for a l l context spaoes. other slots are specific to the communicative goal served by the space - they r e f l e c t the i m p l i o i t i n f e r e n t i a l elaborations needed for a constituent type to serve a given disoourse role. 
     for example  substantive supports usually involve expression of some e t a t e - o f - a f f a i r s   f  such that there exists some generic supportprinciple  p  a la toulmln'a notion of a *baoking    1       of the form  a implies b   such thst f is an instanoe of a  or not b . c is an instance of b  or not a   and using some inference

and is used by r to modify and supersede her i n i t i a l claim of lines 1. after acceptance of d's lines 1 challenge  only a child's environment before kindergarten is relevant. r therefore equates  environment before kindergarten  with  child's home  and addresses herself to this residual issue. 
　　　the antecedent of   i t   on line 1 is  the aggressive nature of the c h i l d     last mentioned on line 1. a relevant discourse context for a replacement claim is the claim being superseded. using such a structural analysis of the discourse enables effective modelling of r's long distance pronomlnallzation. 
　　　line 1: this same c r i t e r i a of discourse pronominalizatlon and structural analysis of a discourse  enables effective modelling of r's subsequent short dlstanoe nonpronominalization of  the two brothers  on line 1 though they were just referenced on line 1 and no other potential antecedents had intervened. by line 1  line 1 is no longer part of the relevant discourse context. 
o concluding a set of supportive utterances  lines 1  with the claim they support  line 1  removes the supportive utterances from the relevant discourse context. 
　　　line 1: line 1 is a restatement of line 1 and line 1 is a further support of i t .  the utterances cannot be a continuation of lines 1 because they are of definite modality  whereas the modality of lines 1 is hypothetical.  
　　　despite d's intervening use of  they  to refer to  two people   his use of  they  on line 1 to refer to  the two brothers  is unambiguous  because the utterances containing  two people  and the preceding  they  are no longer in the current relevant discourse context. they are therefore not possible antecedents for this pronominal form. 
o resumption of the initiating subject of an analogy  line 1  simultaneously reinstantiates the i n i t i a t i n g utterances as the current relevant discourse context  and removes a l l analogous and transitional utterances from it  lines 1 . 
c. 	the atn grammar 
　　　the formalism chosen to encode the context space process model is an augmented transition network  atn  a la woods  - register testing and action executions along atn transitions seem a natural way capture many of the context sensitive aspects of extended discourse. in the discourse atn  these tests and actions correspond to the preconditions and effects of conversational moves  and state transitions  often  correspond to a finer characterization of conversational move mode fulfillment . 
　　　figure 1 in appendix i represents a small portion of the discourse atn.  due to space considerations only  push / jump  actions are noted.  the model is written in terms of a basic loop  a single traversal of which represents the taking of a single conversational move. on each transition cycle  the process model begins in the  produce-next-hove  state  wherein it chooses a conversational move category; in one of the last arcs traversed  there is delineation of an abstract characterization of the message to be generated. the characterization specifies a semantic/logical 
　  see  for f u l l discussion of further correspondences  and distinctions  between this discourse atn and typical atns used in sentential processing. 
relation between the utteranoes generated and utterances contained in the current controlling context space. this characterisation must be met if the subsequent utteranoes are to f u l f i l l the given conversational role oategory. the characterizations are written in a predicatecalculus like language  where functions like  for a l l      infer   ''imply   and  exclusive-or   are considered primitives of the system. 
　　there are three major modes of processing performed in a conversation:  1  finer and finer categorization of the type of message to be enerated;  1  updating our mental models of the lsoourse in preparation for generation of such remarks  and  1  actual production. 
correspondingly  the grammar's states  via the type of actions on their arcs  are of three modes:  1  organizational  wherein tests and decisions are performed in finer categorization of the forthcoming conversational move category;  1  constructive  wherein the updating actions associated with a given move  which include register assignments and the creating and updating of context spaces  are performed; and  1  productive  wherein the actions on arcs entail formation of the message to be generated. 
1. modelling informal debate moves 
　　　in informal debating  our highest level categorization of likely conversational moves are  1  challenging an opponent  executing a challengechoice expectation ;  1  further onallenglng an opponent  executing a further-challenge expectation ; and  1 giving support to one's claims. the following are the i n i t i a l discourse model updating effects individually associated with each move. 
　　　the challenge move: a next speaker is selected who is either:  1  the speaker noted in the accompanying discourse expectation;  1  a conversant known to be on the expected speaker's side;  1  a previously neutral conversant who is appended onto the expected speaker's side; or  1  a conversant switching sides in the debate. in addition  the oqnversant being challenged   i . e .   the last speaker  is assigned the role of futuredefender  to reflect that s/he w i l l most likely counterchallenge the forthcoming challenge. 
　　　the further-challenge move: a furtherchallenge always entails a discourse pop to some preceding claim of an opponent which has led to ourrent subargumentatlon. it therefore involves closing intervening argumentation and reestablishing the context space popped back to  or one of i t s direct subconstituentsj as the relevant discourse oontext for subsequent generation. this is accomplished by traversing the links between context spaces  beginning with the active apace and ending with the one being popped back to   i . e .   the context space noted in the discourse expectation being processed . 
　　　a next speaker is then chosen in manner similar to the oounterchallenge case. here  however  the last speaker  who is a team member of the newly selected speaker  is not assigned the future-defender role  but rather  the protagonist of the space popped back to is. 
　　the support choice move: here too the rammar's f i r s t action is to select a next speaker  n this case  either the current speaker continues to hold the floor  or a speaker known to be on the current speaker's side is seleoted as next speaker. as a new challenge is not being generated  no conversant is put into the future-defender role.

1. tracing through exoerpt 1 
     to i l l u s t r a t e the operation of the discourse atn  l e t us follow some details of the prooess' modeling excerpt 1. 
     r's move on line 1 of the excerpt  as indicated by the clue words   except  however   is a challenge conversational move. at this point in the conversation the oonversants are already in the midst of a debate  and r ia counter challenging d's preceding claim that most criminal behavior la not environmentally induoed* let's begin then with the grammar having already decided to have r as next speaker performing a challenge conversational move. major features of the grammar's ourrent model of the dlacourse  then  are: 
o head-ccs points to c1  the current controlling context space in the discourse environment. 
o major s l o t f i l l e r s of c1 are: state   controlling; type = debative-issue; 
protagonist   r; claim * many criminals are inherently e v i l ; antagonist = d; counterclaims x c1; 
o ccs points to c1  the current active context space in the discourse. 
o major s l o t f i l l e r s of c1 are: tips = debative-issue; protagonlat = d; claim   
genetics is not to blame for most people's criminal actions: goal * challenge; co* relator = c1; method   range-application; state a active. 
o speaker = r; future-defender   d; participant-list =  d  m ; sides = 
	  d . r  ; 	expectation-list 	  	  further-
     the prooess model begins by appending onto i t s l i s t of outstanding discourse expectations the expectation that r is l i k e l y to l a t e r further challenge d'a preceding claim. then  modeling r's move  it chooses an indirect-challenge mode of argumentation. 
     indirect challenges  as contrastive with some forms of direct challenges  always entail c i t a t i o n of a substantive claim whose communicative goal is in direct opposition to that of the ourrent active context apace. as such  t h i s conversational move category always results in a oontext space s h i f t and establishment of a new relevant discourse context. to set the proper environment for subsequent generation  therefore  the grammar now pushes to a constructive state  whose actions include: 
o changing the state value of the oontext space pointed to by head-ccs   i . e .   c1  to generating. a generating atate reflects that continued discussion is i n d i r e c t l y related to the context apaoe  and that therefore there is some chance of a l a t e r return to this space  as reflected by the  further-challenge  d  c1  expectation yet outstanding ; 
o changing the atate value of the oontext apace pointed to by ccs   i . e .   c1  to controlling  and assigning head-ccs to i t . 
this reflects that while subsequent generation w i l l be d i r e c t l y related to the space  it w i l l not be a continuation of i t s contained utterances. 
o creating: a new debative-issue context apace  c1  to contain components of the forthcoming move. ccs is assigned to it  and i t s following slots are f i l l e d : state 
 - active; goal  - challenge; co-relator  - c1; protagonist  - r. 
     returning from this constructive state  the gra ear is now ready to further subcategorize the mode of indirect challenge. since the modality of d's claim is negative  a challenge based on moduatollendo-ponena is appropriate   i . e .   in response to an opponent'a claim of not b   a speaker claims not a   where a exclusive-or b is truet. 
     the grammar begins by generating the clue words associated with this move   except  however   and  then  f a c i l i t a t e s c i t a t i o n of an authority for the claim about to be given. supportive utterances and the claim they support serve different functional roles in a diacourae and as suoh are dlatlnot constituents of i t : supportive spaces are suboonstituents of the space they support. therefore  in preparation for r'a support c i t a t i o n   the grammar f i r s t constructs a new supportive oontext space  c1  assigning i t s goal s l o t to support  and its co-relator s l o t to c1. r's authority c i t a t i o n la then generated  and inserted into the authority s l o t of this spaoe. 
     returning from the support push  the grammar f i l l s c1's supportcs s l o t with the newly created support space. and then it generates r's challenging claim. the claim la inserted into c1's claim s l o t   and  modus-tollendo-ponens  is inserted into i t s method s l o t . then  as oommon for a l l indirect challenges  the new challenge oontext apace is inserted into the counterclaim s l o t of the spaoe being challenged   i . e .   the controlling context space c1 . 
     the grammar then pops back to the general challenge state category  wherein it always creates the expectation that the challenged conversant   i . e .   the one assigned to a future-defender r o l e     w i l l counterchallenge the challenge just cited   i . e .   the active oontext space . 
     having ended simulation of r's challenge move  the grammar re-enters i t s s t s r t state where it begins to prooess the next conversational move. there it chooses to process this last discourse expectation created   i . e .    challenge-choioe1  d  c1  . control therefore once again immediately passes to the general challenge stste of the grammar. this time  m  yet an unaligned converssnt  is ohosen as next speaker and she is appended onto d's side of the debate. r  the preceding: speaker  is assigned the future-defender role. control is then passed to the challenge d i r e c t l y state. 
     since r's support of c1 only entailed c i t a t i o n of an authority  demanding some substantive 
support  uestlon  via is appropriate. generation of as this move does not  how   why  nvolve c i t a t i o n of a contrary claim  the move does not result in the creation of a new context space or accompanying establishment of a new relevant discourse context. instead  i t s effect is to r e s t r i c t the addressed oonversant's subsequent conversational move to one of support. this constraint is noted in the counterchallenge expectation set up for the future-defender   i . e .    challenge-cholcel. r  c1   supply-support-claim   is appended onto the expectation-list r e g i s t e r   . 
     on the grammar's next cycle through the network  it chooses to process this expectation: r is selected as next speaker  and m is assigned the role of future-defender. this time  however  transitions to either the direct or indirect challenge forms are forestalled by the expectation register test on the aros of these transitions. in accordance with maxim-abiding constraints  the grammar  therefore  goes to the support state  wherein it generates the demanded support  a formal analysis of which has cited ear us!.' 
     at this point  l e t ' s skip to the last section of the excerpt in i l l u s t r a t i o n of the grammar's method of modeling context space resumptions. m's utterances on lines 1 do not oontinue d's preceding conversational move  but rather  serve as a further challenge to r's claim on line 1  via attack on i t s support of lines 1* formally apeaklng  m's challenge entails challenging r'a mappings of  two people sharing the same environment  onto  two twins l i v i n g in a same home.

	d  	conclusion 
　　　the key element of this analysis is a structural and functional decomposition of a discourse into distinct  but related and linked  context space constituents. context spaces are characterized by their functional role in a discourse and they oontain information both explicit and implicit in the dialogue. this decomposition is enabled by: 
o formalization of a set of standard conversational moves performed in 
discourse; 
o formalization of the effects of each of these moves on a discourse context. such effects constrain and set up predictions for subsequent thematic development; 
o identification of clue word cues that signal a conversant'a forthcoming conversational move; 
i have illustrated that such a structural decomposition enables the grammar to: 
o effectively 	model 	discourse 
 non pronominalization; 
o identify the limited preceding section of  talk  serving as a point of reference for subsequent discourse generation and/or interpretation; 
o clearly mark and hence ignore a l l intervening discourse that need not even be considered in re-establishment of a relevant discourse context; 
o have explicit annotation of elements of a discourse that are only implicit in a 
speaker's verbalization of a given conversational move. such explication enables the grammar to identify those components of a preceding move that an opponent is challenging  though  at a superficial level  the opponent does not deny anything that has been said. 
　　　the context space theory delineates a single abstract structure underlying a l l discourse forms expository text  argumentative text  narrative text - and based on such structure characterization it is able to specify a single set of  maxim-abiding    well-formedness   rules applicable to  and governing a l l discourse forms. its basic components of segmentation  selective attention  relevant context identification  cues  and expectations  correspond to the fundamental elements of many cognitive processes  1  1 .
