introduction 
in the so-called possible worlds semantics for modal logic  modal operators are interpreted as quan t i f i c a t i o n s over   w o r l d s     constrained by some   a c c e s s i b i l i t y   r e l a t i o n . but in the language of modal l o g i c   worlds are not e x p l i c i t e l y named  i . e . there is no syntactic item  such as variables or constants  denoting them. we consider that much of the success of modal logic comes from t h i s feature  since the variableless operatorsoand o can be c l o sely r e l a t e d w i t h current language operators l i k e  necessary    always   or  i believe t h a t   . but from a theorem proving point of view  is t h i s c h o i ce appropriate   this is not that obvious : j u s t observe the d i f f i c u l t i e s encountered by d i f f e r e n t authors who t r i e d to extend robinson's resolution method to f i r s t order modal theorem proving   c i a l dea 1   abadi manna 1   konolidge 1   . indeed it is c e r t a i n l y not easy to cope w i t h the dependencies between objects of the discourse domain and worlds  which are in fact specified by a f i r s t order modal formula  in a formalism which avoids naming the l a t t e r .

　　a well-known way of r e s t o r i n g   say  a syntactic status to the worlds and the a c c e s s i b i l i t y r e l a t i o n is to translate modal formulas into a f i r s t order classical logic with a binary r e l a t i o n symbol to denote the a c c e s s i b i l i t y r e l a t i o n . this d i r e c t i o n has been proposed by several authors in the a . i . f i e l d   f . i .  moore 1  . but it seems that we loose 
much of the structure of the i n i t i a l l y given modal formulas in the process of t r a n s l a t i o n   and t h i s is to be paid in terms of e f f i c i e n c y . 
　　in this paper we propose another method for modal theorem proving. this method is based on a t r a n s l a t i o n into a f i r s t order classical l o g i c   but the target logic is tailored to better f i t the structure of modal formulas. 
　　we c a l l this logic path logic. it possesses three types a  w and i . objects of type i  are those 
of the discourse domain. objects of type w represent worlds. concerning a  we can see it as the type of operators on objects of type w. the idea is to capture the notion of a c c e s s i b i l i t y r e l a t i o n in the following way :  the world wf is accessible from w  
w i l l be expressed by the sentence  w* is obtained from w by application of an operator in a . through our translation in path logic  the various systems of modal logic are mapped into equational theories expressing some constraints on the system of operat o r s . proposition 1 provides the correspondance for q  t  q1  s1 and s1. 
　　the question of modal theorem proving then amounts to classical theorem proving in some equat i o n a l theories. different methods can be i n v e s t i gated and in this paper  we consider resolution.we 
may use resolution with paramodulation l i k e in 
 walther 1   or a combination of resolution and rewriting techniques l i k e in   p l o t k i n 1  and  fages 1 . both these theories provide  free of charge  a framework immediately applicable to path logic with completeness theorems  proposition 1   . consider i n g e f f i c i e n c y   plotkin-fages method seems better and we present here in details i t s application to path logic. 
　　in p a r t i c u l a r   we must face the following problem. the equational theories considered for some modal system  q1 s1 possess an associative operator  and associative u n i f i c a t i o n in general is known as a d i f f i c u l t question  fages  huet 1   pecuchet 1 . the d i f f i c u l t y is overcome here by defining a spec i a l skolemisation   strong skolemisation in the paper  . a u n i f i c a t i o n algorithm based on these results 
has been defined and proved correct  proposition 1   . 
similar approaches are proposed by l. farinas and

1 automated deduction 

   let us call e-resolution the deductive system consisting of one inference rule which  given two clauses c1 and c1 allows to infer any e-resolvant of c1. and c1. as usual a refutation is a proof of the empty clause. 
theorem 1  plotkin  fages  : 
a clausal formula is e-unsatisfiable i f f there 
exists a refutation of this formula by e-resolution  
   let us apply this result to path logic  we can introduce in the signature s skolem functions of the convenient arities and types and associate  in the standard way  with every formula h of l s  a clausal formula h' equivalent to h with respect to l s -satisfiability. combining this process with the traduction t thanks to proposition 1  we can associate with every modal formula b of s a formula b' of l s  in clausal form such that b' is l s unsatisfiable i f f b is s-unsatisfiable. then we have : 
proposition 1 : 
let b any modal formula  s any system among q  t  
q1  s1  s1  and b' the skolemized of t b . b is s-unsatisfiable i f f we can refute b' by e s -resolution. 


there is no finite complete set of e-unifiers. 
   it is possible to enumerate the members of a complete set of unifiers  f . i . using the  narrowing  procedure  fages 1   fay 1 . but there is a better way on. we can take advantage of the particular structure of the formulas obtained in l s  by trans lation from s  and perform a skolemisation finer than the standard one  which w i l l ensure the desirable finiteness property. this is what we call strong skolemisation. at the present time it is defined for the modal systems q  t  q1  s1  so that they are the only systems under consideration in this section. 
   since the process of strong skolemisation is a bit complex  we rather present here the result t  b  of applying it to the translation t b  of a 
   modal formula b.

1. extensions - discussion 
extensions 
our method can be extended to deal with logics with several different modalities  or multimodal logics  such as epistemic logic with many agents. if no 
relation is specified between the modal operators  
we just need to consider subtypes of type a corres ponding to the different modal operators  and the 
characteristic set of equations for each one. we can also deal with relations between modalities specified by axiom schemas like a -d a  by 
setting some order on the subtypes. again walther's techniques immediately apply  and we are studying the extension of plotkin-fages ones. 
discussion 
1 - the unique prefix property constitutes a characterisation of a subset of the set of formulas of path logic in which modal logic can be embedded. this feature distinguishes our translation from the   t r i v i a l   one envolving a binary relation symbol to denote the accessibility relation. we consider that it indicates that translation from 
modal logic to path logic is a good compromise keeping part ot the structure of modal formulas 
while adding what is necessary of extra mathematical structure. 
　　also in the   t r i v i a l   translation  properties of the accessibility relation would be expressed 
by clauses at the same level than the other ones characterizing the problem to be solved. this s i tuation would be very similar to the treatment of equality which consists in adding a predicate symbol  =  with clauses to express its properties ; this is known to be the wrong way to do . further on  the use of rewriting techniques seems likely to give better efficiency than paramodulation : see  plotkin 1  for this discussion. 
1 - in this paper we considered resolution  but other classical theorem proving techniques could 
be used for path logic. fo instance techniques based on rewriting  hsiang  dershowitz 1  could be of interest. 
1 - a nice feature of our theory is that the treatment of modalities is finally reduced to unificain an equational theory. unfortunately it is likely that not a l l modal systems can be delt with that 
way : consider a system like g where the property 
of the accessibility relation is of topological 
nature  or some temporal logics with the same 
characteristic. but nothing prohibits to mix the techniques of this paper with other ones  induction for example. this remains to be investigated. also the question of s1 must be considered. 
     on the other hand we can ask which semantical properties can be nicely expressed in the language of path logic.
