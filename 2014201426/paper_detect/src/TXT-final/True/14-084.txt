	i. 	introduction 
　　　there are several a r t i f i c i a l intelligence domains  such as electronic c i r c u i t analysis or chemical engineering  where handling symbolic mathematics is important. while symbolic mathematics packages exist   i   they often prove inadequate to handle the complexity of the symbolic expressions in such domains   1   . this paper proposes some techniques for using assumptions about relative 
magnitudes to simplifyexpressions while maintaining a known degree of accuracy. there is a strong analogy between the proposed technique and the use of exponential notation in the approximate representation of real numbers. 
　　　the necessity of making assumptions about the r e l a t i v e sizes of the values of variables i n t r o duces the p o s s i b i l i t y that they w i l l be proven wrong during the course of solving some set of equations. thus a truth maintenance system   may prove useful in keeping track of the assumptions underlying specific simplifications and solutions. the number of assumptions needed can be reduced by employing constraint propogation  1  as a primary technique for solving equations. 
i i . algebraic simplification 
　　　the f i r s t step in defining an  n s i g n i f i c a n t figure representaion  is to define a canonical polynomial as either an integer constant  a variable  or a polynomial a1xn + a1xn-1 + . . . + a 
where a1 is not 1 and none of the c o e f f i c i n t s a contain the variable x. notice that every canonical polynomial other than 1 takes on a non-zero value for some  in fact most  interpretations of i t s 
variables. 
　　　some way of discussing the r e l a t i v e sizes of variables is needed. each variable x is associated with an order o x  which is some power of ten. it is assumed that x takes on values near o x . the order function o can be extended to a l l non-zero canonical polynomials p in such a way that the 
magnitudes of the values p takes on are usually near o p . the order o p  of a non-zero canonical polynomial p is defined to be o x  for a variable x  1 for an integer constant  and the maximum of the orders of the non-zero terms for a polynomial 
of the above form  where the order of a non-zero term a1xn-1 is defined to be o   a .   o   x   n - 1 . a canonical polynomial is called minimal if it is a variable  an integer constant  or if a l l of i t s non-zero terms are of the same order and each coefficient of each term is minimal. a minimal polynomial can be thought of as containing only that information relevant to determining the value 
of the polynomial to within ten percent. 
　　　an n significant figure polynomial expansion is a pair     p 1   p.  . . . p   e  of an n-tuple of 
minimal canonical polynomials and an integer e such that for each pi either pi equals 1 or o p i   equals 1 . such an expansion is considered equivalent to the expression p1 + p  + . . . + p   there is a strong analogy between n s i g n i f i c a n t figure polynomial expansions and n significant figure expone n t i a l notaion representations of real numbers. finally an n significant figure representaion is defined to be a r a t i o of two n s i g n i f i c a n t figure polynomial expansions and therefore has the following form: 

　　　the truncation of an m s i g n i f i c a n t figure representaion to an n significant figure representation is defined in the obvious way as the result of dropping m-n low order terms form the numerator and denominator. an n significant figure representation is called an n significant figure approximation of an arbitrary rational expression s if it is a t r u n cation of an m s i g n i f i c a n t figure representation 
which is exactly equivalent to s. 
　　　an expression containing real numbers can be approximately evaluated using procedures which add  subtract  multiply and divide n s i g n i f i c a n t figure approximations of reals. the approximate s i m p l i f i c ation of rational algebraic expressions can be done in the same way using procedures which add  subt r a c t   multiply and divide the n s i g n i f i c a n t figure representations defined above. it is r e l a t i v e l y straightforward to define procedures which compute a canonical polynomial equivalent to the sum  d i f ference  or product of two canonical polynomials. from these one can construct procedures which compute n significant figure approximations to the sum  difference  product or quotient of two n s i g n i f i c a n t figure representations. as opposed to standard numeric operations these symbolic s i m p l i f i c a t i o n procedures never perform carries. 

　　　suppose that a is very small  about jo 	. if x is assumed to be on the order of 1 then by dropping unimportant terms form the equation it can be shown that x is almost exactly 1. similarly if x is assumed to be about 1 	then it can be shown that x is almost exactly a  while for x on the order of 1 	x is almost exactly a . such techniques  though well known in engineering and applied mathematics   1     have not been incorporated into computer symbolic mathematics packages. 
　　　in general an expression which is constrained to be zero can be simplified to an n significant figure approximation. to solve for a variable x the the expression should be put in the form ax + b 
where a and b are n significant figure polynomial expansions. then x can be set equal to the n signi f i c a n t f i g u r e s i m p l i f i c a t i o n of - b / a . if the original expression can't be simplified to the desired form it may s t i l l be possible to simplify it to a product expressions each of which is linear in x. in this case one factor must be zero and each factor can be used to give a possible value for x. only those solutions which are of a size consistent with the assumed size of x are viable and if there are no such solutions then the assumption about the size of x must be retracted and some other size t r i e d  perhaps the size of one of the solutions for 
x   . 
　　　this technique can be extended to systems of equations by employing gaussian elimination. first an assumed order o x  is associated with each variable x. then the equations are solved one at a time  each time for a variable which has not yet been solved for. it is possible that during this process some subset of assumptions about the orders of variables is shown to be inconsistent. when this happens an assumption must be retracted and the simplifications and solutions which depended on that assumption must be redone. a truth maintenance system   a  couid prove useful in keeping track of which simplifications and solutions depend on which assumptions. 
　　　simplifications would be less sensitive to changes in the assumed size of variables if they could be based on assumptions of the form  the order of x is less than the order of y  rather than assumptions about the specific sizes of varibles. a truth maintenance system might again prove useful in keeping track of which simplifications remain v a l i d when assumptions change. 
　　　constraint propogation is a technique for solving sets of equations   1     in constraint propogation some subset of variables are a - p r i o r i chosen to be  independent  while others are chosen to be  dependent . dependent variables are eliminated when they can be expressed d i r e c t l y in terms of independent variables via some exact manipulation of a single equation. once an exact value for a dependent variable is found it can be simpl i f i e d to an n significant figure approximation  the s i m p l i f i c a t i o n of exact values can be very expensive without the use of approximations . this has the advantage that assumptions about the sizes of the dependent variables do not need to be made. 
it has the disadvantage that not every set of equations can be solved in this way. it would appear that some mixture of constraint propogatlon and other techniques would be optimal for solving sets of equations under order of magnitude assumptions about variable sizes.
