s algorithm discovery and orchestration. my work developing the pado architecture can be seen in papers such as  1; 1; 1; 1 . 
¡¡neural programming  e.g.    is the last step in a series of improved representations for genetic programming that the thesis will detail. the thesis will describe internal reinforcement  the mechanism for the explanation and improvement of focused elements of evolving programs  in the context of neural programming  e.g.   . 
¡¡my work concentrates on these learning mechanism innovations and in real world signal domains where the signals are typically large and/or poorly understood. this thesis work is unique in three aspects: no general signal classification system currently exists that can learn to classify signals with no space or size penalties for the signal's size or type. no genetic programming system currently exists that purposefully generates and orchestrates a variety of experts along problem specific lines. there is currently no analytically sound mechanism for explaining and reinforcing specific parts of an evolved program. 
the main question that this thesis will answer is: 
   can the genetic programming paradigm be extended  and how far  to apply successfully as a machine learning technique to the general signalto-symbol problem
