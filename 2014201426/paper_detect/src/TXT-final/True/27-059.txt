 
the applicability of lexicographic comparison in nonmonotonic reasoning with specificity is investigated a priority mechanism based on lexicographic comparison is defined for rciter's default logic the following principle - earlier used by geffner and pearl in conditional entailment - is used as the basis for specificity-based priorities for normal default theories for each rule there is a context where it ma  not be defeated by any other rule a method for computing priorities according to the principle is given connection to earlier work is discussed 
1 	introduction 
two kinds of weaknesses have been identified m nonmonotonic logics insensitjvity to specificity  poole  
1  and sensitivity to irrelevant premises |geffner and pearl  1  only the first kind of weakness is present in systems that are defined using some form of maxi mal consistency |reiter  1  moore  1  poole  1  in the well-known example  tweety is a penguin  penguins are birds  penguins usually cannot fly  birds usually can reiter's default logic does not say anything about the flying ability of tweety the rule concerning the flying ability of penguins is more specific than the rule about birds  and the rule about penguins should be used reiter and cnscuolo  l1l  suggest that the application of less specific defaults can be exphcitlj blocked by using semi-normal defaults others introduce priorities  lifschitz  1  konohge  1  brewka  1  
baader and hollunder  1  brewka  1  rintanen  
1  priorities are given as ordenngs of predicates  formulae  or default rules in conflicting situations pref erence is given to items with a higher priority 
　the second land of weakness shows up in logics based on probability  adams  1  pearl  1  and in logics that are defined directly by stating the properties a consequence relation should satibfy  for example the preferential logics of kraus et al  these logics give the correct answers in the standard examples about specificity  for instance concerning tweety's flying ability their weakness is apparent when a set of premises is extended with an irrelevant premise most of the useful consequences are cancelled for example  if tweety

is a black penguin  tweety's inability to fly cannot be inferred 
　in this paper  we investigate the applicability of lexi cographic priorities as a mechanism for resolving default conflicts according to specificity our approach is conservative we do not uropose any original notion of specificity to date  the most successful area in defeasible reasoning - from the point of view of handling both specificity and irrelevant premises - is inheritance reasoning  hortj  1  therefore it seems desirable that solutions to these problems in a more general setting would subsume some form of inheritance reasoning different inheritance theories propose different specificity notions a weak but reasonable principle that is found for example in the preferential logics of kraua et al and that is also respected by inheritance theories is the following given a default that allows the conclusion of 1 from a  the premise a and no other premises  conclude /  this principle is used in the definition of conditional entailment  geffner and pearl  1  and we shall use it in deriving priorities from specificity we strengthen reitcr's default logic with a priority mechanism that uses lexicographic comparison lexicographic comparison has been used in earlier work on explicit priorities  for example in  lifschitz  1  brewka  1 geffner and pearl  1  ryan  1 
　the outline of the paper is as follows in section 1 we present the specificity notion  and in section 1 we extend default logic with a priority mechanism in section 1 we show how nonmonotonic reasoning that respects the specificity notion can be achieved in the extended default logic and how it subsumes an inheritance theory in section 1 we discuss how the specificity principle is too weak 
for default theories in general  claim that priority mech anisms that lexicographically order extensions or models are in general too weak for achieving inheritance-like reasoning  and discuss the possibility of stronger priorities in more general but still restricted cases

next we show how condition 1 can be fulfilled in deska's work reification of inheritance networks is avoided 
fault logic with the lexicographic prionty mechanism deas links can be directly represented as default rules  and 
fined in the preceding section 
the ordering on extensions is justified by condition 1 we restrict to inheritance networks with only defeasible links between classes strict links require stronger priorities or non-normal defaults 
1 	non monotonic reasoning 


1 	beyond inheritance networks 
example 1 demonstrates that it is not sufficient to prioritize defaults the conclusions of which arc contradictory to guarantee that a conflict is solved properly  it is necessary to give a lower priority also to those defaults that potentially become applied if a conflict is resolved in a wrong way in inheritance networks  these defaults can be easily identified  as shown in section 1 this is not the case with default theories in general next we give a variant of example 1 
　a natural line of research is to consider cases where the contingent facts may not contain the kind of problematic implicational formulae used in example 1 a suitable restriction is to require that the consistent facts are propositions! variables or their negations with this restriction satisfactory defeasible reasoning with specificity can hopefully be achieved for a wide class of default theories 
1 	alternative definitions of prioritized reasoning 
the priority mechanism introduced in definition 1 is on!} one of several alternatives that definition classifies defaults to those that are applied in an extension and to those that are not another reasonable classification is to defaults that are not defeated and to defaults that are defeated 


similar examples can be constructed for other systems of prioritized nonmonotonic reasoning that order exten sions or classical models by lexicographic or other form of comparison  for example  geffner and pearl  1  brewka  1  lifechitz  1  ryan  1  gardenfors and makinsoji  1  the presence of disjunctive for mulae in the sets of contingent facts is an obstacle to the possibility of inhentance-like reasoning in systems of default reasoning that use fixed priorities with lexicographic comparison 
each  p-preferred extension is p-preferred1 but not vice versa the generalization of lexicographic comparison to partially ordered positions as given in the definition of preferred hat. been earlier used by brewka |1  the generalization used in preferred1 has been earlier used for example by gfffner and pearl |l1| and ryan |l1  the last two do not explicitly reduce lexicographic comparison with partially ordered positions to lexicographic comparison with totally ordered positions brewka performs lexicographic comparison implicitly in a procedure for computing preferred sets of formulae 
　there are no obvious differences in the expressivity of the priority mechanisms suggested by the above definitions and the one given in section 1 a theorem corresponding to theorem 1 for a priority mechanism that uses defeat instead of application requires stronger priorities than those obtained merely on the basis of condition 1 the reason for this is that in inheritance networks  the number of defaults that are potentially defeated in the intended extensions but not in the unintended extensions  may be increased by extending the set of contingent facts with propositional atoms

1 	related work 
pearl's system z is an improvement over p-entailment  adams  1  and preferential logics of kraus  lehmann and magidor  because it handles irrelevant premises satisfactorily system z imposes an ordering on defaults  the z-ordenng   and models of the defaults are ordered according to the highest defeated default this introduces a new kind of weakness if a member of some class is in some respect exceptional  it is allowed to be exceptional in other respects as well conditional entailment of geffner and pearl  remedies this problem comparison by highest defeated default is replaced by lexicographic comparison that considers significant also violations to defaults below the highest defeated one instead of the z-ordenng  all strict partial orders that together with lexicographic comparison - satisfy a counterpart of condition 1  are used within our framework  conditional entailment can be defined as follows 

delgrande and schaub  and brewka |l1| present methods for computing priorities for reiter's default logic both identify minimal sets of conflicting defaults  delgrande and schaub directly using the z-ordenng of pearl  and brewka using a closeh related idea that takes into account the fact that default rules are unidirectional delgrande and schaub do not use priorities explicitly  but translate sets of defaults and the priority information to sets of semi-normal defaults rules brewka  uses the priorities within his prioritized default logic that is based on a variant of reiter's semiconstructive definition of extension similar priority mechanisms have been independently investigated elsewhere  marek and truszczynski  1  baader and hollunder  1  neither delgrande and schaub nor brewka verify their systems against any correctness criteria or otherwise explicate the specificity notion they use both systems seem to fulfill condition 1 
　default logic with specificity as defined in this paper differs in some aspects from most of the inheritance theories the priorities are fixed  that is  they are the same for all extensions and all sets c of contingent information theories of inheritance have priorities implicitly hidden in the definition of preemption there are examples where fixed priorities necessarily seem to produce too strong conclusions  horty  1  
1 	conclusions 
we have extended reiter's default logic with a lexicographic priority mechanism and presented a method for computing priorities according to specificity the method produces priorities that are sufficiently strong for inheritance networks relaxing two restrictions made in inheritance networks - only propositional atoms as prerequisites and factual knowledge that is not disjunctive - reveals the priorities insufficient it seems that

non-atomic prerequisites can be handled with a lexicographic priority mechanism for a large class default theories  but disjunctive contingent facts cannot 
　our research is closely related to geffher's and pearl's work on conditional entailment  geffner and pearl  1  conditional entailment does not support inheritance reasoning delgrande  extends conditional entailment towards inheritance reasoning our results are likely to have implications on research on that topic 
　the computation of priorities from specificity is rather complex and tightly intertwined with default reasoning itself in argument-based systems of defeasible reasoning  simari and loui  1  pollock  1  these two things are combined there is no division between the reasoning and priority components in these systems this raises questions concerning the usefulness of such division  for example from the computational point of view
