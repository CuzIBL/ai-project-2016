　　　the issues of recognition of and representation for motion concepts  with all their semantic richness  have been largely ignored by the ai community. however  there are exceptions  such as miller   abrahamson   and in particular  badler . badler considered image sequences attempting to provide english descriptions for motions recognized in the images. he 
provided precise definitions for directionals and adverbials and also outlined ideas on representation of the verb semantic components from . 
　　　these works do not claim to solve the problem of motion understanding. firstly  a coherent mechanism is lacking for structuring the defining components of verbs. in addition  temporal relationships between components and a way for determining the duration of a verb from its components are needed. secondly  the design and control structures of a system which accepts visual input and recognizes motion concepts has not been outlined in much detail. 
　　　this short note describes on-going work in these two areas and is detailed in 
. 
　　　frames  are used for structuring verb definitions and have the following characteristics. there are slots with selectional restrictions which become bound to participating objects in the scene. functional relations  active knowledge components  between concepts  particularly temporal concepts  are needed  such as 
mathematical relations and concepts which aid in determination of which of the recog-
nized objects f i l l which slots. prerequisites act as triggers for activation of the frame. these prerequisites correspond exactly to the semantic components of the verb  1. instantiation of a frame occurs only after the following has taken place: the frame is activated; each of its prerequisites must be instantiated; all temporal relationships must be verified; and  the duration of the verb must be determined. the start-time of the verb is the maximum value of the start-times of its prerequisites  while the end-time is the minimum of their end-times. that i s   a l l prerequisites must exist during a common time interval. if this condition is violated  the frame is de-activated  and the condition is checked on recognition of the startand end-times for each prerequisite. 
　　　a frame interpreter has been implemented which performs the above functions. however  it also performs one other 
       the necessary c o n t r o l s t r u c t u r e s are now o u t l i n e d .  the o v e r a l l s t r u c t u r e is s i m i l a r t o t h a t d e s c r i b e d b y freuder   1   .   there is an independent low l e v e l module which can r e c o g n i z e o b j e c t s in the scene  compute s p a t i a l r e l a t i o n s between o b j e c t s on command  and r e c o g n i z e when an o b j e c t changes l o c a t i o n  assuming a s t a t i o n a r y o b s e r v e r   . i t i n d e p e n d e n t l y i n s t a n t i a t e s o b j e c t s i n the scene and t h e i r l o c a t i o n s . the s p a t i a l r e l a t i o n s are computed o n l y when it is q u e r i e d about an o b j e c t . the o t h e r major module is the frame i n t e r p r e t e r a s d e s c r i b e d above. i t s o t h e r f u n c t i o n i s to p r o v i d e guidance f o r the low l e v e l . a frame concept is a c t i v a t e d by the i n s t a n t i a t i o n o f one o f i t s p r e r e q u i s i t e s . howe v e r   the f a c t t h a t the o b j e c t moves cannot be one of the a c t i v a t i n g p r e r e q u i s i t e s because t h i s would a c t i v a t e a l l frames. for t h i s f a c t   the i n t e r p r e t e r q u e r i e s the low l e v e l about b a s i c s p a t i a l r e l a t i o n s f o r the o b j e c t . o n a c t i v a t i o n   the i n t e r p r e t e r then q u e r i e s the low l e v e l about the r e maining p r e r e q u i s i t e s . the low l e v e l performs computations to determine when and if these are i n s t a n t i a t e d u n t i l i t i s i n s t r u c t e d t o d e l e t e these from i t s query l i s t  when the frame is d e - a c t i v a t e d   . 
       a b a s i c q u e s t i o n here is whether or not the low l e v e l becomes swamped w i t h q u e r i e s d u r i n g p r o c e s s i n g of the scene. in the simple scenes c o n s i d e r e d   an i n t e r e s t i n g f a c t was observed which is a l s o r e p o r t e d i n   1   . the query l i s t grows unt i l p a r t way t h r o u g h the scene and then s h r i n k s in s i z e as concepts are i n s t a n t i a t e d .
