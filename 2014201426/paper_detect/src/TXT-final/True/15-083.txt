 
　　nonmonotonic logics are logics in which theorems can be invalidated by new axioms. in t h i s paper we propose a general framework in which a large class of non-
monotonic logics can be specified. 
1. introduction 
traditional logics are monotonic -
i . e .   theorems of any theory belong to 
the set of theorems of any extension of the theory. in human reasoning the s i t u a t i o n is d i f f e r e n t : one's knowledge often makes impossible to i n f e r on the pure l o g i c a l basis  yet some conclusion has to be drawn. such a conclusion  called bel i e f in ai terminology  can be invalidated 
when new l o g i c a l information is added. it means that common sense reasoning violates the p r i n c i p l e of monotonicity. 
　　a possible approach to the problem of formalization of beliefs is that of mcdermott and doyle   1 j . they consider the concept of consistency as modality. unfortunately  they have no l o g i c a l a x i oms and inference rules specific f o r that 
notion. in consequence  t h e i r nonmonotonic logic is too weak. 
　　mcdermott   1  improves the above logic by supplying some axioms and inference r u l e s . this extension results in nonmonotonic versions of the t r a d i t i o n a l modal systems t  s1  and s1. unfortunately  the systems s1 and t are too weak to capture a l l properties of the notion of consistency  and his nonmonotonic version of s1 turns out to be equivalent to the monotonic modal s1 l o g i c . 
　　in the following paper we propose a general framework in which  we t h i n k   a 
　　formalization of beliefs based on the not i o n of consistency  can properly be handled. our approach d i f f e r s from that of mcdermott in the way in which the notion of nonmonotonic theorem is specified. while both approaches make use of an a l gebraic operator f o r that purpose  our operator is more general. by means of it a large class of nonmonotonic logics can be defined. for each logic a model-theor e t i c semantics is given and the completeness theorem is stated. 
　　proposing such a general approach we do not suggest that a l l of those logics are of some importance. in fact  only very few of them are interesting. the problem of choosing such an ideal logic is very complex. in this paper we propose a solution to the problem for a specific class of theories. 
　　for the sake of simplicity we work within propositional language. it should be  however  remarked that a l l results can easily be generalized to the f i r s t order language  
1. language 
　　the language under consideration contains: the set of proposition letters denoted by p q p1 q1 ..; the connectives    not        i f . . . then ; the modal operator m   i t is consistent that ; the brackets       . a formula is either a proposition letter  an expression    α   where α is a formula  or an expression   Αcb    where α and b are formulas. other connectives are defined as usual. the modal operator l   i t is provable that   is an abbreviation for m α. the brackets can be omitted if convenient.
