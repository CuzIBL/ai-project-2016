       papers ' ' ' have been presented h i t h e r to concerning robot planning systems t h a t understand i n s t r u c t i o n s from an operator and which make plans f o r a t t a i n i n g g o a l s . 
       this paper describes a robot planning system developed f o r use in a r o b o t . this system is concerned w i t h a robot with a hand and an eye which manipulates b u i l d i n g - b l o c k s in response to the orders of an operator. 
       two d i f f e r e n t kinds of theorem provers are used to demonstrate the e f f e c t i v e n e s s of t h i s planning system. one is based on the r e s o l u t i o n p r i n c i p l e   the other on p a t t e r n matching. the former is used in a problem s o l v e r which understands the meaning of a statement and which decides a goal s t a t e corresponding to the statement. the l a t t e r is applied to a problem solver which e f f e c t s a concrete job sequence to r e a l i ze the goal s t a t e described above. these problem solvers are c a l l e d goal-finder and job-scheduler r e s p e c t i v e l y . 
       the reason why two theorem provers are used in a robot planning system is t h a t it is not n e c e s s a r i l y p r o f i t a b l e to process two operations  f o r example t h a t of r e p r e s e n t i n g a 
       s t a t e and of o b t a i n i n g a job sequence  w i t h only one method. 
       a f u r t h e r f e a t u r e of t h i s planning system is t h a t the procedural data s t r u c t u r e is used f o r i n c r e a s i n g e f f i c i e n c y i n problem s o l v i n g processes. an o u t l i n e of the robot planning system  d e s c r i p t i o n s of each of the problem solvers and f u t u r e considerations are given in the f o l l o w i n g chapters. 
       the problem solvers and the robot p l a n n i n g system discussed in t h i s paper would undoubtedly be a p p l i c a b l e in many f i e l d s . 
1. 	the o u t l i n e s of the 	robot planning system 
       the f o l l o w i n g problem is presented as an example of the working of a robot planning system. there are many blocks  of various shapes and c o l o u r s   and working desks upon which a robot manipulates the b l o c k s . the robot is made to b u i l d s t r u c t u r e s   such as a tower  a house  a b r i d g e   e t c .   in response to task i n s t r u c t i o n given by an operator to the robot in a r e s t i c t e d form as f o l l o w s ; 
 build a tower  
 build a house with a red roof   e t c . 
the robot attempts to determine the meanings of words or phrases  such as  a tower    a house  and   w i t h a red r o o f     from i t s knowledge. i f i t f a i l s   i t asks the operator t o explain the meanings. the meanings of the concepts   tower    house  and   r o o f     are given to the robot as axi oms in the form of f i r s t - o r d e r predicate calculus w f f s . i n t e r p r e t i n g the statement  the robot decides on a s u i t a b l e s t a t e - r e p r e s e n t a t i o n f o r a block b u i l d i n g . this s t a t e - r e p r e s e n t a t i o n i s c a l l e d a goal s t a t e and is shown in the form of   on a  on c d   v   where  on x y  means  x is on y . 
       the theorem prover based on the r e s o l u t i o n p r i n c i p l e and on the f u n c t i o n a l data s t r u c t u r e is used as a main t o o l in t h i s p a r t of the robot planning system. this p a r t in the system is called  goal-finder . finding the goal s t a t e s u i t a b l e f o r the statement  the robot must define a job sequence for c o n s t r u c t i n g the b u i l d i n g . that i s   a robot roust 
decide the procedure to r e a l i z e the goal s t a t e 
under some c o n s t r a i n t s . a theorem prover based on p a t t e r n matching is applied to t h i s process. the theorem prover t h a t c o n s t i t u t e s t h i s p a r t of the system is called  jobscheduler  . 
       taking the goal s t a t e and the present s t a t e   job-scheduler decides a job sequence given the c o n s t r a i n t s of the block w o r l d . 
　　　a diagram of the robot planning system is shown in f i g . 1  the d e t a i l s of goal-finder 
and job-scheduler are described in chapters 1 and 1. 
       the r e l a t i o n s h i p s between the blocks manipulated by a robot and the c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the blocks  ex. shape  colour  p o s i t i o n   e t c .   are represented by fds*. fds forms a network and blocks w i t h s i m i l a r c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s are connected. therefore  the sui t a b l e problem domain may be e f f e c t i v e l y established by the problem s o l v e r . for example  the problem domain composed of only red blocks can be e x t r a c t e d from the block world in response to the statement. 
	1. 	an i n p u t i n t e r p r e t e r and goal-fikder 
       in t h i s chapter  we s h a l l describe an i n t e r p r e t e r which construes i n p u t statements given by an operator and a s t a t e - o r i e n t e d 
       problem s o l v e r   goal-finder  which f i n d s a goal s t a t e t o f u l f i l l the statements. 
       goal-finder is made up of three major p a r t s   a world model  a storage  which 
* 	fds is an a b b r e v i a t i o n of f u n c t i o n a l data s t r u c t u r e .

memorizes knowledge of concepts of block b u i l d i n g s   	and the r e s o l u t i o n theorem prover. this theorem prover is s i m i l a r to 	qa1. 
1 	an i n p u t i n t e r p r e t e r and a world model 
       the main functions of t h i s i n t e r p r e t e r are to t r a n s l a t e statements 	into 	l i s t forms and to d e l i v e r them to goal-finder. 	in the present stage  	task statements given by an operator are r e s t r i c t e d 	to the f o l l o w i n g two types 	f o r the sake of s i m p l i c i t y . 
build a d j e c t i ve noun w i t h a d j e c t i v e noun move a d j e c t i v e noun to p. 
 where each a d j e c t i v e word or clause may be missing  and p represents the place where objects should be moved.  for example  
        build a tall tover vith a red pillar  is transformed i n t o 
       build  tower tall  pillar red    and such a statement as 
 move blue block to place-a  
yi elds 
move place-a  block blue . 
       in a d d i t i o n to 	imperative statements  t h i s 	i n t e r p r e t e r 	construes 	two 	types 	of d e c l a r a t i v e sentences w r i t t e n in the form of well 	formed formulas 	 wffs  in the predicate c a l c u l u s . 	one type is a statement 	for 	changing the world model 	and the other is f o r changing knowledge. 	the i n t e r p r e t e r also p r i n t s out the message when the planning system f a i l s to perform i t s f u n c t i o n   	and requires 	f u r t h e r 	i n s t r u c t i o n s . 
       fds is employed to describe such world models as those described by shape  name  colour  	p o s i t i o n and s p a t i a l 	r e l a t i o n s h i p s of the blocks. 	one feature of t h i s program is i ts a b i l i ty to make up an associative network of current i n f o r m a t i o n in the world. 
       because of t h i s s t r u c t u r e   a l l features of the block can be seen e a s i l y   and blocks having s p e c i f i c features can be selected. 
1 algorithms used in a problem solver which finds goal states 
       here  ve s h a l l discuss the algorithms used in t h i s problem solver  and explain how it f i n d s a goal state which is s u i t a b l e f o r task statement. an o u t l i n e of the problem s o l v i n g process i s i l l u s t r a t e d i n f i g . 1 . i n explanation  l e t u s b r i e f l y o u t l i n e i t s processes. 
       f i r s t   the problem solver generates theorems to be proved corresponding to the statement  and second it chooses the axioms whi ch are 
necessary to prove the theorems and sets them up in each problem domain. 
       t h i r d l y i t selects appropriate blocks from a world model and sets them up in each problem domain . 
	in conclusion  	it proves theorems and 
	produces a s o l u t i o n   	i . e . a goal s t a t e . 
       these algorithms have the f o l l o w i n g three notable 	c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s . 
　　　 1  because axioms are constructed in a tree s t r u c t u r e   the meanings of statements are 
r e f l e c t e d systematically in the theorem proving process. 
        1  some a d j e c t i v e words in a statement are r e f l e c t e d in the process of s e l e c t i n g axioms. for example  an a d d i t i o n a l axiom which can produce t a l l b u i l d i n g w i l l be selected to build a  tall tover  rather than an ordinary tower. 
        1  other a d j e c t i v e words are r e f l e c t e d 
       in the processes by which blocks are s e l e c t e d . for example  only blue blocks are selected from a world model to b u i l d a  blue house . let us b r i e f l y describe the knowledge shown in fig.. 1. the knowledge  we discuss here  involves the axioms  which the theorem prover is to use  and the generalized s o l u t i o n s   where the generalized s o l u t i o n means a wffs which has been obtained by r e p l a c i n g constants in a s o l u t i o n by the corresponding 
	predicate 	l e t t e r s . 
　　　for example  suppose a s o l u t i o n is   on a b   and the f o l l o w i n g d e s c r i p t i o n s are given; 
prism  a  and block  b . 
         on prism block   is stored as a generalized s o l u t i o n and u t i l i z e d in subsequent processes. each piece of knowledge concerning an axiom consists of the name  the l e v e l   the corresponding a d j e c t i v e and the axiom i t s e l f and is stored in the form of l i s t s t r u c t u r e s . the axioms are gi ven to the problem solver  goal-finder  in the form of predicate calculus w f f s . each axiom may or may not have l e v e l i n g marks to represent the concepts  for example   house    tover  e t c .   in the tree s t r u c t u r e s . 
　　　using the axioms w i t h the l e v e l i n g marks  e f f i c i e n c y of procedure in goal-pinder can be g r e a t l y increased. 
       in t h i s case  the theorem prover i n t e r pretes thie tree s t r u c t u r e of a concept and introduces a s o l u t i o n containing the r e a l obj ects. 
　　　as f u r t h e r explanations  ve shall use a simple example. 
	 example 	1  
suppose the task statement i s 
 build a tall tower vith a blue pillar.  
and the world model is as shown in f i g . 1 -   1   . in t h i s example  the f o l l o w i n g two theorems to be proved are induced; 
 1x  tover  x  
 1x  pillar  x . 
       the axioms are gathered in the f o l l o w i n g manner; 
tover; l e v e l 1  vxvy     roof x  pillar y   
;   tover  on x y       *   
	roof; l e v e l   	 vx    prism x  	1   roofx    
	pillar; 	l e v e l 1 	 vx   brick x 1 pillar x

and 

　　　the l a s t axiom is selected because there e x i s t s an a d j e c t i v e word tall in the i n s t r u c t i o n . 
　　　the tree s t r u c t u r e of axioms and theorems is shown in pig  	1. 
       in t h i s f i g u r e   the a d j e c t i v e tall belongs to the tower but it a c t u a l l y has an e f f e c t on the axiom of pillar w i t h l e v e l 1. in a d d i t i o n   the a d j e c t i v e blue has an effect on the process of s e t t i n g up the problem domain. that i s   goal-finder sets up the world of only blue blocks as the s o l u t i o n thus -
pillar  on a c . 
       this is s u b s t i t u t e d i n t o the axiom of tower using only prisms. the s o l u t i o n obtained is as f o l l o w s ; 
tower  on e  on a c     .

	1. 	job-scheduler 
       suppose we supply the robot w i t h the world model  	the i n i t i a l 	s t a t e and the goal s t a t e   	and ask it to decide a sequence of actions to achieve the goal s t a t e . 	there are  of course  	many c o n s t r a i n t s in the world of the r o b o t . 	these c o n s t r a i n t s can be c l a s s i f i e d 	i n t o 	the f o l l o w i n g two categories; 
        1  actions r e s t r i c t i o n s which are i n v a r i a b l y accompanied by an a c t i o n   and 
        1  states l i m i t a t i o n s which are provided by the w o r l d . 
in t h i s chapter a problem s o l v e r   	job-scheduler  	is used to produce a sequence of actions to a t t a i n the goal 	s t a t e . 
1 	theorem prover used in job-scheduler 
       a plannner-like theorem prover1 is used to solve a job sheduling problem in order to o b t a i n an action-sequence which w i l l a r r i v e at a goal s t a t e from a current s t a t e w h i l s t under some c o n s t r a i n t s . because of the f l e x i b i l i t y 
of d e s c r i b i n g a l g o r i t h m s   two kinds of theorems are used in t h i s theorem prover. they are as f o l l o w s : 
         l   a theorem of which the r e s u l t is described as a s t a t e when the a c t i o n has a clear e f f e c t on the w o r l d . for example  such an a c t i o n as  put x on y  creates a s t a t e  x is on j  j the p a i r of the a c t i o n and the s t a t e becomes a general knowledge whereby the a c t i o n corresponding to a s t a t e is d i r e c t l y o b t a i n e d ; and 
* in these expressions e x i s t e n t i a l q u a n t i f i e r s had already been e l i m i n a t e d and the skolem f u n c t i o n s which represent the meanings of these q u a n t i f i e r s i n t r o d u c e d . 
        1  a theorem which describes procedures; t h i s theorem gives the procedure of execution  s o t h a t i t i s s u i t a b l e f o r the d e s c r i p t i o n o f 
       an a l g o r i t h m . as f a r as the c o n t r o l of execution is concerned  the c o n s t r a i n t is described  1  in a theorem  as a p r e c o n d i t i o n p e c u l i a r to the robot system. or the cons t r a i n t is described  1  as a v a r i a b l e c o n d i t i o n to be r e f e r r e d according to the s i t u a t i o n s . 
       when a c o n d i t i o n a l expression in a theorem is not s a t i s f i e d   	the c o n t r o l of the program may be changed according to the i n d i c a t i o n f o r   f     	if the i n d i c a t i o n is the name of a l a b e l used in the same theorem  	the c o n t r o l becomes a simple jump l i k e the  go to  statement of the fortran  	on the other hand  i f i t i s n o t   	i t w i l l b e i n t e r p r e t e d a s a 
       branch of a new theorem and the f o l l o w i n g behaviours processed. 	the d i r e c t e d process is peformed and then the c o n t r o l returns to the branching p o i n t . 	i f the c o n d i t i o n a l 	expression i s s t i l l not s a t i s f i e d   	the c o n t r o l returns to l a s t d e c i s i o n p o i n t and a new 
d e c i s i o n is made.
