knowledge engineers  can help them gain a quantitative understanding of reasoning performance of knowledge acquired at the  early  stages of the development l i f e cycle  and enable them to make a numeric comparison and a choice among several structures  or have some refinements. this paper also presents some application examples of this evaluating method and describes an evaluating f a c i l i t y based on i t . 
i introduction 
   in the last decade  expert systems and tools for building them have been being developed at a surprisingly rapid rate  waterman  1 . this makes evaluation of expert system more and more important in its development process. as pointed out in  gaschnig  et a l .   1   evaluations pervade the expert system building process and are crucial for improving system design and performance  but the existing techniques for evaluating these systems are few and primitive. certainly many evaluating methods used in other software systems  shneiderman  1  could be applied to expert systems  but an expert system is unique in the sense that it is a knowledge-based system containing human expertise  and has many distinguishing features such as heuristic searching  reasoning  high level representation   etc.. therefore  
expert system should have its own evaluating techniques. 
gaschnig and others 	in 	their 	paper have presented many general evaluating c r i t e r i a concerning on what  how  and when the evaluation should be .performed. our approach   on the other hand  emphasizes the performance of inference structure which means complexity  costs or efficiency in the context of this paper  i.e  the degree of d i f f i c u l t y   e f f o r t   or the reasonable time for a system with such an inference structure to attain certain goals. as was proposed in  newell  1   there does exist a distinct computer system level  the knowledge level  lying immediately above the program level. accordingly  our point is that this evaluation is performed at the knowledge level whereas the others for common software systems are performed at the program level. 
¡¡j. mcdermott  et al.cmcdermott  et a l .   1  have f i r s t made an approach and presented several exciting results on the efficiency of certain production system implementations focusing on impacts of conflict set finding strategies. the evaluating method presented here is towards the inference structure i t s e l f   as the reasoning network constituted by the intrinsic relationships of knowledge has a great influence on the performance of expert system. 
¡¡the application significance of this evaluating method has been shown in the sense that it helps knowledge 
engineers 
    1  obtain a quantitative measure of inference performance of acquired knowledge. example 1  for instance  gives the evaluating result of an expert system. 
    1  make a numeric comparison of performance among several structures  normally with the same function in problem solving . for instance  example 
1 analyzes the impacts of a generalization strategy on the inference performance  and example 1 compares two mechanisms for pattern consistency checking.

seems to be a major l i m i t a t i o n of the a p p l i c a t i o n which excludes the s e l f r e f e r e n c i n g inference t r a n s i t i o n s i n the system. when such a system l i k e mycin is c o n f r o n t e d   the a d d i t i o n a l mechanism is needed to avoid reasoning loops  so is the propagation process 
s t a t e d in section i i i to prevent the computing loops. the s i m i l a r problem has also been explored in  he&yu  1   and the s o l u t i o n can be the marking method 
discussed in  buchanan&short l i f e   1  or o t h e r s . another problem arises in 
d e t e r m i n i n g the performance f a c t o r of t r a n s i t i o n s and the size of s t a t e   
which r e q u i r e s the a b s t r a c t i o n is performed under a f i x e d standard. one of the f u r t h e r d i r e c t i o n of t h i s approach is to explore the volume f a c t o r of inference s t r u c t u r e   which 
has been i n v e s t i g a t e d as f '   l   in our work  but i t s a p p l i c a t i o n s i g n i f i c a n c e remains to be c l a r i f i e d . 
   it should be noted that although t h i s method is motivated f o r r u l e or knowledge-source based reasoning network  example 1 below  however  is to evaluate two p a t t e r n - c o n s i s t e n c y checkers  which i n d i c a t e s that the inference s t r u c t u r e is a k i n d of the c o g n i t i v e modeling of human reasoning. the a p p l i c a t i o n scope of t h i s method is t h e r e f o r e extended f u r t h e r . 
   the f o l l o w i n g examples show the a p p l i c a t i o n s i g n i f i c a n c e o f t h i s method. the performance f a c t o r of each t r a n s i t i o n is assigned as 1  x f u n c t i o n
