introduction 
frump  fast reading understanding and memory 
program  is a system being developed at yale to skim newspaper s t o r i e s . the united press i n t e r n a t i o n a l news service has r e c e n t l y been connected to the yale computer to provide frump w i t h r e a l - w o r l d data. frump's understanding is based on the concept of a s c r i p t . a s c r i p t is a data s t r u c t u r e used to represent knowledge about very s t y l i z e d events. 
	frump uses what we c a l l 	 sketchy 	s c r i p t s   . 
the c r u c i a l d i f f e r e n c e between sketchy s c r i p t s and the d e t a i l e d s c r i p t s used in other yale proj e c t s   c u l l i n g f o r d   1  is that only the concepts corresponding to the most important events in a d e t a i l e d s c r i p t are i n c l u d e d . each of these important events is represented by a  request  in 
conceptual dependency format. the requests cont a i n blank s l o t s that are f i l l e d when the story is processed. there is a d i f f e r e n t sketchy s c r i p t for each type of newspaper story t h a t frump can process. the blank s l o t s are the s c r i p t v a r i a b l e s f o r that s c r i p t . a t t h i s w r i t ing frump can understand s i x types of news events: earthquakes  v e h i c l e a c c i d e n t s   heads of states d y i n g   f l o o d s   m i l i t a r y f i g h t i n g and meetings of heads of s t a t e . we expect frump to have many more s c r i p t s by the end of the summer. for frump  understanding is marking the proper requests as s a t i s f i e d and binding i t s s c r i p t v a r i a b l e s to things found in the t e x t . 
       frump is made up of two p a r t s : 	the 	concept u a l fragment parser and the s c r i p t a p p l i e r . 	the parser was i n s p i r e d by becker's 	phrasal 	l e x i c o n  becker 	1 . 	it 	t r i e s to s a t i s f y the requests of the sketchy s c r i p t w i t h sentences or fragments of 	sentences from the i n p u t . 	the s c r i p t a p p l i e r guides the parser in s e l e c t i n g meanings 	f o r 	ambiguous 	phrases  	binds 	s c r i p t 	v a r i a b l e s   	and loads new requests 	when 	a p p r o p r i a t e . 	the 	top down 	nature 	of frump allows it to be very e f f i c i e n t . 	a news s t o r y is 	t y p i c a l l y 	processed 	in ten 	seconds of cpu time on a dec ka1 processor. classification 1 	news stories 
¡¡¡¡¡¡a f i l e is maintained of understood news events. each f i l e entry consists of the requests and bound s c r i p t v a r i a b l e s of the sketchy s c r i p t used f o r understanding that event. before a 
the research described in t h i s paper was supported by the advanced research projects agency of the department of defense and monitored by the o f f i c e of naval research under c o n t r a c t 
n1-c-1. 
s t o r y can be processed  frump must c l a s s i f y the s t o r y  to select the proper sketchy s c r i p t   and decide whether it is an update of a previous s t o r y or a r e p o r t of a new event. this is done by making an i n i t i a l scan through the f i r s t paragraph of the s t o r y w i t h a special set of r e quests a c t i v e . the set of requests is made up of one key request from each of frump's s c r i p t s . a key request is a request which  if s a t i s f i e d   s t r o n g l y i n d i c a t e s that the associated s c r i p t is a p p r o p r i a t e f o r understanding the s t o r y . when one of these requests is s a t i s f i e d   frump knows not only what s c r i p t to use but also  from the s c r i p t v a r i a b l e s of the request  some i n f o r m a t i o n about t h i s p a r t i c u l a r s t o r y . that i n f o r m a t i o n is matched against the corresponding information of p r e v i o u s l y understood s t o r i e s to decide if the new s t o r y is an update. for a more complete des c r i p t i o n of frump  see  dejong  1 . 
an example 
       the f o l l o w i n g consists of the lead paragraphs of an actual a r t i c l e . the summaries are produced by canned templates. the templates contain blanks f i l l e d by p r o p e r t i e s of the s c r i p t v a r i a b l e s . since the i n t e r n a l representation is conceptual dependency  it is as easy to generate summaries in spanish and russian as e n g l i s h .
