introduction 
f u n c t i o n a l l y   question-answering systems and computer-aided i n s t r u c t i o n a l systems  cai-systems  are s i m i l a r   and it seems appropriate to t r a n s f e r al-techniques developed for q/a-systems  1  to caisystems. but so f a r   research on q/asystems has not given much thought to the questions a user could or should be asked  or how the system's reply should be expressed as to be e a s i l y understandable by the user. these features are not only r e quired in t u t o r a l dialogue  but should also be present in any i n t e r a c t i v e system  where at least two partners j o i n t l y s t r i v e to achieve a g o a l   and each may request use of the c a p a b i l i t i e s of the other. c l e a r l y   a teacher needs some knowledge of his student's knowledge and goals aside from knowledge about subject matter. that knowledge is referred to as a usermodel. other i n t e r a c t i v e applications l i k e operating systems  debuggers for programming languages  or i n f o r m a t i o n - r e t r i e v a l systems would also benefit from e x p l i c i t l y considering a model of the user in preparing t h e i r messages. 
we w i l l o u t l i n e  1  how subject-matter knowledge may be represented in semantic n e t s   and then  1  how planning of i n s t r u c t i o n is directed by an i n s t r u c t i o n a l model. 
building semantic nets in a subject area 
scholar by carbonell  1  and sophie by 
brown  1  are examples of the use of a semantic net for representing subject-
matter knowledge and using it in generating problems  or answering queries. simmons has hypothesized that semantic nets may serve as the central cognitive structure  1 . we w i l l show how a semant i c net of a subject-matter area can be b u i l t  using the notation of   1       and how the notion of a semantic net may be expanded in order to achieve qreater f l e x i b i l i t y i n using i t . 
basic objects and r e l a t i o n s 
f i r s t   c e r t a i n concepts are decided to be p r e - r e q u i s i t e and known to any student. some objects and r e l a t i o n s are also used as p r i m i t i v e s in the problem-solving component of the system. the r e l a t i o n  northof  may e i t h e r be assumed basic or explained to the student in terms of l a t i tude  as well as computed in terms of l a t i t u d e . in choosing basic r e l a t i o n s and o b j e c t s   it has to be considered that natu r a l language sentences may be conven i e n t l y generated. 
concept nodes 
secondly  the concepts to be taught are defined in terms of r e l a t i o n - o b j e c t t u p les   l i k e a lisp property l i s t   . e.g. if 
we teach  say  chinese cookery   some bas ic objects may be: r i c e   soy-sauce  pan e t c .   and some basic r e l a t i o n s are: i n q r e d i e n t - o f   made-by  shape e t c . . an obj e c t l i k e a  wok  is not basic because the student might need to know that it is l i k e an iron pan  having a b o w l - l i k e shape with two handles  and is used mainly in a cooking method c a l l e d   s t i r - f r y i n g   : 

several questions about a  wok  may be asked by the student  and it is possible to r e t r i e v e respective answers. generall y   it is a problem to decide  how many nodes deep we s h a l l go i n t o the net when r e t r i e v i n g the subnet used for the answer. carbonell  1  used irrelevancy tags as weights to determine the subnet included in the answer. we f e e l that t h i s is a weak point in scholar  and that the r e l e vancy should rather be determined on the basis of an i n s t r u t i o n a l model.

situation nodes or frames 
finally  concept no serve as building blocks for larger structures capable of expressing situations  events and compositions of events. a situation can be thought of approximately as the description of part of the  hypothetical  world at an instance. again  teaching  chinese cookery   we may describe the i n i t i a l s i t uation before preparing a course by l i s ting each ingredient  respective amount  state of preparation  tools  relative position etc.. anything altering a given situation is called an event . the description of an event should express the changes it w i l l make  if applied to the network structure representing that s i t uation. as a consequence it is natural to allow compositions of events  nested  sequential or parallel concatenations . in order to include such knowledge  semantic nets require procedures within them. 
we follow minsky's notion of a frame  as a data structure for representing a stereotyped situation  1   and interpret it for representing subject-matter in an i n structional system:  a frame is a collection of questions to be asked about a hypothetical situation; it specifies i s sues raised and methods to be used in dealing with them.   minsky  1  . organizing a curriculum for a cai-course should then start by identifying such situations  applicable questions  and the ways they are connected  rather than building a  hierarchy of principles   gagne  1  . some of the questions associated with a 
situation might be  what concepts are prerequisite  how a similar situation would look  which solutions are possible  or 
methods could be t r i e d   etc.. we shall not dig further here now  but look for a way to extend the computational aspect of a semantic net in order to give it some of the capabilities of a frame-system. a frame d i f f e r s from a conventional node in a semantic net in the sense that: 
 a  before any node being pointed to  terminal  is accessed from a frame head  an applicability test is made. if it f a i l s   a l i s t of alternative frames is made available. if it succeeds  it may determine which arcs to access and in what order. 
 b  if a frame is accessed  it may take over control and not return to the calling frame. 
 c  the terminals may specify conditions that have to be satisfied. these conditions are functions that may have as arguments values of other terminals of this frame  or a frame through which the current frame has been previously activated. if the condition f a i l s   a default value is given.

when control is regained  return to caller.  
the basic operations of creating  storing  retrieving  and removing concept nodes are handled by standard lisp-functions. for frames such functions must be redefined. also  nodes should be retrievable by pattern-directed invocation  1 . the development of such tools promises to be valuable for implementing a teaching system more versatile than scholar. nevertheless it was scholar which motivated these reflections. 
planning instruction 
assume  a semantic net representing knowledge in a subject-area has been b u i l t along these lines. how could an algorithm to teach it be designed  one approach is to wait for a user query  understand i t   invoke the frame s  relevant to i t   and c a l l a procedure which generates a natural language reply. a different way is to let the system decide what the current goal of instruction should be  and proceed as before. since the i n i t i a t i v e of the dialogue is either on the system's or on the user's side  carbonell used the term mixed-init i a t i v e dialogue to express that scholar enabled both modes  1 . but it is important to notice  that both modes need a specification of the dialoaue's goal. the user's query must be understood as a further specification of the  possibly vaguely expressed or implied  instructional goal. its meaning depends upon the context of previous dialogue  assumptions about the user's knowledge  and the purpose of instruction. 
a human instructor  hopefully  knows what he wants to instruct  and also takes note of what he believes his student has a l ready understood. sometimes  before starting to teach a new concept  he makes sure that the student has grasped alle pre-requisite concepts by asking questions. the student's answer is then used for updating his notes. this illustrates some of a human teacher's intelligence. how can it be made a r t i f i c i a l   
let 	us 	d e f i n e 	an 	instructional 	model 	as 	a representation of  1  goals of instruction   1  methods to achieve their  and  1  a user model. the goals may be formulated in terms of a set of concepts the student can apply to a set of situations. these goals may be modified by particular user preferences. the methods include general  hence transferable knowledge a teacher has. the user model contains the history of understood concepts and solved problems  a 
description of situation features the user is likely to be motivated by  and possibly some characteristics of his ability  like reading speed  preferences for inductive or deductive reasoning  forgetting factor etc. . the function of an instructional model within a cai-system would be to search the semantic net  retrieve the frames to be taught  match their pre-req-
uisites with the prior knowledge of the student and interpret user queries and answers as updates of the instructional model. 
a cai-system should explicitly incorporate such model  but presently only few attempts have been made to do so  1 . the traditional approaches to this problem using decision theory and stochastic learning models  1 1  have reached a 
dead end due to their oversimplified representation of learning. the reason for stochastic learning models failing as 
models for instruction is their lack of representing the content to be taught. the teacher's decision can in general only be made  if he knows what is understood  but not the probability that a specific response will be given to a specific stimulus. 
a new approach would be to express the instructional model as a structure of goaldirected processes  in a language such as conniver  1  or planner  1  . we can sketch the idea for a  overly simplistic  f i r s t approximation to such algorithm: 
let the goal of instruction be that the student can solve problems generatable from a list of situation nodes of the network. this l i s t could be a tree implying a default ordering of concepts  e.g. in terms of the pre-requisite relation . in planning his next move  the instructor takes a node from this l i s t   and tries to find out whether it is answerable by the user model. 
a problem generated from a situation node is answerable if its listed pre-requisites are marked as known or if a problem-solving procedure containing only steps previously demonstrated in other situations can be successfully applied. the function that evaluates whether a problem is answerable may in case of failure return a l i s t of unknown pre-requisites  and also recommend other frames to be examined f i r s t . 
to find whether a pre-requisite is met  or a substep in a solution sequence is available to the user  the model may yield in-

i f i t t u r n s out t h a t a p r e - r e q u i s i t e c o n cept is necessary  we search f o r a node designed to examplify i t . the net is b u i l t to f a c i l i t a t e such search by having  exa m p l e   - a r c s from concepts to frames. a l s o   s p e c i a l procedures f o r g e n e r a t i n g examples may be c o n s t r u c t e d : find a p r e v i o u s s i t u a t i o n where the s o l u t i o n would have been s i m p l i f i e d through the use of t h a t concept  or a s i t u a t i o n which in case a t e r m i n a l is bound d i f f e r e n t l y r e q u i r e s t h a t concept i n o r d e r to be answerable.
