introduction 
　　　in this paper two major components of the speech understanding system are discussed. one is a feature e x t r a c t i o n method for the speech wave and the other is a sentence recognition algorithm. many speech pattern recognition systems have been made to c l a s s i f y spoken words and a few have been t r i e d to treat spoken sentences. a speech recogn i t i o n system which employs information from a l l levels - from the aconstic to the semantic - to understand the meaning of interest. 1 ~ 1 it is true that the reseaches at the higher levels such as the syntactic and semantic levels have not been s u f f i c i e n t l y applied to speech recognition. however  the balance of each level of the system is important . the appli cat ion of the information at the higher levels might improve the t o t a l performance of the system but it should 
be noted that the communication system in which l i t t l e redundancy is remained is deprived of v a r i a b i l i t y and a d a p t a b i l i t y . though the information at the upper level may be used in the manner of human speech understanding  it does not mean that he cannot correctly recognize a single word which is pronounced c l e a r l y . therefore  the more e f f o r t 
should be necessary for the recognition of words or phonemes. if the speech understanding system is objected. in this study  f i r s t   a feature ext r a c t i o n method for the speech wave is treated as the most elemental problem. 
　　　recently  several authors have studied the estimation of the vocal t r a c t shape from the speech wave. but t i l l now the results are not necessar i l y s a t i s f a c t o r y   because  as is w e l l known  the spectral characteristics of the speech wave do not correspond one to one to the vocal t r a c t shape as an acoustic tube and because the speech wave carries the e f f e c t s of the vocal cord o s c i l l a t i o n   noise from the turbulence and so on. then it is desirable to apply the knowledge from physiological and phonological study for the estimation of the vocal tract shape. and such a reseach has p o t e n t i a l i t y to make possible the estimation of the motor commands that move the a r t i c u l a t o r y mechanism. it is doubtful t h a t   if the motor commands are precisely estimated  the phoneme recognition 
becomes easy. however  they may be good features for the speech r e c o g n i t i o n . in t h i s study  an a r t i c u l a t o r y model is constructed on the basis of x-ray data and a nonlinear regression method is used to estimate the a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters. the r e s u l t s of the estimation preserve the t y p i c a l nature of each phoneme and the method would p r o vide a useful feature e x t r a c t i o n technique. 
　　　second  the problem of sentence recognition is mathematically formulated as an optimization problem with the constraint of sentence s t r u c t u r e s and is solved by a method of dynamic programming. 
　　　here  it might be necessary to define what is recognition of sentence. the fundamental s i t u a t i o n of the speech is conversation. in the conversation between a and b  the representation   b understands the sentence spoken by a   has too much content. then we consider o n l y     b r e sponds to the sentence spoken by a.  the response is described by a state t r a n s i t i o n of the machine. of course  the machine may e x h i b i t some outputs at the t r a n s i t i o n . 
　　　each moment of the conversation is accompanied by a scene and usually the speaker and the receiver have a common recognition of the scene. the concept of the scene is n a t u r a l l y taken into account by the state of the machine. probable sentences that may appear under a state are l i m i t ed an ' the e f f e c t i v e number of the sentences that affects the recognition score is reduced. 
　　　in a p r a c t i c a l a p p l i c a t i o n   the purpose and the a b i l i t y of the machine is always l i m i t e d   and the contents of the conversation may be f i n i t e . then  it is allowable to set sentence structures to order words in r e s t r i c t e d ways. 
　　　in the framework mentioned above  the sentence recognition can be considered on the extension of a c l a s s i f i c a t i o n problem and an e f f e c t i v e optimal algorithm for the sentence recognition can be obtained.

construction of a r t i c u l a t o r y model 
　　　an a r t i c u l a t o r y model presents an e f f e c t i v e representation for the structures of the a r t i c u l a t o r y mechanism and the dynamical c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the a r t i c u l a t o r y motion  and further it r e l a t e s the a r t i c u a t o r y parameters to the acoustic ones  1 
1 　　　the c o n f i g u l a t i o n of the a r t i c u l a t o r y model is shown in f i g . l . the mldsaggital vocal t r a c t o u t l i n e can be represented by the variables specifying the positions of the movable s t r u c t u r e s   i . e . jaw  tongue and l i p s . the m a x i l l a   rearpharyngeal w a l l and larynx o u t l i n e s are fixed and approximated by the sequence of c i r c u l a r arcs and s t r a i g h t l i n e s . the jaw is assumed to rotate with the fixed radius about the fixed point f j   and i t s location 1s given by the angle with respect to the reference l i n e which is tangent to the hard p a l a t e . the jaw movement executes the passive e f f e c t to the p o s i t i o n of 
the 	tongue and l i p s   and influences not only rua 
mouth opening area but the o v e r a l l vocal 	t r a c t shape. 
       the l i p shape is s p e c i f i e d by the height l n and the protrusion lp r e l a t i v e to the jaw p o s i t i o n on the midsagittal plane. only the l i p protrusion parameter may be necessary to specify the l i p movement for the vowels  but both are required to explain the d i f f e r e n t gestures in the usual speech containing l a b i a l consonants. 
　　　the tongue contour is described in terms of a semi-polar coordinate system defined w i t h r e f erence to the jaw p o s i t i o n . the center f t rotates synchronously with the jaw movement1 therefore  the tongue contour is measured with the jaw based coordinate system. though the tongue may be able to form various shape  it has l i m i t e d freedom to move about in a r t i c u l a t o r y process on account of the p h y s i o l o g i c a l and phonological c o n s t r a i n t s . thdse constraints can be expressed by the strong c o r r e l a t i o n of the position of each segment along the tongue contour and may be extracted from the s t a t i s t i c a l analysis of the x-ray data. 
　　　it 	ia known that for the tongue a r t i c u l a t i o n of vowels  	the e x t r i n s i c muscle a c t i v i t y is more s i g n i f i c a n t than that of the i n t r i n s i c one. 	then  the p r i n c i p a l components for the e x t r i n s i c a c t v i t y 
are obtained from the tongue contour data for vowels  and the tongue contour vector for vowels xv can be expressed in the l i n e a r form as  
 1  
are eigenvectors and  is 
a mean vector for vowels which corresponds to the neutral tongue contour. the eigenvectors are calculated from the next equation.

　　　the f i r s t component represents the movement of the tongue body between the rear-pharyngeal wall and the hard palate d i r e c t i o n and produces mainly an antisymmetric perturbation of the vocal t r a c t . it indicates the opposite feature of back and f r o n t vowels  i . e .  a  vs   i   . the second component represents the movemerat of the tongue towards the velum and produces a symmetric perturbat i o n that is e f f e c t i v e for the rounded vowel   u   . the t h i r d component is less c l e a r l y explained and may be i n t e r p r e t e d as the r e s u l t i n g tongue deformation from the contraction of the posterior f i b e r s of genioglosus and the i n t r i n s i c muscle of the tongue t i p . the fourth component is an i n t r i n s i c component and represents the tongue t i p r e t r o f l e x . 
　　　as an example the l o c i of the tongue movement on ai~a1 space for three utterances /h1tv/ 
 v: a   i   u   are i l l u s t r a t e d in f i g . 1 . the points a on the l o c i indicate the onset and the o f f s e t of the tongue t i p closure. 
　　　from the above discussions  	it is seen that the following a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters are enough to describe the m i d s a g l t t a l vocal t r a c t o u t l i n e   

and a is the corresponding eigenvalue to s a t i s f y the c h a r a c t e r i s t i c equation.

　　　for the consonants  the e f f e c t of the i n t r i n sic muscle a c t i v i t y appears p a r t i c u l a r l y in the front part of the tongue but it is d i f f i c u l t to separate precisely the i n t r i n s i c muscle a c t i v i t y from the e x t r i n s i c one. at f i r s t the c o n t r i b u t i o n 
which comes from the e x t r i n s i c components are subtracted by p r o j e c t i n g the tongue contour vector xc to the vowel space which is spanned by the eigenvectors for the vowels. and the remainder is calculated as

. . .   q   is calculated in the same manner as f i n a l l y the expression f o r the consonants can be obtained as  
i . e . the jaw angle  the l i p protrusion l p and the weighting c o e f f i c i e n t s of the tongue compo-
nents a j   bfc. for the vowels the l i p height is dependent on the l i p protrusion and can be approximated by  
	lh - 1 - 1 l p -1 . 	 1  
the r e l a t i o n  1  was determined from the analysis of the front and side photographs. 
　　　the cross-sectional dimension along the vocal t r a c t is determined from a semi-polar coordinate 
system fixed with regard to the m a x i l l a and the rear-pharyngeal w a l l . the r e l a t i o n between the cross dimension d and the cross s e c t i o n a l area s is approximated by power function s-1 fi. in the l a b i a l region the area is approximated by an 
e l l i p s e w i t h the width given by 

where l s is the v e r t i c a l separation of the l i p s . 
　　　the vocal t r a c t is devided into 1 uniform c y l i n d r i c a l tubes and the r e f l e c t i o n c o e f f i c i e n t s between the adjoining sections are c a l c u l a t e d . regarding the losses at the g l o t t i s   l i p s and w i t h i n the t r a c t   a transmission-line model is constructed and the transfer function is expressed using z-transform.

where z-exp   the length of one section and c is the v e l o c i t y of sound. the formant frequencies are calculated from eq. 1  by the fibonacci searching method. 
estimation of a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters 
       it is w e l l known that the vocal t r a c t shape is not uniquely determined from the spectral c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the speech wave without the a d d i t i o n a l constraints in terms of the speech production process. such constraints must be considered from the p h y s i o l o g i c a l   phonological and personality points of view. the constraints can be r e f l e c t e d on the a r t i c u l a t o r y model in two ways one is in the physical dimension of the a r t i c u latory organs and in the components vectors vi and ok the other is the maimer of the control of the a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters. the l a t t e r is considered in this study only a l i t t l e . it is clear that the number of the a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters is much smaller than that of the c y l i n d r i c a l tubes to describe the vocal t r a c t shape and t h i s fact w i l l make the estimation easy. therefore  the vocal tract shape is determined by estimating these a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters. the present model is useful for the estimation from the speech wave  because it is constructed not only to describe the a r t i c u l a t o r y state s t r i c t l y but also to be d i r e c t l y related to the v a r i a t i o n of the vocal tract shape. however  there remains a p o s s i b i l i t y to bring about a freedom in the a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters f o r a certain region of the spectral c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of a speech sound. therefore  it is desirable to apply the cooperative r e l a t i o n between the a r t i c u l a t o r s in s t a t i c and dynamic senses to avoid such a freedom. 
　　　the time constants of the a r t i c u l a t o r y motion are large compared w i t h the sound propagation phenomena and in the case of the a r t i c u l a t i o n of vowels  the power spectral density of the speech sound is considered to be stationary in a smal1 inlerval. therefore  the s t a t i c correspondence between the a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters and the acoust i c ones is very important. 
　　　the relationship between the a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters and the acoustic features is formulated in nonlinear regression as  


where cy and c are the covariance matrices and  means the estimated value of 
　　　four variables are used as the a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters  namely the jaw opening 	the 
weighting c o e f f i c i e n t s of the p r i n c i p a l components of the tongue contour a1 and a1  and the l i p protrusion l p   which were introduced in the preceding section. as the acoustic features  f i r s t two formant frequencies f1 and f1 are used  
because they are the most s i g n i f i c a n t features to be closely related to the vocal t r a c t shape for the vowel-like sounds. the data from which the regression c o e f f i c i e n t s are determined consist 
of the samples d i s t r i b u t e d around the five japanese vowels and real ones obtained from the x-ray p i c t u r e s   and the t o t a l number of the samples is 1. by u t i l i z i n g the real a r t i c u l a t o r y data for the estimation  some cooperative r e l a t i o n between the a r t i c u l a t o r s is included in the regression c o e f f i c i e n t s . the formant frequencies are c a l culated according to the algorithm presented in the preceding section. 
　　　the estimated result for the synthesized continuous speech / a i u e o / is shown in f i g . 1 in comparison with the o r i g i n a l a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters. solid lines show the o r i g i n a l a r t i c u l a t o r y mot ion. the f i r s t and the second formant frequencies at every moment are calculated for t h i s a r t i c u l a t o r y movement and conversely the a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters are estimated by e q .   l l   for those formant frequencies. the estimated values agree with the o r i g i n a l ones except for the s l i g h t deviation in the tongue parameters a  and .it  however  t h i s result means that if the model is just f i t t e d for the speaker  the estimation 
would be successful by the nonlinear regression method. 
　　　the result for the real speech data /a i u e 1/ is shown in fig.1. the speaker is d i f f e r e n t from the person whose data were used to construct the model. although the estimated values cannot be compared with the true ones because the x-ray data were not taken f o r this utterance  they convey the t y p i c a l nature of each vowel. for example  vowel  is characterized by the most p o s i t i v e value of a1 and the l i p protrusion and c l e a r l y distinguished from  o  by the d i f f e r e n c e s of the jaw opening and the tongue parameter a*. front vowel   i   is characterized by the most negat i v e value of a 1 and distinguished from  e  by the difference of the degree of the jaw opening. 
     in fig.1 and f i g . 1   the marks which indicate the estimated values of the fonnant frequencies 
mean the calculated formant values corresponding to the estimated a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters. it is seen that the correspondence in the fonnant domain is very w e l l . nevertheless  there are s l i g h t deviation in the a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters in f i g . 1 . this indicates that the f i r s t two fonnant f r e quencies are not s u f f i c i e n t to decide precisely the a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters in some region. 
　　　in a p r a c t i c a l point of view  the outputs of f i l t e r bank is more convenient than the fonnant frequencies as a set of acoustic parameters  
because the c a l c u l a t i o n of the formant frequencies is not so easy matter. then the estimation using the output of the f i l t e r bank was t r i e d . the o u t -

put s i g n a l s of the f i l t e r b a n k were reduced to 1 or 1 components by the p r i n c i p a l components a n a l y s i s and those main components were used as the acousticparameters in the n o n l i n e a r r e g r e s s i o n . 'the r e s u l t is shown in f i g . 1 f o r the s y n t h e s i z e d voice /a i u e o / . compared w i t h f i g   1   the accuracy is almost the same. the o r i g i n a l and the e s t i m a t e d s p e c t r a l p a t t e r n s are shown i n f i g . 1 . formant f r e q u e n c i e s from f i r s t t o f o u r t h are i n good a g r e e ment. 
       it may be concluded t h a t the a r t i c u l a t o r y parameters e s t i m a t e d by the n o n l i n e a r r e g r e s s i o n method can be employed as a f e a t u r e v e c t o r f o r the

　　　an important problem arises in the above formulation. that is the aberration of the scene recognition between the speaker and the machine. the speaker does not know the state of the machine or the speaker u t t e r s a sentence by mistake that should not be permitted in that s i t u a t i o n . these phenomena often occur in the actual conversation. p a r t i c u l a r l y in the case that the machine made a misrecognltion and went to a state unexpected by the speaker  it is d i f f i c u l t for the speaker to do a suitable a c t i o n . in such aberration condition the above algorithm cannot work s a t i s f a c t o r i l y . this phenomenon always appear when the r e l a t i o n between the speaker and the receiver is made t i g h t 
to improve the recognition score. 
conclusion 
　　　in t h i s study two important parts of the speech understanding system were considered. the feature e x t r a c t i o n method that u t i l i z e s the phys i o l o g i c a l and the phonological c o n s t r a i n t s was proposed. it w i l l be e f f e c t i v e for the speech recogni tion by improving the word or phoneme r e cognition score. 
　　　recently  several attempts have been made to estimate the cross-sectional area function of the vocal t r a c t using the state space expression of the acoustic vave in the vocal t r a c t . however  in those framework  it w i l l make the problem too 
much complicated one to consider the various cons t r a i n t s of the a r t l c u l a t o r y motion. if the dynamics is taken i n t o account in any sense  the dynamic character of the a r t l c u l a t o r y motion should be considered f i r s t and the state space expression of the acoustic level may be ignored because of the difference in t h e i r time constants. 
　　　the sentence recognition algorithm is w e l l formulated and very compact. 	then  it makes easy the r e a l time operation of the speech understanding without using special hard wares. 
　　　the two methods were discussed separately in t h i s paper. 	but  	if 	the s u i t a b l e algorithm to decide phonemes from the extracted feature is added  the system w i l l be completed.
