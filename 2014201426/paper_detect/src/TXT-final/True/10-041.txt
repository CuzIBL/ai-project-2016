     temporal and s p a t i a l references have been treated as unrelated issues in semantic represent a t i o n . what must be represented are the s p a t i a l and temporal s i t u a t i o n s to which the speaker a l l u d e s . for example  w i t h  john threw a b a l l through a window   it must be shown that the event occurred some time in the past and that the b a l l followed a t r a j e c t o r y that took it through a 
window. many theories that mention one t o p i c discuss the o t h e r   but only s e p a r a t e l y   e . g .   f i l l m o r e  1   schank  1   and schubert  1 . 
     this paper proposes a simultaneous r e s o l u t i o n of an important part of both problems. it is proposed that s p a t i a l and temporal references be shown as p r e d i c a t i n g a s i n g l e type of e n t i t y showing the spatiotemporal l o c a t i o n s of the events or states of a f f a i r s to which the speaker r e f e r s . these e n t i t i e s are c a l l e d  space/time zones . we present t h i s analysis in a. semantic net formalism resembling those of brachman  1  and schubert  1 . 
     the proposal w i l l be sketched out in the remainder of the paper. 	f i r s t temporal  	then spa-

temporal reference 
     our proposal is to show temporal references p r e d i c a t i n g the times in which events occured or states of a f f a i r s h e l d . in doing t h i s   we f o l l o w a t r a d i t i o n in semantics  exemplified r e c e n t l y by schubert  1 . in a semantic n e t   what is shown is a node representing a temporal e n t i t y   or time  being l i n k e d to a node representing an event or s t a t e . the temporal reference is then r e p sented by r e l a t i n g t h i s time to o t h e r s . one of the many arguments for t h i s analysis is the s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d connection between syntax and semantics. s y n t a c t i c a l l y   temporal references generally i n v o l v e the verb. since verbs also i d e n t i f y the type of event or s t a t e we r e f l e c t that here. s i m i l a r l y   when temporal reference is associated w i t h nouns they are v e r b a l and event nouns  as in   t h e swimming t h i s a f t e r n o o n   and  the game at t h r e e   . some c o n s t r u c t i o n s do not show t h i s simple r e l a t i o n s h i p between verb and event. in  john mailed the package to mary t h i s a f t e r n o o n .     the time of the m a i l i n g was t h i s afternoon but the time when the package is to get to mary is not i d e n t i f i e d by t h i s a f t e r n o o n . these c o n s t r u c t i o n s do  however  f i t i n n a t u r a l l y w i t h analyses where s i n g l e clauses are shown by several events or s t a t e s   such as in schank  1$. here temporal references can be associated w i t h the time of some or a l l of the events or states i n v o l v e d . 
       i n t u i t i o n s based on phrases such as  the boy in the c a r   do not lead to an event-and-state a n a l y s i s . schubert  1   for example  shows s p a t i a l references applying t o p a r t i c i p a n t s i n events. however  there are phrases such as   k i s s ing in the park  and the word  where   as in  where is the game being played  . these can e a s i l y be seen as l o c a t i n g events. this s e c t i o n sketches an a n a l y s i s based on such i n s i g h t s . a more complete p r e s e n t a t i o n of the work is found in sondheimer  1 . 
       the semantic-net a n a l y s i s of space p a r a l l e l s in i t s simplest form the proposed a n a l y s i s of time. event or s t a t e nodes are l i n k e d to a spat i a l r e f e r e n c e   as in figure i. the event type is   s l e e p i n g     the p h y s i c a l objects are shown in o v a l s   and the space through a square. the spat i a l reference is shown through a p r e p o s i t i o n based concept    i n     which references the space through i t s f-arc  f o r   f i g u r e     and the r e l a t e d object through i t s g-arc  f o r  ground . the tarc and time in the example f o l l o w s the e a r l i e r d e s c r i p t i o n . 
       this type of a n a l y s i s allows d i r e c t l y f o r the examples that lead to i t   but it is also proposed for the apparent counterexamples. in these examp l e s   an a b s t r a c t s t a t e of a f f a i r s    being-at   is used to show the existence of objects in space and time. therefore  the boy in the car  assuming p a s t     and also  the boy was in the c a r .     would be shown as in figure i except w i t h being-at r e p l a c i n g sleeping. note t h a t on t h i s p o i n t our analyses are isomorphic to those of schubert  1 . 
       the above does not allow f o r one important connection between event or state l o c a t i o n s and object l o c a t i o n . for example from  the boy s l e p t in the c a r .     t h a t the boy was in the car is e v i dent. to f i t t h i s in w i t h our a n a l y s i s   we p r o pose the use of i n f e r e n c e . as is usual w i t h semantic n e t s   what we have been using is an a b b r e v i a t i o n of a complete n o t a t i o n . importantly the d i s t i n c t i o n between concepts and instances  
or types and tokens  is missing here  see brachman  1 . our examples only show instances. with the complete system  a conceptual l e v e l is a v a i l a b l e t o supply i n t e r p r e t a t i v e s t r u c t u r e i n c l u d i n g appropriate inference r u l e s . what we propose is that these inference r u l e s supply the connection between event and s t a t e l o c a t i o n and object l o c a t i o n . for example it would be approp r i a t e to use a r u l e l i k e   i f something is sleeping some place then i n f e r that t h a t t h i n g is at that p l a c e   . 
knowledge 	r e p r . - 1 : 	sonhh* m  r 1        another aspect of the s p a t i a l reference problem is that l i k e temporal reference a m u l t i p l e event-and-state a n a l y s i s is sometimes c a l l e d f o r . for example in  he held her on h i s lap in the t u n n e l .     only she must be shown on his lap w i t h both of them in the t u n n e l . a t y p i c a l m u l t i p l e event-and-state r e p r e s e n t a t i o n would allow for t h i s by having one e n t i t y showing him holding her causing another e n t i t y to be true namely that she remained somewhere. the  one h i s l a p   can predicate t h i s l a s t s t a t e . the   i n the t u n n e l   can apply to the highest form  w i t h inference 
rules associating the predication with the participants. 
     sentences about motion are among those that require multiple-event-and-state analysis. however the predication of the location of motion presents new d i f f i c u l t i e s . it is possible to predicate points in motion  as in  he walked into the house. . it is also possible to predicate segments of motion  as in  he walked across the lawn   the sense of  across  here parrellellng that in  the path across the lawn is made of bark. . further in motional events  multiple predications can show ordering as in  he walked across the lawn up the stairs into the house. . to allow for these phenomena our proposal takes the location of the movement as a history of the moving objects and uses two functions to produce from that history segments of the journey. figure ii gives an example. the function  segment  has the movement as its parameter  p-arc  and a segment  shown by   q     as i t s value  v-arc. these segments are predicated by spatial references. the function  unit  produces another type of segment  shown by    t   . when a  is predicated the assertion is that the relation held at the end but not before. the segments themselves are compared by relinks to show ordering. 
     this is the gist of our spatial reference proposal. but as w i l l be seen there are problems. 
relating spatial and temporal reference 
     at this point two separate analyses have been related to events and states of affairs. 	it is claimed that they can and should be combined into one. 	there are good reasons to do this 
conjoining. these can begin to be seen through a problem with figure ii in interpreting the lessthan comparisons. these must have a scale for comparison. however being between segments of a journey  the only spatial scale available is the ad hoc one based on the journey i t s e l f . the way out of the dilemma is to associate the time of the journey with the segments and to compare these times. the location of the motion can be thought of as existing in four-dimensional space  we can call it a  space/time zone   following a suggestion of lemmon  1 . the unit and segment function can produce parts of zones on the basis of parameters showing final time and i n t i a l and final time  respectively. the times appearing there can then be used for ordering. but now that time is a part of motion  at least here a separate temporal entity is redundant. 
     this is only half the battle. what of nonmotional events and states of affairs  apparently a space/time zone analysis is not out of order. first  in apparently a l l durational events and states  it is possible to make motional references. so with  he sat on the books from new york to boston.   the motional problems reappear. second  times must be found in order to locate objects used in ground roles in spatial references  e.g.  the car in figure i. tf the entity in the figure role is a space/time zone  then the appropriate time is immediately available. 
     from this we conclude that space/time zones can be and should be used for both spatial and temporal reference. we propose a style of analysis exemplified by figure i i i . there would be a space/time-arc identifying a zone    gj  . this zone could then be predicated by both spatial and temporal references. hence we have what we set out to find a simultaneous analysis of spatial and temporal reference.
