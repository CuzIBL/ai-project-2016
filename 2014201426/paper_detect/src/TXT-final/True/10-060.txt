introduction 
       s p e c i f i c a t i o n overlays are a technique f o r r e p r e s e n t i n g knowledge h i e r a r c h i c a l l y   where the  nodes  are s t r u c t u r e d concepts. the scheme is described in terms of p a r t i t i o n e d semantic nets suggested by hendrix   1   . the idea of m u l t i p l e i n t e r p r e t i v e contexts is also found in a very general form in several a . i . languages  see bobrow and raphael   1     . 
specification .overlays 
       knowledge is organized in a number of shallow h i e r a r c h i e s   each representing a complex concept. the root of each of these trees is a kernel concept and each lower node designates some s p e c i f i c a t i o n to a more p a r t i c u l a r concept. the k e r n e l concept represents the canonical or fundamental form of the concept. a s p e c i f i c a t i o n can be v i s u a l i z e d as the a p p l i c a t i o n of an overlay to the k e r n e l   which adds and modifies i n f o r m a t i o n   with the r e s u l t seen as a s i n g l e   u n i f i e d concept. a reference to  or i n t o   a concept is made to the k e r n e l   w i t h an e x p l i c i t i n d i c a t i o n of the appropriate sequence of s p e c i f i c a t i o n s . for example  an instance of shoot would be a simple tok arc to shoot. but an instance of shoot-old-cannon would be represented by a tok /  shoot-old-cannon  shoot-cannon  shoot-with-gunpowder  arc to shoot. the convention followed i s t h a t the s p e c i f i c a t i o n path  from most s p e c i f i c to l e a s t s p e c i f i c   is given f o l l o w i n g the slash of the tok arc p o i n t i n g to the kernel concept. 
an implementation 
       a simple  e f f i c i e n t implementation has been based on grunt1  smith and young   1       a set of lisp functions which provide e f f i c i e n t r e p r e s e n t a t i o n and manipulation of p a r t i t i o n e d semantic nets. a p a r t i t i o n in grunt1 is c a l l e d an a r c s e t r and each arc in the net is in one or more a r c s e t s . a l l accessing functions are s e n s i t i v e to the l i s t o f c u r r e n t l y a c t i v e a r c s e t s   which i s c a l l e d the c o n t e x t . from a given node  the only arcs accessible are those in some arcset in the c u r r e n t context. a l l computed l i s t s o f arcs o r nodes are ordered according to the c o n t e x t . 
       a kernel concept is represented e s s e n t i a l l y as a single   d e f a u l t   a r c s e t . each s p e c i f i c a t i o n of the kernel concept is defined by a separate s p e c i f i c a t i o n arcsqt which contains the r e l e v a n t m o d i f i c a t i o n s . the simplest method of e f f e c t i n g a 
m o d i f i c a t i o n is through the use of a replacement arc in a  more v i s i b l e    nearer the f r o n t of the context  a r c s e t . for example  the instrument of shoot has a tok arc to machine  but the shoot-with-gunpowder arcset has a tok arc to gun. for an instance of a concept  the s p e c i f i c a t i o n path arcsets and the kernel arcset form the context used in accessing t h a t concept. thus  if shoot-with-gunpowder is referenced  the tok arc to gun is v i s i b l e   and being  more v i s i b l e     is used. m o d i f i c a t i o n of the kernel concept can also be achieved in a number of other ways  such as and  or and not arcs in s p e c i f i c a t i o n a r c s e t s . 
advantages 
       one advantage of the described technique is the a b i l i t y to t r e a t a p a r t i c u l a r concept as a s i n g l e   u n i f i e d concept. this e l i m i n a t e s the e x p l i c i t t r a v e r s i n g of sup arcs w i t h i n an a l g o r i t h m . i n s t e a d   the a l g o r i t h m i s expressed i n terms of an e x p l o r a t i o n of the complete concept. controlled a c c e s s i b i l i t y accomplishes t h i s w i t h o u t c o n s t r u c t i o n of the concept whenever a reference is made. this composite already e x i s t s in the r e p r e s e n t a t i o n . a second advantage afforded by s p e c i f i c a t i o n overlays is a c l e a r d e l i n e a t i o n of the c e n t r a l meaning of concepts  s i m i l a r to the use of semantic p r i m i t i v e s . the notion underlying the use of k e r n e l concepts is that each complex concept may be t r e a t e d as a   r e l a t i v e   p r i m i t i v e   w i t h a v a r i e t y of possible e l a b o r a t i o n s . a t h i r d advantage is the s i m p l i c i t y w i t h which c e r t a i n p a t t e r n matching may be performed. any p a t t e r n r e q u i r i n g a concept k w i t h s p e c i f i c a t i o n path  x  w i l l be matched by any concept k w i t h s p e c i f i c a t i o n path  yx   and t h i s is immediately recognizable because of the reference r e p r e s e n t a t i o n . the usefulness of such matching is due to the use of the kernel concept to capture the c e n t r a l meaning of concept. a f i n a l advantage is that it is possible to simply describe some aspects of f o r g e t t i n g . g e n e r a l i z a t i o n and loss of s p e c i f i c d e t a i l in the r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of an instance of some p a r t i c u l a r concept is modelled by dropping s p e c i f i c a t i o n s from the s p e c i f i c a t i o n p a t h . for example  a p a r t i c u l a r t r a i n t r i p would be represented as an instance of go w i t h s p e c i f i c a t i o n path  rail  land-trayel . dropping rail would r e s u l t in the r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of a land t r i p   and a d d i t i o n a l l y dropping land-travel would leave a t o t a l l y unspecified go. further g e n e r a l i z a t i o n would be impossible. 
generalization also creates the p o s s i b i l i t y of sub-events becoming i n a c c e s s i b l e   which would seem to be the type of loss that should occur in f o r g e t t i n g by g e n e r a l i z a t i o n . 
       current i n v e s t i g a t i o n s i n t e x t r e p r e s e n t a t i o n using s p e c i f i c a t i o n overlays should t e s t and demonstrate these c a p a b i l i t i e s .
