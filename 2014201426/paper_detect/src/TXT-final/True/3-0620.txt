
analogy is a powerful boundary-transcending process that exploits a conceptual system's ability to perform controlled generalization in one domain and re-specialization into another. the result of this semantic leap is the transference of meaning from one concept to another from which metaphor derives its name  literally: to carry over . such generalization and re-specialization can be achieved using a variety of representations and techniques  most notably abstraction via a taxonomic backbone  or selective projection via structure-mapping on propositional content. in this paper we explore the extent to which a bilingual lexical ontology for english and chinese  called hownet  can support both approaches to analogy.
1	introduction
theories of analogy and metaphor are typically based either on structure-mapping  e.g.   falkenhainer et al.1; veale and keane  1   or on abstraction e.g.   hutton  1; fass  1; way  1; veale  1 . while the former is most associated with analogy  the latter has been a near-constant in the computational treatment of metaphor. structure-mapping assumes that the causal behaviour of a concept is expressed in an explicit  graph-theoretic form so that unifying sub-graph isomorphisms can be found between different propositional representations. in contrast  abstraction theories assume that analogous concepts  even if far removed in ontological terms  will nonetheless share a common hypernym that will capture their causal similarity. thus  we should expect an analogous pairing like cancer and assassin to have very different immediate hypernyms but to ultimately share a behavioural abstraction like kill-agent  e.g.  see  veale  1  .
　with a well known lexical ontology like wordnet  see  miller  1    both structure-mapping and taxonomic approaches are problematic. the idea that a one-size-fits-all representation like wordnet will actually provide a hypernym like kill-agent seems convenient almost to the point of incredulity. as much as we want our ontologies to an-

 
the generous support of enterprise ireland is acknowledged.ticipate future analogies with these pro-active categorizations  most off-the-shelf ontologies simply do not possess such convenient terms  see  wong  1 . similarly  wordnet lacks the propositional content that is the necessary grist for a structure-mapping approach. the semantic content that would ideally fill this role is not explicit  but implicitly resides in the unstructured textual glosses that annotate each lexical concept. 
　in this paper we explore whether another lexical ontology  the chinese/english hownet system  see  dong  1; carpuat et al. 1; wong  1    is better suited to the demands of analogy generation. hownet combines a taxonomic backbone with an explicit  if somewhat sparse and under-specified  propositional semantics. this combination allows us to evaluate the extent to which both structure-mapping and abstraction theories of analogy can be supported by the same lexical ontology.
1	past work
that analogy and metaphor operate across multiple levels of conceptual abstraction has been well known since classical times. aristotle first provided a compelling taxonomic account of both in his poetics  see  hutton  1  for a translation   and computationalists have been fascinated by this perspective ever since. while the core idea has survived relatively unchanged  one must discriminate theories that apparently presume a static type-hierarchy to be sufficient for all abstraction purposes  e.g.   fass  1    from theories that posit the need for a dynamic type hierarchy  e.g.   way  1; veale  1  . one must also differentiate theories that have actually been implemented  e.g.   fass  1; veale  1   from those that are either notional or that seem to court computational intractability  e.g.   hutton  1; way  1  . perhaps most meaningfully  one must differentiate theories and implementations that assume hand-crafted  purpose-built ontologies  e.g.   fass  1   from those that exploit an existing large-scale resource like wordnet  e.g.   veale  1  . the latter approach side-steps any possible charge of hand-crafting by working only with third-party resources  but at the cost of living with their perceived flaws and inadequacies. 
structure-mapping theory is founded on the premise that 
the most satisfying analogies are those that operate at the causal level of representation  since causality allows an analogy to offer a deep explanation for a poorly understood phenomenon  e.g.  see  falkenhainer et al. 1   thus  the atom as miniature solar-system is a satisfying analogy because both source and target are causally structured around the notion of rotation. furthermore  when comparing agents or artefacts  e.g.  see  veale and keane  1    this causality can be captured by considering the functional or behavioural commonality between target and source: a footballer can be meaningfully described as a gladiator or a warrior since each exhibits competitive behaviour  and a scalpel can be compared to a sabre  a sword or a cleaver since each has a cutting behaviour.
　by employing a single lexical resource  hownet  to implement both the taxonomic abstraction and the structure-mapping theories of analogy  we have as a secondary goal a demonstration that both perspectives are not fundamentally opposed. structure-mapping can be seen as a form of structural-abstraction  where one abstracts out the causal backbone of a concept  while taxonomic abstraction  if derived from the relational structure of a concept  can also be seen as a highly selective form of structure-mapping.
1	comparing wordnet and hownet
hownet and wordnet each reflect a different view of semantic organization. wordnet is differential in nature: rather than attempting to express the meaning of a word explicitly  wordnet instead differentiates words with different meanings by placing them in different synonym sets  and further differentiates these synsets from one another by assigning them to different positions in its taxonomy. in contrast  hownet is constructive in nature. it does not provide a human-oriented textual gloss for each lexical concept  but instead combines sememes from a less discriminating taxonomy to compose a semantic representation of meaning for each word sense.
　for example  the lexical concept surgeon|医生 is given the following semantic definition in hownet:
surgeon|医生 {human|人:hostof={occupation|职位}  
         domain={medical|医}}  {doctor|医治:agent={~}}}
which can be glossed thus:  a surgeon is a human with an occupation in the medical domain who acts as the agent of a doctoring activity.  the {~} construct serves as a self-reference  to mark the location of the concept being defined in the given semantic structure. the oblique reference offered by the tilde serves to make the definition more generic  so that many different concepts can conceivably employ the same definition. thus  hownet uses the above definition not only for surgeon  but for medical workers in general  from orderlies to nurses  internists and neurologists.
　perhaps because hownet relies less on hierarchical differentiation  it has a considerably less developed middle ontology than wordnet. for instance  most kinds of person in hownet  from mathematicians to hobos  are placed directly under the hypernym human|人  eschewing the intermediate concepts like {professional}  {specialist} and {worker} that give substance to wordnet's middle ontology. we note that hownet does indeed define these concepts - but unlike wordnet  it does so at the leaf level where they add nothing to the internal structure of the taxonomy.
1	analogy via relational signatures
the skeletal nature of hownet semantic definitions  combined with the wide-spread use of {~} as a generic reference  suggests how hownet might support an efficient approach to analogical recall. by indexing each concept on a reduced form of its semantic definition - a relational signature - analogies will correspond to collisions between concepts with different definitions but with identical signatures. such an approach can be efficiently implemented using simple string hashing of signatures  to detect analogical collisions between kitchens and factories  generals and admirals  ballet dancers and acrobats  or cruise missiles and arrows. the devil here is in the lack of detail: because hownet's definitions are frequently imprecise and fail to fully specify a concept  they allows others - potential analogues - to occupy the same reduced semantic space. the further we exacerbate this deficiency  indexing each definition on an increasingly diluted version of itself  the more distant and creative will be the analogies that are generated. for example  excluding the hypernym of a definition  or its domain markings  facilitates analogies between people and non-people  such as pests and persecutors  or hackers and viruses.
　to implement both the abstraction and structure-mapping theories of analogy  we will explore the effectiveness of two kinds of relational signatures in the current work: atomic signatures based on taxonomic abstraction  and more template-like signatures based on generalized propositional content in which place-holder variables have been added. 
1	taxonomic abstraction with hownet 
given the general impoverishment of hownet's middle ontology  at least compared with that of wordnet   abstraction-based signatures should not be based directly on taxonomic organization. rather  by instead deriving taxonomic signatures from the relational structure of a concept's semantic definition  we can better capture the functional and behavioral nature of the concepts concerned. we can do this by focusing on that part of each definition that contains an explicit self-reference in the form {~}. for instance  consider the following semantic definition of repairman|修理工:
{human|人:hostof={occupation|职位}  
{repair|修理:agent={~}}}
noting the relational position of {~}  we can infer that a repairman is the agent of a repairing activity. expressing this as a taxonomic abstraction  we can reify the combination of activity and role to create a new taxonomic term repair-agent  of which repairman will be an instance. from an analogical perspective  repair-agent thus serves as a good relational signature for repairman|修理. 
　further noting that the hownet taxonomy defines the predicate repair|修理as a specialization of the reinstatement predicate resume|恢复  we can further establish repair-agent as a specialization of resume-agent. this double layer of abstraction effectively establishes a new  parallel taxonomy that organizes lexical-concepts according to their analogical potential  rather than their formal taxonomic properties. as shown in figure 1 then  resume-agent will encompass not only repair-agent  but doctor-agent  since hownet defines the predicate doctor|医治as a specialization of resume|恢复.

figure 1: portion of a new three-level abstraction hierarchy derived from hownet's relational structures.
in general  taxonomic signatures are generated as follows: given a semantic fragment f:role={~} in a hownet definition of a concept c  we create the signatures f-role and f'-role  where f' is the immediate hownet hypernym of f  which in turn is the immediate hypernym of c. the role in question might be agent  patient  instrument  or any other role supported by hownet  such as target  content  etc.

figure 1: a hierarchy of taxonomic signatures that facilitates analogy between instruments that  alter the form  of others.
each concept is thus assigned two different taxonomic signatures: a direct signature  f-role  based on the specific relational structure of the concept  and another more general signature  f'-role  that is abstracted from this direct signature. these signatures effectively form an alternate taxonomy by which the lexical concepts in hownet can be organized for analogical purposes. figure 1 above illustrates a partial hierarchy derived from the hownet semantics of various form-altering tools.
　this additional layer of abstraction is necessary to facilitate creative analogy between semantically distant concepts. nonetheless  we note that since hownet's designers have already exercised a certain degree of metaphoric license  even concepts with the same direct signature can exhibit a surprising degree of semantic variety.

figure 1: diversity among concepts with the same signatures.
this diversity  as illustrated by figure 1  means that the analogy  death is an assassin  can be generated without recourse to a more abstract signature.
1	structure-mapping with hownet 
　the structure-mapping approach also strives for abstraction  not through the selective creation of new taxonyms but through a form of structural rarefaction. structure-mapping theory places particular emphasis on the causal backbone of a concept's propositional content  which is usually projected unchanged from one domain to another   falkenhainer et al. 1  . based on this isomorphic alignment of relational structures  the entities contained in each structure are typically placed into a 1-to-1 correspondence with one another. the attributive modifiers of these entities play a more peripheral role in structure-mapping  but in approaches like sapper  veale and keane  1  they often serve as a literal grounding for an analogy.
　the semantic definitions provided by hownet are already so skeletal and under-specified that we can operate on the assumption that they represent the relational backbone of a concept's meaning. so in generating a set of structure-mapping signatures for a given concept  we will assume that each signature preserves the general form of a single 
proposition. consider the hownet definition of blind person| 盲人:
{human|人:
{disable|知道:
ofpart={part|部件:partposition={eye|眼}  whole= {human|人}} 
experiencer={~}  scope={look|看}}}
in other words  a blind person has  a disability of the eye that affects one's ability to look . one finds precisely the same propositional structure in the hownet definition of lame person|拐子  except that eye|眼is replaced with leg|腿and look|看is replaced with walk|走. the goal of a structure-mapping approach is to capture this semantic isomorphism while identifying eye:leg and look:walk as cross-domain counterparts. one way to do this is to generalize from each definition a signature that  by virtue of identicality  signals a structural equivalence between individual definitions. for instance  the common structural signature for blind person|盲人 and lame person|拐子 might look like this:
{ :{ill|病态:ofpart={ } experiencer={~} scope={ }}}
generalized structural signatures like this can be generated using the following 1-step process:
1. split each definition into multiple propositions  and generate a separate signature for each.  
1. if a proposition describes a noun concept  replace its taxonomic head with a   marker. in contrast  if a proposition describes a verb concept  replace its taxonomic head with its most specific hypernym. 
1. replace the conceptual arguments bound to each case-role of a predicate with the variable marker { }. these markers will indicate positions in the signature where 1-to-1 correspondences between source and target structures can be made.
1. when a propositional sub-structure corresponds to the definition of another hownet concept  replace the entire sub-structure with a { } variable marker.
1. replace predicates by their immediate hypernyms in the hownet taxonomy. thus  both repair|修理in the definition of repairman|修理  and doctor|医治in the definition of surgeon|医生   should be replaced by the hypernym resume|恢复 when generating their respective signatures.
1. remove any explicit domain tag in a proposition from the corresponding signature  e.g.  the assignment domain={medical|医} in the definition of surgeon|医生 . this is necessary since analogy is meant to transcend domain boundaries.
1. generalize any attributive value to its immediate hypernym. as such  step 1 above should not variablize the arguments of the attributive relations modifier  manner  restrictive  host or content. 
following these 1 steps  the following structural signatures will be assigned to each of the concepts surgeon|医生  repairman|修理  reviser|修订者  watchmaker|钟表匠 and herbalist|药农:
{ :hostof={ }}
{ : resume|恢复:agent={~}}}
 note: because the hostof relation always occurs with the binding occupation|职位in hownet  only the latter signature is retained as an analogical index 
more structural richness is exhibited by the lexical concepts apostle|使徒and insider|局内人  whose hownet definitions are shown below.
apostle|使徒
 {human|人:
{believe|修理: agent={~}  content={humanized|拟人}  domain={religion|宗教}}}
person who knows inside story|个中人  {human|人:
{know|知道:
agent={~}  content={fact|事情:
modifier=covert|隐秘}}}
these are also assigned the same structural signature:
signature  { : {haveknowledge|有知:
agent={~}  content={ }}
the sub-structure {fact|事情:modifier=covert|隐秘} has been completely variablized within the signature of person who knows inside story|个中人since this corresponds to the hownet definition of secret|秘事 see step 1 . analogically then  an apostle is a religious insider who knows the inside scoop on a deity  denoted humanized|拟人in hownet .
1	comparative evaluation
consider first the composition of the hownet version used in this research. it contains 1 unique lexical concepts  excluding synonyms  and 1 unique semantic definitions. clearly then  these definitions are under-specified to the extent that many are shared by non-identical concepts  such as cart|板车and bicycle|单车  which hownet simply defines as manual vehicles . furthermore  1% of these definitions comprise a single proposition  while 1% comprise two propositions and only 1% comprise three or more.
　we evaluate the taxonomic and structure-mapping approaches using four criteria: coverage - the percentage of unique hownet definitions from which a valid signature can be derived; recall - the percentage of definitions for which at least one analogical counterpart can be found; parsimony/precision - the percentage of effective signatures that can actually be used to generate analogies  since a parsimonious approach will precisely generate just those signatures that are analogically useful ; and richness - the complexity of the mappings involved  as measured by the average number of entity correspondences per analogy. 
1	evaluating taxonomic abstraction 
1.1 	taxonomic coverage 
since taxonomic signatures exploit occurrences of {~} for their generation  both the coverage and recall of the taxonomic abstraction approach depend crucially on the wide-spread usage of this reflexive construct. 
　however  of the 1 unique definitions in hownet  just  1 employ this form of self-reference. the coverage offered by taxonomic signatures is therefore just 1% of the available definitions.
1.1 	taxonomic recall 
for these 1 self-referential definitions  1 unique direct signatures are generated. in turn  another 1 abstract signatures are derived from these via predicate generalization. in total  1 unique taxonomic signatures are generated  revealing that in 1% of cases  the abstract signature of one definition corresponds to the direct signature of another.
　a majority of these signatures  1%  serve to generate analogies for 1 semantic definitions. the overall recall rate then is 1%. the most productive taxonomic signature is control agent  which serves to analogically co-index 1 unique definitions.
1.1 	taxonomic parsimony/precision 
overall  1 of all 1 taxonomic signatures prove useful in co-indexing two or more definitions  while 1 taxonomic signatures are associated with just a single definition. the parsimony of the taxonomic approach is thus 1%.  
1.1 	taxonomic richness 
only one mapping  at the gross level of source and target concepts  can be generated by the taxonomic approach. for instance  the approach can recognize that  blind person|盲人 and lame person|拐子are analogous by virtue of sharing the taxonomic signature disable-experiencer. however  it cannot recursively determine the entity mappings eye:leg and look:walk. the taxonomic approach thus has a uniform mapping richness of 1.  
1	evaluating structure-mapping 
1.1 	structure-mapping coverage 
a structure-mapping signature can be generated for every semantic definition in hownet. in principle then  the coverage of this approach is 1%. in practice  however  1% of hownet's semantic definitions contain no real structure beyond the specification of a hypernym or a domain tag. the maximum coverage of structure-mapping then  as limited to definitions with relational structure  is 1%.
1.1 	structure-mapping recall 
hownet's 1 unique structured definitions comprise 1 unique propositions. from these  1 unique structural signatures are derived  many are generalizations of other signatures   serving to find analogues for 1 definitions. the recall for structure-mapping is thus 1%. the most productive structural signature is:
{component.部分:whole={ }}
which serves to analogically co-index 1 unique semantic definitions.
1.1 	structure-mapping parsimony/precision 
with 1% of all structural signatures serving to index just a single definition  the parsimony of the structure-mapping approach must be judged as a low 1%.    
1.1 	structure-mapping richness 
most analogies  1%  generated using the structure-mapping approach imply two entity mappings  1% imply three entity mappings  and 1% imply four or more. the average mapping richness of a structure-mapped analogy is thus 1.
1	analysis of results 
the results of this comparison  as summarized in table 1 below  force us to draw some important conclusions about the utility of hownet for analogy.

coverage.1.1.1recall.1.1.1parsimony.1.1.1richness1.1.1table 1: comparison of both approaches to analogy in hownet
first  though the taxonomic approach is capped by the limited use of self-reference among hownet definitions  it demonstrates a recall rate that closely approaches this ceiling  managing to find analogies of non-trivial complexity for 1 in 1 hownet definitions. because of its broader coverage  structure-mapping does considerably better  generating analogies for 1 in 1 definitions. a combination of both approaches   combo  in table 1  generates analogies for almost 1 in 1 definitions  which is most encouraging given the creative demands of analogy generation. this is especially so as we have considered here analogies between unique definitions  not unique words. a given definition-level analogy can be lexically realized in many  sometimes hundreds  of different ways.
1	conclusions and future work
we conclude then that hownet contains sufficient structure to realistically support both a taxonomic abstraction view and a structure-mapping view of analogy generation. nonetheless  we need to investigate additional sources of semantic content to further increase the recall of the abstraction approach. for this  we must turn to the implicit content hidden in hownet's lexico-semantic structure.
　perhaps surprisingly  one source of implicit semantic content is orthography. most chinese entries in hownet are multi-character - and thus multi-morpheme - terms whose composite orthography affords a kind of semantic transparency that other writing systems  e.g.  that of english  do not possess. thus  手术刀  meaning  scalpel   is a composite not just of characters but of ideas  for 手术 means  surgery  and 刀 means  knife . likewise  哲学家  which translates as  philosopher   is a composition of 哲学   philosophy   and 家   specialist  or  scientist  . in turn  philosophy|哲学is ontologized by hownet as a specialization of knowledge|知识  as is logic|辩学  mathematics|数学  lexicography|词典学and even midwifery|产科学. by decomposing compound terms in this way  and by generalizing the extracted modifiers  a three-level taxonomy can be constructed to complement that which is formed by taxonomic signatures. from these examples alone  the partial taxonomy of figure 1 can be derived:
knowledge-human mathematics-human mathematician|数学家
philosophy-human philosopher|哲学家
midwifery-human midwife|产科
buddhism-human
buddhist|佛教徒
figure 1: portion of an alternate three-level hierarchy derived from chinese compound terms  prefix term + hypernym .
the analogical potential of such an alternative signature scheme becomes clear when one notices that it immediately supports plato's classical analogy of philosopher as midwife.
