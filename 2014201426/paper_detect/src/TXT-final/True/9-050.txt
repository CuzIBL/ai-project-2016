introduction 
　　　the goal of the research to be discussed here is to develop a model of how persons can a r r i v e at an i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the social actions of other persons. by i n t e r p r e t a t i o n is meant the layman's a b i l i t y to determine the reasons that might have motivated another person's a c t i o n . this question of how man determines the intentions of another person's actions is of central importance to the area of social 
psychology. one person's i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the actions of another almost i n v a r i a b l y affects the way in which the observer reacts to and evaluates the actor. this process of naive i n t e n t i o n a l analysis is also c r u c i a l l y involved in communication s i t u a t i o n s . the p s y c h i a t r i c interview and diplomatic exchanges are q u a s i - r i t u a l ized examples of communication s i t u a t i o n s where the importance of i n t e n t i o n a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s is dramatica l l y present.

plays in human language and discourse .1. however  very l i t t l e a t t e n t i o n has been given to the explicat i o n of the l o g i c that underlies man's capacity to i n f e r the i n t e n t i o n a l basis f o r another's a c t i o n . i t is hoped that the present work w i l l begin to f i l l t h i s gap in our approach to the i n v e s t i g a t i o n of the 
processes involved in human communication. 
　　　working w i t h i n the area of social psychology heider1 has provided an e x t r a o r d i n a r i l y tich analysis of social perception and a number of t h e o r i s t s have provided important extensions and r e i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s 
of t h i s a n a l y s i s ' ' * however  the absence of an adequate formalism which is both r i c h and e x p l i c i t enough to do j u s t i c e to these t h e o r e t i c a l schemas has hampered the development of t h i s area. the purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of employing c e r t a i n ideas drawn from work in a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e in developing a theory of social perception. 
　　　before proceeding to the s p e c i f i c manner in which we have attempted to account for t h i s type of social understanding  it w i l l be useful to b r i e f l y state the major psychological properties that must he incorporated w i t h i n a theory of social understanding. 
　　　the basic assumption of man's common-sense theory of human action is that man has choice. without t h i s assumption the notion of i n t e n t i o n would be superfluous and the concept of personal causation would be no d i f f e r e n t than that of non-personal causation. however  personal causation is not a concept that can be defined independently of the common-sense concept of physical causation. the person is acting in a 
physical system and is therefore constrained by t h i s system. in order to explain the why of choice  t h i s naive theory must be capable of determining when choices are a v a i l a b l e   which p a r t i c u l a r choices are 
possible  and what outcomes follow as necessary or possible consequents of a p a r t i c u l a r action that could be chosen. thus there is a r e l a t i o n between these two concepts of causality and the answer to the question of why a person chose to act in a p a r t i c u l a r way involves showing how the p a r t i c u l a r act or act sequence chosen might or did lead to the achievement of the a c t o r ' s goal. 
　　　this i n t e r r e l a t i o n between the physical and the personal causative systems is r e f l e c t e d in heider's suggestion that personal causation involves two sets of conditions which he labels the can and the try conditions. using these terms the basic p o s t d i c t i v e axiom of personal causation may be w r i t t e n as 
	cause cp w  ---  cancp.w  a 	try  p uo 
where w represents either an act  e.g. give  pt p   x  or an outcome condition  e.g. get   p .   x   . this axiom states that if the naive observer believes that a person  p  i n t e n t i o n a l l y caused some act or outcome  then the observer w i l l i n f e r that the person was able to do the act or cause the outcome and was motivated to do the act or cause the outcome. the s p e c i f i c reason that motivated the actor is simply a 
p a r t i c u l a r proof of try  p w  that the observer's b e l i e f system can derive from the axioms  theorems  and data that are c u r r e n t l y present in the observer's b e l i e f system. these try axioms represent the assumptions of the observer's common sense psychol o g i c a l theory. 
　　　in addition to the capacity to p o s t d i c t i v e l y i n t e r p r e t the actions of others  we are also at times

overview of the model 
　　　it has been assumed that this ability to structure and interpret social actions implies that the observer is acting as a kind of extended problem solving system. a typical problem solving system is given a goal and then attempts to find a sequence of legal moves that transform the i n i t i a l state into a state which satisfies the goal conditions. the observer of social actions assumes that the actors are engaged in problem solving activity - that they have goals -- but the observer does not typically know what specific goals are being pursued. therefore  the observer must possess a set of rules  termed try rules  which implicitly specify the set of psychologically permissable goals. this set of try rules corresponds to the axioms of the try component of the axiom of personal causation. 
　　　these try rules are of two different types. the f i r s t type are termed the general try rules. these rules represent the axioms of human motivation that the observer believes to be applicable to all persons. the hedonism rule mentioned previously is an example of a rule of this type. the second type of try rules are termed dispositional try rules. in general  these latter rules are applied only if the general try rules 
f a i l . these dispositional rules are the rules which are used to make inferences concerning the personality of the actors  and these rules are the source of the naive theory of personality. an example will help to clarify this distinction. most persons that we know act honestly most of the time. nonetheless  very few of us would characterize the majority of persons whom we know as possessing the t r a i t 'honest'. thus  acting honestly is not in and of i t s e l f a sufficient basis for inferring that a person is honest. however  if a person acts honestly in a situation where he can gain nothing from acting honestly and would gain much and lose nothing from acting dishonestly  then that person is honest. in terms of try rules  the person broke a hedonism rule in acting honestly and it is this deviation from the general try rules that creates the occasion for a dispositional rule to apply. 
　　　the identification of a permissable goal in the situation is not sufficient. the goal identified must f i t the data provided by the actions. that is  the observer must be able to establish that an action or action sequence represents a set of moves that are consistent with the attainment of the goal state specified by a particular try rule. this implies that the naive theory must possess a set of rules of action. these action rules must specify not only the conditions that must hold in the situation in order for the action to be taken  but also the set of outcome conditions that may result if the action is taken. using these rules  the observer's interpretive system is capable of determining whether the can component of 
the axiom of personal causation is true. it is this aspect of the model that is analogous to a problem solving system. 
　　　by using the can condition in conjunction with the try rules a unique interpretation of a sequence of actions can often be obtained. however  at times several interpretations are possible and the situation is ambiguous. if the observer possesses some previously inferred beliefs about the actors  these beliefs are often utilized to help resolve the ambiguity. we have termed this set of rules the consistency rules. the basic notion that these rules are meant to capture is that if the observer already has inferred that the actor possesses a certain disposition  then interpretations that are inconsistent with the existing dispositional beliefs are avoided. a mean  helpful person or an honest  dishonest person does not seem to be psychologically believable. the fact that this type of personality configuration is in some sense anomalous provides a basis for the argument that the naive theory must possess these consistency rules which function as a kind of meta-theory of personality organization. if these rules are violated we tend to look deeper into the situation in search of a more acceptable interpretation. thus  this set of rules acts as a kind of monitor and f i l t e r of the output of the can and try rules. 
representation o f actions  persons and situations 
     natural language is the major system of expression used to inform others of intentions  to discuss plans  and to t e l l stories. 	gesture  facial expression  posture and intonation are also used to communicate intention and emotion  but the subtleties of these systems of expression are beyond the scope of our 
model. for these reasons  we have looked to natural language for an appropriate set of concepts and 
properties for representing actions  persons and situations. the underlying assumption that has been adopted is that lexical items describing properties of persons and verbs describing interpersonal actions are related in a systematic fashion and that much of the logic of personal causation is implicit in our language. 
　　　it is useful to think of the verbs of english as falling into two general classes. the f i r s t class specifies either the existence of a property of an entity or a relation between entities. examples of verbs used to communicate the existence of properties of persons are: has  owns  knows  believes  is able to  wants  and needs. verbs specifying the existence of relations between persons are exemplified by the verbs: married to  son of  friend of  likes  hates  and dominates. the second class of verbs are those which can be used to describe interpersonal actions. these include verbs usually employed to describe the exchange of physical objects  e.g. give  take  buy  sell  steal  as well as verbs used to describe the exchange of information  e.g. t e l l   ask  command  insult  beg  and threaten . aside from these actions of exchange there are also verbs used to denote movement  ingestion  and so on. however  the exchange acts appear to be the most crucially involved in describing social actions. for this reason  it is this class of action verbs that has been given the most attention. 
     the verbs specifying properties and relations and those denoting action are related in an interesting way. 	verbs of action generally presuppose the existence of certain properties in the situation. 	for example  give presupposes that the actor intends the action and that the actor possesses the object which is being given. 	furthermore  each action verb carries 
with it some information concerning the consequences that necessarily or possibly result after the action has been taken. this observation supports the assumption that underlying each action verb is knowledge of an action schema which defines a partial function consisting of a set of antecedent properties that must hold immediately prior to the occurrence of the act and a set of consequent properties that may hold after the action has been taken. stated more formally  an act schema is represented as: 
1 　name act   e 1 . e 1 . . .   -*-  try flag  * {pc} /  1c  where  1c  ＊ {noc} u {poc . the action schema consists on the left side of the name of the act together with a set of dummy arguments  e1 e1 . .  which restrict the class of entities that can be substituted as actor  recipient  object  and instrument of the act. the right side includes the try flag whose value is non-nil if the action implies intention on the part of the actor  the set {pc} which contains the l i s t of preconditions on the act  and the set {oc} which designates the set of outcome conditions associated with the action. the slash is used to visually segregate the preconditions from the outcome conditions. the set of outcome conditions is partitioned into the set that necessarily occur if the action is performed {noc}  and those that possibly happen  {poc}  if the action is performed. these pre- and post-conditions consist of properties and relations that may hold in the situation in which the action occurs. thus  the function of the f i r s t class of verbs is to partially specify the state of the world and the latter class  the action verbs  serve as the operators that can transform the present situation into a future situation. 
　　　a particular person is represented as a l i s t structure headed by the person's name. this l i s t structure is differentiated into the general property classes listed in figure 1. beneath each class are examples of particular properties of that class. this structure is motivated by the rules of the belief system rather than by any a-priori psychological hypothesis. except for the disposition and wants classes  each of these properties can enter as members of the set of pre- and post-conditions associated with an act schema. what happens to a person simply involves either getting or losing properties belonging to one of these seven classes. the knowledge and belief classes are used to differentiate what is cognitively available from what is believed. 
     in addition to the name of each particular property the belief system associates a value with each property. 	this value represents the system's belief concerning the person's evaluation of the property. 	two sources of value are distinguished. the f i r s t is the property's intrinsic value and represents man and society's general assumptions about what is good  bad or indifferent. 	this value is static and relatively context free. 	the second source of value is dynamic and context sensitive and is termed pragmatic value. 	this is the value that a 
property takes on by virtue of its role in enabling or blocking a particular outcome. for example  the intrinsic value of possessing a club foot is probably 
negative  but if the existence of this property can block a young man from being drafted then that young man may  for this reason  value this property quite highly. in general  the pragmatic value depends on the value of the outcome that is enabled or blocked. 
　　　the want properties represent the belief system's l i s t of goals that are thought to be currently relevant to the person. these goals are used primarily as a source of candidate goals when the system is attempting to draw projective implications. 
　　　the dispositional properties are also related to the operation of the try component. a disposition is associated with a person if a particular dispositional try rule was used to explain some previous action of the person. a dispositional property such as helpful or honest is the memory tag for this previous inference about the person. associated with a dispositional property is a set of coordinates giving the location of the disposition in an implicational space of disposition terms. these coordinates are person name

e.g. sick  hungry  healthy  etc. 
 1  emotional states: 
e.g. happy  sad  angry  etc. 
 1  abilities: 
e.g. able to perform surgery  able to play chess  etc. 
 1  possessions: 
e.g. has $1  has ferrari  etc.

e.g. knows mary has a headache  knows auto mechanic claims the crankshaft must be replaced  etc.

e.g. believes mary has a headache  believes the crankshaft doesn't need replacing  etc. 
 1  interpersonal relationships: 
	 a  	unit relations 
e.g. person married to mary  person father of tom  etc. 
	 b  	sentiment relations 
e.g. person loves mary  person hates sam  etc. 
	 c  	dominance relations 
e.g. person boss of larry  person employee of sam  etc.

e.g. is helpful  is honest 
 1  wants 
e.g. wants to be friend of susie  etc. 
	figure 1. 	properties of persons 
used by the consistency rules to maintain a permissable personality structure. 
     the situation or environment also consists of a l i s t of properties. these properties are used in an ad hoc fashion and consist of the environmental conditions that must be known by the belief system in order to interpret a particular input. for example  in order for a medical doctor to operate on a patient the appropriate medical environment must be available. rather than attempting to systematize a l l of the environmental information that might be needed this information is created when it is necessary. 
input representation 
     the input of a situation and set of actions is represented as a l i s t consisting of three major sublists corresponding to persons  environmental conditions  and actions. the l i s t of persons is composed 
of the names of a l l persons involved in the story together with the l i s t of properties that are believed to hold for each of these persons at the start of the story. 	the environmental conditions are likewise a l i s t of all of the environmental properties that are believed to exist at the start of the story. 	this 

1 
information is either provided by the narrator or it is retrieved from a f i l e where permanent properties are stored. these two sublists represent the i n i t i a l situation  s . 
     using the set of act schemas a fully instantiated and ordered tree of the actions and their pre- and post-conditions is created. this action tree together with s  represent all of the information provided as input. the action tree is then searched for action dependencies. this is done by starting with the last action  act   and searching to determine whether any of the preconditions for act were created by some previous action  act   . if so  then a link is created connecting act   and act . if no prior enabling act is found then'it is assumed that the precondition existed at the start of the story and a link is created pointing back to the i n i t i a l situation s . this search for enabling connections is carried out over all previous acts for all preconditions on each act. 
　　　two kinds of inferences are made as a result of this process. the f i r s t involves previously unknown and unspecified properties of persons or the environment. i f   for example  one act was that 'john drove a car to the airport'  then the belief system could infer from this that john possessed the ability to drive a car. this type of inference  while rather mundane  is the source of our ability to f i l l in a large amount of the information that is implicit in a story. a second and more interesting type of inference involves the distinction between the types of outcomes that are associated with actions  namely  these that necessarily follow and those that possibly follow from the action. if an outcome that is represented as a possible outcome of some act. is found to be a precondition for a subsequent action  act.  and this condition is not known to have held previous to act.  then the system infers that this possible outcome actually happened and changes its representation accordingly. this type of inference is particularly important for inferring a person's beliefs. for example  if a medical doctor tells john that his wife 
must have an operation we know that john believes that the doctor believes that the operation is necessary. however  john may or may not believe in the necessity of the operation. however  if john hires the doctor to operate on his wife then it is possible to infer that in fact john also believes that the operation is necessary and the doctor's act of telling was actually an act of convincing. 
     in this way the action dependency function f i l l s out the story and also narrows down the potential set of outcomes. 	by locating action dependencies that might exist between the actions  this function provides a partially structured representation that is 
interpreted by the try rules. 
try rules 
　　　four types of general try rules and the dispositional try rules have been developed. the general try rules include hedonism  extended hedonism  reciprocity and normative rules. hedonism is the common-sense notion that actions may be taken because outcomes beneficial to the actor are expected to result. extended hedonism generalizes this notion to include the possibility that the actor expects the outcomes to benefit some person connected to the actor by a positive unit or sentiment relation  for example a son or a friend. the core idea of reciprocity is that persons are expected to respond in kind to the actions of others. normative rules represent beliefs about cultural or legal norms that apply 
1 

     extended hedonism is developed in the same fashion as hedonism except that the outcome is associated 
with someone with whom the actor is related by a positive sentiment or unit relation. for example  to help a friend would satisfy extended hedonism. 
　　　the principle of reciprocity can also be extended in a very powerful way. however  a very tedious development of notation is needed to express the ideas formally. therefore  a brief and informal 
sketch will suffice. the reciprocity condition is that if some previous action of b  act.  has some ye{oc.} that could or did affect a and1a believes that b intended the act  then if a does some act. such that some ze{1c.} can or does affect b in aj similar way  then a's action is explained by reciprocity. again  this notion can be extended over possible worlds and can also be extended recursively in a fashion analogous to the hedonism rules. therefore  reciprocity can be used to explain even very indirect connections such as preemptive strike where a hits b because a believes that b's act is part of an enabling sequence that will allow b to hit a. reci-
procity is also extended in a way analogous to extended hedonism. that i s   if b hurts a's friend  then a may hurt b or a friend of b and so on. 
　　　the disposition rules also possess some interesting properties. the english language is f i l l e d with dispositional concepts  for example  helpful  exploitative  etc. the interesting property of these terms is that many of the terms are derived rather directly from verbs or actions. this suggests that some of the action rules may be used as the basis for dispositional try rules. however  these try rules can apply only when certain of the general try rules are broken. to demonstrate this approach  the disposition rule for 'helpful' w i l l be developed. 
the act rule for 'help' is defined as 
　　　this capacity to determine interpretations of actions from a particular actor's point-of-view is also involved whenever projective implications are made. there are two classes of conditions that commonly involve projection. the f i r s t occurs whenever alter-
native choices of action are considered. 	for example  
in an episode where john has stolon some money which enables his wife to have a needed operation  an extended hedonism rule is satisfied but a normative rule is broken. the resolution of this ambiguity 
may depend upon whether or not from john's point-ofview it can be shown that the can of alternative courses of action  such as attempting to borrow the money  are true. the second case involving projective implication occurs when the system attempts to complete a partial plan. for example  if all that is known is that john's wife is in need of an operation and that john has stolen some money  then the system should be capable of determining whether or not john's action 
may actually be an enabling action in a larger causal 
sequence. 
　　　attempts to project the implications of an action sequence often involve a search over a very large set of possible goals and possible paths. therefore  this capacity must be used by man only under a narrow range of conditions and the system must possess a powerful set of heuristics to guide and limit this search. the nature of these heuristics is still very much in question. abelson1 in his work on the hierarchical structure of belief systems has suggested that plans may be organized into themes and these themes themselves may be elements of a larger structure termed scripts. this is a very intriguing suggestion and perhaps the incorporation of more complex structures of this type will provide the means for efficiently projecting plans. at present  our model is clearly deficient in this regard.
