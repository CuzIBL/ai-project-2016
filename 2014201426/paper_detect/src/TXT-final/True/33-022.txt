i introduction 
our approach to cope with the 
formidable complexity of doallng with natural language as well as learning is to divide the e f f o r t i n t o two stages. 	tho f i r s t - s t a g e system w i l l begin with sensori-
motor mechanisms rnd learn on interpretationol machinery that enables comparatively 
p r i m i t i v e language processing* the secondstage system w i l l start with such an i n t e r p r e t a t i o n a l machinery and loarn formal logic and grammar of the language that support complex performance. 
　　　we have described elsewhere  l 1 1  tho teachlng  language acquisition and 
understanding machinery of pl as  a language acquisition system belonging to the f i r s t stage  plas is analogy-based and learns through examples  the primitives of i t s 
knowledge representation are not grammatical constructs but natural languago expressions thomselves. these primitives are learnt through interaction in the very same language that is being acquired  arguments for the above f u t u r e s are available i n   l t o 1     . 
　　　though the language machinery of plas can cope  within i t s scope  with spatial as well as temporal aspects of the external world  i t s sonsorl-motor machinory cannot represent the temporal aspocts. moreovor  though it can ler.rn to understand new 
phrases and sentences  i t s capability to acquire words is comparatlvoly l i m i t e . this paper proposes extensions to remove these limitations   c a l l tho extended plas as plas.t . 
	ii 	intial 	knowledge. teaching 
　　　the world of plas.t is a system of aspects  e.g. : tho meaning of yesterday  male 1  and aspoct-classes  o.g! the class of past events  tho class of males  of the exterml world  rnd utterances and 
uttoranco-classes i . e .   language schemmes or simply schemes   o . g . : scm1fcdy wi tt somffltkr* sometime i . e .   * - wbjt - -   of tho l i n g u i s t i c world. 
　　　plas.t starts with a system of sonsorl-motor aspects  a sonsorl-motor aspect is nn aspect of tho external world that plas.t bocomos nware of through i t s sensing and manipulating capabilities. for example  a specific action such as walking  a specific agent.  and aspectclnssos. 
       since tho case structures nro clocor to tho structures loarnt by plas♀1  and schank's cen representation ♀ e j is language-free  we propose to use cw to represent tho sensorl-motor knowledge given above. however  cdn w i l l not be used to represent the aystorn of aspocts and aspect-elates at tho language l o v o l . wo bollevo that a person's languago plays t key rolo in dotormining his modol of tho world and thus structuring his thought  1j . 
　　　utterances  sonsorl-motor aspocts and ospoct-classos are primltivoly rolatod by the toachor as in plas ♀ l j by naming. 
for oxnmplo  
ckairl; chair  aciiair;* 
 ft' stands for a cen-representation of tho sensori-motor aspect-class corresponding to tho class of chairs. the example informs tho system that chair  a chair are names of the aspect chairi belonging to tho aspect-cla*s spool fled by a. all 
n-mo-uttorpneos need not be introduced by naming. 	plas.t  using tho acquisition 
machlnory of plas and tho techniques dlscussod below  can learn them by analogy.

　　　the teacher can also associate a l i n g u i s t i c and a sensori-motor representations of on ovont by the oxtro-lingulstlc 
marker 'describes' which simulates the 
o x t r a - l i n g u l s t i c behaviour v i z .   simultaneously pointing to  and describing  a situation. for example  other marker simulates tho extral i n g u i s t i c means that enable tho hoofer to imagine a now situation and relate its representation with tho present one. with tho holp of such associations between statements  nnd tho analogy-based capability of plas to transform utterances  details in   l   1   1    . plas.t can convert tho tense of a statement.
