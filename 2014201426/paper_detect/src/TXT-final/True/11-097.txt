       image understanding system ius  constructs a d e s c r i p t i o n of the scene being viewed from an array of image sensory data: i n t e n s i t y   c o l o r   and sometimes range data. image understanding is best chara c t e r i z e d by d e s c r i p t i o n   whereas p a t t e r n r e c o g n i t ion by c l a s s i f i c a t i o n   and image processing by image o u t p u t . the l e v e l and scope of the goal d e s c r i p t i o n depend on the task given to the ius: whether it is i n t e r p r e t a t i o n   o b j e c t d e t e c t i o n   change d e t e c t i o n   image matching  e t c . it may appear t h a t the d i s c u s sion i n t h i s paper w i l l take u s a l l y the f l a v o r o f scene i n t e r p r e t a t i o n from a monocular i n t e n s i t y image.

i i . 	levels of description 	in image understanding 
       d e s c r i p t i o n s are not only the goal c o n s t r u c t s   but also the media through which various components of an ius communicate in the course of understand-
ing the image. 	there are a few orthogonal dimensions. 
a  	p r o c e s s i n g - u n i t hierarchy 
       this is a h i e r a r c h y in the l e v e l s of u n i t s used in processing. let us i d e n t i f y f i v e l e v e l s f o r the moment. for a region-based ius  they are p i x e l  an image p o i n t     patch a group of contiguous p i x e l s having s i m i l a r p i x e l p r o p e r t i e s     region a meaningful group of patches corresponding to a surface of an o b j e c t     subimage a p a r t of an image corresponding to an o b j e c t or a set of o b j e c t s     and o b j e c t   a n o b j e c t as a r e a l e n t i t y   . for a l i n e based ius  the l e v e l of patch can be replaced by l i n e segment  region by l i n e   and subimage by a set of l i n e s corresponding to an o b j e c t   f i g . 1 i l l u s t r a t e s these l e v e l s f o r a region-based ius. 
       akin & reddy 1  observed t h a t s i x l e v e l s are used when human subjects understand the contents of an image through v e r b a l conversation: scene  c l u s t e r   o b j e c t   r e g i o n   segment  and i n t e n s i t y . the number of l e v e l s is not very s i g n i f i c a n t . these l e v e l s as w e l l as those in f i g . 1 depend on the u n i t s on which d i f f e r e n t l e v e l s of processing are performed and f o r whose d e s c r i p t i o n d i f f e r e n t vocabularies are used. processing i n the p i x e l - t o - p a t c h l e v e l i s o f t e n c a l l e d as l o w - l e v e l processing. the r e g i o n - t o - s u b image l e v e l is high l e v e l in the p i c t u r e processing domain. it c l e a r l y needs to deal w i t h semantics which stem from the h i g h e s t   o b j e c t l e v e l . the p a t c h t o - r e g i o n l e v e l might be c a l l e d as i n t e r m e d i a t e . 
b  	view domain / sceno domain d i s t i n c t i o n   
       the p o i n t to be noted here is the c l e a r d i s p a r i t y e x i s t i n g between view-domain and scene-domain d e s c r i p t i o n s ; in f i g . 1  the lower four l e v e l s are in the view domain and the upper one in scene domain. the need f o r t h i s d i s t i n c t i o n was argued f o r f i r s t and most e f f e c t i v e l y by clowes 1 . he used the term   p i c t u r e domain  in place of  view domain . but the l a t t e r is used in t h i s paper to mean the domain of observable f a c t s by viewing the scene in e i t h e r i n t e n s i t y or range data. the importance of t h i s d i s t i n c t i o n i s r e a d i l y understood b y t h i n k i n g t h a t   f o r example  the a c t u a l meaning of  adjacency  in the view-domain d e s c r i p t i o n is f u l l y understood only a f t e r the r e l a t i o n i s i n t e r p r e t e d i n the scene-domain d e s c r i p t i o n . note that the scene-domain d e s c r i p t i o n s are not n e c e s s a r i l y in a m e t r i c a l 1-d coordinate space; e . g .   w a l t z ' s labels of edge is a symbolic system to represent the edge types in the 1-d 
       space  or even a gross s u b j e c t i v e space w i l l s u f f i c e . 
c  	d e t a i l hierarchy and composition hierarchy 
       the d e t a i l h i e r a r c h y is along preciseness of d e s c r i p t i o n . it can e x i s t in both the view and the scene domains. section 1 presents examples in the view domain. an example in the scene domain is the d e s c r i p t i o n of o v e r a l l / d e t a i l shape of an o b j e c t   which is found in s e c t i o n 1 . 1 b   . the composition  or p a r t - o f   h i e r a r c h y represents p a r t / w h o l e r e l a t i o n s h i p s in the scene domain. 
       the p r o c e s s i n g - u n i t h i e r a r c h y a c t u a l l y contains somewhat both aspects of the d e t a i l and composition h i e r a r c h i e s in the sense t h a t the l o w - l e v e l e n t i t i e s are p a r t s and d e t a i l s of an u p p e r - l e v e l e n t i t y . u n f o r t u n a t e l y t h i s revealed h i e r a r c h y does not d i r e c t l y correspond t o the h i e r a r c h i e s which n a t u r a l ly e x i s t in the scene domain. this f a c t makes image understanding d i f f i c u l t   and it is why the models o f t e n need to represent the n a t u r a l h i e r a r c h i e s

	i i i . 	model representation 
there are many kinds of knowledge for an ius. 
the task world of an ius is defined f i r s t of a l l by what objects or class of objects  are concerned and how they behave and interact to form a scene. therefore let us confine ourselves to the object-model representations. corresponding to the levels of description it can take several forms. 
1 	view-domain models 
　　　this is an approach in which properties and relations in the view-domain descriptions are stored as the model of an object. it is interesting to observe that most of the region-based scene-interpretation programs have taken this approach. the region analysis of image was f i r s t used by brice & fennema 1 . 
a  	graph matching at region level 
　　　the f i r s t group of the region-based view-model approach includes barrow & popplestone 1  and preparata ε ray  1 . they store 
properties of and the relations between regions in the form of a graph; the nodes correspond to the regions in the image which correspond to surfaces of an object or part of an object  while arcs correspond to relations between regions. 	interpretation consists of graph matching or subgraph matching  i . e .   finding the  best  assignments of part or object names to nodes of the graph obtained from the image  so that specifications stored in the model graph are maximally satisfied. 
　　　it is apparent that the approach can not cope with occlusions or rotations of objects that change the graph structure drastically. but a more serious limitation is that it is assumed that the  almost  
perfect  meaningful partitioning of the image into regions i.e.  region-level descriptions of the image  is obtained independently  which is now known to be very d i f f i c u l t . 
b  	semantic grouping of patches into region 
yakimovsky & feldman 1  and tenenbaum & 
barrow 1  are the next group. they tried to overcome that limitation. the image is f i r s t partitioned into many small patches of uniform color. to this patch-level description of the image  a merging operation is repeatedly applied  with which the operation of giving an interpretation to the patch is combined. that i s   besides intensity and color data  semantic constraints are introduced in deciding a possible merge  by means of a set of 
probabilities yakimovsky  et.al. 1  or a constraint table tenenbaum  et.al. 1  about combinations of object-name labels and region-level properties and relations such as adjacent  above  etc. some uniform  domain-independent procedures are used to find a  best  segmentation; in the former  it is  sub  optimization of combinational probability that regions have correct labels  and in the latter  it is the use of f i l t e r i n g procedure together with a relaxation method which repeatedly eliminates and suppresses inconsistent labels from a set of possible labels for each patch. 
　　　it was an advance that they succeeded in introducing some semantics into image segmentation. 	but because a l l the patches and regions are uniformly treated and knowledge is scattered in the constraint representation of one level patch level   the program does not know what objects it is dealing with at each moment. 	therefore  neither explicit processing of the shape of object nor object-dependent processing on part of image is easy. the reason  in the context of fig. 1  is that the uniform procedure does not construct a subimage-level or evenaregion-level description to control where and what to look at. 
　　　the limitations mentioned above are not inherent to region-based interpretation schemes. they stem mainly from failures in handling the processing-unit hierarchy explicitly and in constructing each level of descriptions in the inter-
pretation process. if this is solved properly  then regions can be powerful description primitives for natural scenes  as lines are for polyhedral scenes. 
1 	three-dimensional shape model 
a  	computer graphics metaphor 
　　　the most straightforward object model stores 1-d shape data as in computer graphics. in the pioneering work of roberts 1    the object model was very straightforward; it was a set of 1-d coordinates of the vertices of polyhedra. 

invited papers-1: kanade 1 

　　　the input image is processed and transformed into a line drawing. the matching process consists 
of the following processes; 1  junctions in the line drawing are selected that may constitute a simple polyhedron  wedge or parallelepiped   1  the proposed polyhedron in the 1-d model is generalizedtransformed  rotated  translated  scaled  and projected  to match the selected junctions  and 1  the matched piece is then removed and the remainder is considered. here no view-domain model is employed. everything is considered in the 1-d space. the interaction of objects is treated as addition and subtraction of volumes in the 1-d space. the upward flow from view to scene is based on simple heuristics relating a view to the object model; e.g.  a set of junctions that form three parallelograms are possibly from a parallelepiped. falk 1  is in the same s p i r i t ; in order to deal with imperfect line drawings  an aggregate of local cues such as y  l or arrow junctions are used to hypothesize a plausible object model. 
　　　more recent extremes of this line of pursuit  perhaps with increased manipulation power  are the geometric modeling by baumgart 1  and a program that uses braid's scheme braid  1  for computer vision  popplestone  brown  ambler & crawford  1 . the system by baumgart produces polyhedral approximations to 1-d shape from multiple views of an object. the system by popplestone  et. al constructs 1-d body models by using the technique of projecting light stripes to know the surface shape. these might be described as the inverse of computer graphics problem. 
b  	generalized-cylinder representation 
　　　a generalized cylinder is formed by moving a two-dimensional cross section along an axis. the cross section need not remain constant and the axis need not be straight; an ordinary cylinder is a circle moved along a line through i t s center. if the circle shrinks linearly  then it is a cone. an object is represented by decomposing it into parts each of which is a generalized cylinder. agin & binford 1  and nevatia ε binford 1  used range data by means of a laser range finder to obtain the generalized-cylinder representation of objects such as a doll and a horse  and then matched the obtained description against the models. 
　　　marr & nishihara 1  showed a hierarchical representation of 1-d shapes using cones. a human figure is f i r s t approximated by a cone. it is then detailed by joining component cones head and limbs  to the principal cone torso . each further component e.g. arm  can be redetailed in turn  and so on. this scheme can answer overall questions about the object like the gross shape  the direction in which it points  etc. and also one can go into as appro-
ing in simple polyhedral scenes and with skeletonization in 1-d figures  however  it is f e l t that it is very d i f f i c u l t to obtain the axes reliably and to construct the description which the model of that object expects without some feedback of hypothesis-and-test  except the case of obiects basically composed of sticks . more remains to be done in this respect  but it is true that the representation of overall/detail hierarchy w i l l provide a sequence of cues that can be used in hypothesizing plausible shape models for understanding the input image  if it is explicitly related to the processing-unit hierarchy. in fact  it is shown that the contour  an overall description of the processing unit  may be closely related to the generalized-cylinder representation marr 1 . 
1 	relating scene constraints to view constraints 
　　　in several cases  image-forming models are successfully formulated and provide methods of working in 
the view domain to obtain the scene-domain description. 
a  	line-drawing interpretation 
　　　waltz's program waltz 1  for line-drawing interpretation can be counted as a most typical success. though seemingly similar  it has a very different s p i r i t from guzman 1 which decomposes a line drawing into bodies. guzman classified junctions of lines in the image  and considered them to give heuristically some local evidence concerning the possible association of regions in forming bodies. for example  an arrow junction provides evidence for some association between the two regions on either side of the central line. guzman's 
program worked f a i r l y well  but i t s limitation came from sticking to the view domain. 
　　　to the contrary  following huffman 1  and clowes 1   waltz 1  classified edges according to their scene-domain  physical meaning: concave  convex  crack  shadow  etc. possible junctions are enumerated from the possible views of 
physically possible vertices that arbitrary t r i hedral solids w i l l generate. then they are indexed to give a catalog of legal line combinations for each type of junctions. having the catalog prepared  the interpretation of a line drawing reduces to searching for a set of line labels that provide a legal configuration at each junction in the image. the procedure systematically eliminates incompatible labels from a line when the junctions at both ends of the line is considered together. astonishingly enough  it was found that this iteration scheme  called   f i l t e r i n g     rapidly converges to a unique interpretation or to a small number of interpretations for most cases. 
　　　this success achieved by shifting from guzman to waltz is that waltz begins with the deep struc-

priate detail as wanted. note that the hierarchies ture  scene-domain meaning  and relates it to the represented here are the detail and composition constraints computable in the view domain. a simihierarchies intrinsic to the object. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　lar approach for line drawings of curved objects is taken by turner  1    although with more complexity. as for the recognition problem from a monocular image  marr & nishihara 1  write that work has been

the gradient space approach huffman 1; mackworth 1 . if z=f x y  defines the surface of the object  the local surface orientation can 
be expressed using   and the gradient space is the space defined by  p q . for a particular choice of viewer-object geometry  lightsource  and a kind of object surface  it can be calculated how the intensity data i  depends on 
p and q; i . e .    p q  -  i  p q  . for example  in the simplest case where a light source is at the viewer and the object surface reflectivity is proportional to cosine of the incident angle of light  then 

this means that the points with a given intensity have such orientations determined by a circle in the gradient space. other constraints in the gradient space can be used in conjunction with this constraint to determine the orientation uniquely for each point. for example  the three surfaces of a trihedral vertex correspond to three points in the gradient space and the lines connecting these points must be perpendicular to the three lines joining at the corresponding junction in the image. 
　　　a practical example of combining picture processing with simple camera geometry is found in yoda  motoike & ejiri 1 . it provides an insensitiveto-noise algorithm that obtains the normalized top view of a box-like object on a table from its oblique image. the histogram of edge-segment directions  
when modified in accordance with camera angle  gives reliably the orientation of the box on the table. 
　　　all the representations and procedures mentioned above can be thought of as compiled knowledge that relates scene-domain constraints to viewdomain constraints winston  1 . 
	to sum up the 	three preceding subsections: 
1  scene-domain knowledge is crucial. 
1  the processing-unit hierarchy should be explicit-ly represented and handled. mingling them results in the misuse of the descriptive vocabulary for shape and relations. 
1  1-d shape models embody generative nature to manage various cases  but in general they are weak in hypothesizing appropriate candidates for object 
models in recognition. hierarchical overall/ detail representations may be helpful  if properly related to the processing units. 
1  compiling the knowledge of relating scene constraints to view constraints is a powerful technique  but it works in the controlled world whose constraints have been  compiled  into the method. 
1 	multiple-view model 
　　　minsky 1  proposed the theory of frame systems as a unified theory of knowledge representation. as minsky describes them  when applied to vision most straightforwardly  frame systems are collections of related frames linked together; different frames describe the stereotyped view  not necessarily of a single object  but of a scene with multiple objects like a room  from different viewpoints  and the transformation from one frame to another represents the effect of moving from place to place. though very attractive as a psychological model  it seems that this multiple-view frame systems  as they are  have gone too far in neglecting direct  metrical processing of 1-d information. anyway it is not clear yet how well such representations work for real images  since no implementation exists yet. 
　　　the frame theory i t s e l f presents a foundation of representational schemes. among others  it advocates that matching against a stored set of expected prototypes and instantiating them are the central recognition process. each prototype should contain a chunk of data and procedures which are used in applying i t . these ideas can be developed in both the view domain and the scene domain. 
1 	structuring multiple-level descriptions 
　　　the importance of explicitly handling the hierarchy of image descriptions has been stressed. one thing we can do about the object model representation is to store knowledge applicable for each level of descriptions together with information about how it is related to the upper- and lower-level descriptions sakai  kanade & ohta 1  used symbolic  knowledge block  representations for outdoor-scene interpretation. here we extend it a l i t t l e to represent processing-unit hierarchy explicitly in i t . our system is region-based and  an image is f i r s t p a r t i tioned into a collection of patches by the recursive thresholding technique ohlander 1 ; see 1. thus we can assume that the image has been completely described in that level; a l l the properties of and relations between patches are known or computable. 
　　　as an example  the representation of a typical building would appear as in fig. 1. each block having a name starting with * is called a knowledge block kb . a kb can stand for not only a processing unit concerning an object  but also material  e.g.  *concrete   property e.g.  *rectangular   or relation e.g.  *inherit-prop . it is like a conceptual object in the krl bobrow & winograd  1  . 
　　　*building in the object level specifies its gross shape by *recblock. the parameters are its size  location and orientation. properties and relations 
valid in this level can be included. the object model is related to a few of the qualitatively d i f ferent views depending on the value of parameters. the connecting parameter values are given when working downward  and inferred when working upward. note that  especially in outdoor scenes  the size  location and orientation are relative matters. they need not be very precise for most cases as long as no contradictions occur. note also that the distant objects such as sky  or objects with fuzzy shape such as trees can be thought of as f l a t patterns perpendicular to the viewer. it might be said in this sense that the scene domain is a subjective 1/1-d space. 
　　　the view-domain units represent the hierarchy; how the subimage corresponding to a particular view is composed of regions  and how the region is composed of patches. the subimage kb contains a procedure to infer the scene-domain parameters. during the interpretation process  each kb for subimage or region-level unit generates i t s instance

       generally speaking  each kb contains three types of r u l e s : ask  select  and check. these r u l e s are represented e i t h e r by a l i s t of fuzzy p r e d i c a t e s   or as a procedural attachment bobrow & winograd  1 . the ask r u l e s are used to choose e n t i t i e s as candidates for the component of the i n s t a n t i a t i o n ; f o r example  a patch w i t h the p r o p e r t i e s of manyh o l e s   many-lines  i n n e r i t i n g - p r o p e r t i e s - o f *concrete  and a d j a c e n t - t o  skyregion w i t h l i n e a r boundary may w e l l become a component patch of *wall. the ask r u l e s f u n c t i o n as bottom-up t r i g g e r s of proposing an instance of the kb.

1 . 1 	from pass-oriented to heter achi cal 	control structure 
       the pass-oriented structure  or linear  bottom up  sequencing of transformations  is the most straightforward control structure; it builds up higher-level descriptions step by step. the typical sequence i s : 1  noise removal  1  edge-segment f i n d ing  1  grouping of edge segments  1  line drawing  and 1  interpretation. the lowest level is usually a universal technique. the higher the level i s   the more the process is domain-dependent. though it is simple and modular  such a control structure is not always r e l i a b l e . errors in the earlier stages seriously damage the later stages  and it is very d i f f i c u l t or even impossible to make the earlier stages error-free without using knowledge of the later stages. it is noted  however  that recently several people including marr 1  raise a r e consideration of this point; marr claims that it is necessary to c l a r i f y how much can be done in each stage independently  before going to r i c h and complex interactions between stages. 
       a hierarchical top-down gross-to-detail control  directed by a model  is an e f f i c i e n t way to detect a particular pattern in an image  harlow 1; ballard & sklansky 1 . the recognition process takes the form of a decision ladder or graph  whose subsequent lower nodes correspond to decisions to be made concerning more d e t a i l in a smaller area. 
a feedback analysis procedure was described in 

invited paper s-1: kanade 
1 

nagao 1   and exemplified in the face recognition programs sakai  nagao & kanade 1; kanade 1 . the program consists of many routines  each of which corresponds to a component of the face such as nose  eyes and mouth  and is programmed to detect the component in a given small area. the program works basically in a hierarchical top-down manner  in the sense that the ordinary order of calling routines into action is predetermined on the global-to-local basis. but i t s feature is that when something goes wrong  failure or inconsistent detection  within a routine  then the control goes back to former ones and retries them to correct or refine the parameters that might have caused the error. 
　　　a more complex control structure is mixture of bottom-up and top-down  and further middle-out  
 turner 1; popplestone  brown  ambler & crawford  1 . the ultimate style would be heterarchy  in which a number of modules work together like a community of experts with no s t r i c t central executive control winston 1 . however  it is very d i f f i c u l t to include the low-level processing in such a style of cooperation. though not heterarchy  the shirai's program 1  to obtain line drawings of polyhedra has embodied the most rich interactions between 
high-level and low-level routines. 	it is based upon the strategy of constructing a line drawing step by step. 	at each time the most probable line is hypothesized and verified by making use of previous results. 	recognition starts from 1  contour lines with a black background and goes into 1  other boundary lines between two bodies and 1  internal 
lines of bodies. 
1 	control structure 	for knowledge block representations 
　　　a control structure of the system that employs the knowledge block representations w i l l be discussed; it is again based on the control structure employed in sakai  kanade & ohta 1 . 
a  	each kb proposes i t s existence in its own way 
　　　it appears that the most crucial point is to know where in the image one should apply which object model. it is very natural to start with a part of the image where strong features exist; the result w i l l help in understanding other parts. but who knows what strong features are important  each object has i t s own cues at i t s own level of description  strong or weak. for example  in a city-outdoor scene  a light bluish patch in the upper part of the image suggests sky rather strongly. on the other hand  a brown patch suggests a wall of the brick building only very weakly. the evidence becomes stronger  if it has a linear boundary with the sky. it becomes much stronger if the patch together with neighboring patches forms a rectangular region with a regular substructure. what cues are used  what relations can support the evidence  and up to what level they are to be grouped  a l l these depend on each object. therefore rather than using a centralized hypothesizer  a distributed hypothesis-making is desirable. 
　　　the concept of the control structure is depicted in fig.1. as was mentioned in 1  the pool of plausible instances of processing-unit kbs and the i n i t i a l patch-level descriptions of image constitute the data base that represents the present state of image descriptions. each knowledge block looks at the data base. if it finds the cues  by ask rules   it begins its own processing and continues as far as it can  by select rules . if it checks that enough evidence has been found  by check rules    it proposes to add i t s instance  partial image description at that level  to the data base. thus the kbs work in parallel and communicate through the common data base. the blackboard model of control structure  erman& lesser 1  used in speech understanding provides a good metaphor at this point. 
　　　primitive functions for accessing the data base are prepared. the existential fetch; 
　ex-fetch  x  t specification of evaluation   is such a function. it selects from x  a l i s t of entities  one that satisfies the specified conditions 
more than t  and returns a pair of the entity and 
its evaluation value. 	for example  
ex-fetch  allp  1  
	' lamda  s  	 f-and  below s *rgn   dark s     . 
the evaluation is the value of fuzzy and of the two fuzzy predicates. allp is the reserved variable for a l l patches. *rgn is the unit itself that the kb using this ex-fetch represents. 
b  	proposal selection is necessary 
　　　it is apparent that if each kb is allowed to add i t s proposal to the common data base freely  the data base w i l l soon explode. some rating should be attached to the proposal. the simplest proposalselection mechanism selects an instance description 
with the highest rating at a time  and adds it to the common data base. the addition has two effects: 1  it may change the rating of instances of other kbs. each kb has a l i s t of kbs which refer to i t . 
thus what kbs have to recompute is known. the effect of recomputation may further propagate  repeatedly. 1  it may trigger the next-level kbs to propose the existence of their instances. 
　　　when a subimage instance is generated  the corresponding object description is inferred as a component of the scene description. now  following the model downward  the view of the object can be verified in the view description so far developed. the links l e f t incomplete in the various levels of instances  which may correspond to details of the 

	fig. 1 	concept of control structure for 
knowledge block representations 

fnvited papers-1: kanahe 1 

object  are completed  and the incorrect links which may have existed near the boundary are cut. instances that substantially overlap in the image with the verified one can be eliminated. 
　　　therefore  usually those objects which reveal their existence strongly  or which are not occluded by others  are processed f i r s t . if the image 
involves only weak occlusion and each object in it shows up clearly  a l l this w i l l suffice. this is actually what happens in shirai 1  for multipleobject recognition in the desk scene which includes a telephone  lamp  and bookstand. 
　　　much more sophisticated optimization mechanism would be possible and sometimes desirable barrow & tenenbaum 1 . however  the most important thing is to build up descriptions by basically datadriven analysis  so that the goal-directed  objectdependent analysis can be applied to an appropriate part of the image. 
c  	an example of occlusion inference 
　　　when an object is recognized and verified  i t s boundaries are checked. let us take a simple example. the boundaries may be divided into three parts: 
1  the boundary which shows the object's own shape or properties: for example  part of a linear boundary for a building or zig-zag boundary for a tree. it suggests the occluding boundary. 
1  contrarily  the boundary which shows the properties of the neighboring objects: it suggests the occluded boundary 1  not clear. 
the f i r s t and second evidences give some information about relative positions between parts of objects. in-front-of and behind-of pointers are added to the object-level description in order to give a partial ordering in depth. 
　　　in order to exploit this finding  the information is passed and added to the description of the corresponding patches; i.e.  what part of their boundary is occluding or occluded. a region instance  which has been suspended because part of the necessary area is not yet detected  can use this information as an excuse for that defect  and may 
raise i t s rating. the goal-directed process in the select rules can expand the region across the occluded boundary as if the expected conditions were satisfied. a simple method to transfer this effect to the next higher level description is to generate special  forgery  patches see fig.l  that have the desired properties  and link them to the region instance. 
d  	competing instances 
　　　although the instances kept in the common data base are the most plausible ones  they are not always correct in a l l details. 	the instance made in a later stage by the goal-directed procedure of the select rules may want to have a link to an entity to which another instance already has a link these are competing instances. 
　　　the problem of conflicting hypotheses is discussed in multi knowledge-source systems erman & lesser  1; barrow & tenenbaum  1 . the multicontext control is necessary. however  in image we can further take advantage of the local independence of parts of the image; i . e .   the fact that the influence of a decision at some local point often does not extend too far. unless the overlapping area is large  the competing instances can be treated as if both are correct at the same time. minor inconsistency of the context is not so serious. the number of contexts to be treated separatedly becomes smaller. 
　　　in the verification process  after one object is found  the part of the image in competition can be interpreted through negotiations among the competing units which have links to that part. this time the problem has become classification or comparison between them. 	usually it is easier and the results are more reliable. 
	v. 	role of low-level picture processing 
　　　one of the classical and somtimes misleading views about low-level processing is that it is information reduction process. this view leads to attempts to transform the input image directly into very compact  minimally sufficient form such as a line drawing. rather the low-level process should be viewed as information structuring process of raw image data  so that as much information as possible may become accessable from other knowledge sources. this alternative view leads us to regard the pixellevel image data plus various low-level picture-
processing functions as the structured data set that can answer questions from upper levels. this data set is the most basic part of the data base used in the image understanding process see fig.1 . 
1 	adequate descriptive vocabulary 
　　　in order that the structured data set works  adequate descriptive vocabulary is necessary to describe the image in terms of low-level entities. one basic attitude is to describe the cases which have been conventionally detected as a single yes/no event such as  an edge exists    and to have the next higher-level unit interpret the resultant description on a b i t more global basis. another point is to recognize that a large amount of computation is necessary to obtain adequate descriptions of the image with which to start the bottom-up  data-driven analysis; stinginess in description or computation is not to be pursued. 
　　　the primal sketch marr  1  is a rich symbolic description computed from the image  so that it can be the input of the next level. a typical feature description about edge at a point would be l i k e ; 
	  extended-edge 	 position 	 1   
	 contrast 	1  
                              orientation 1   fuzziness 1   . creating a primal sketch requires application of local f i l t e r s of various type  size and direction for each image point. 
　　　a simple working region-oriented technique is recursive thresholding technique by use of multiple histograms in order to partition the image into patches. this was f i r s t used by tomita  yachida & tsuji 1  in segmenting a textured scene. ohlander  1  used it in segmenting natural color scenes. 

fnvited papers-1: kanade 1 

       the method is very simple. f i r s t   c a l c u l a t e histograms of each of a v a i l a b l e l o c a l features of the image p o i n t . the features are such as i n t e n s i t y   component of c o l o r  red  green  hue  e t c .     g r a d i e n t   or occurrence of a l o c a l p a t t e r n . then s e l e c t a f e a t u r e whose histogram has two  or more  separated peaks; it means t h a t not a l l the image p o i n t s have s i m i l a r f e a t u r e values  but t h a t they form two  or more  groups. f i n a l l y threshold the image at the values which separate the peaks  and 
p a r t i t i o n the image i n t o several connected p a r t s . the sequence of these operations are applied recurs i v e l y to each of the r e s u l t a n t p a r t s   u n t i l each one has monopeak histograms f o r a l l the f e a t u r e s   which shows t h a t it is almost a homogeneous p a t c h . 
       the output product of t h i s r e g i o n - o r i e n t e d lowl e v e l processing is not again simply the segmented 
p i c t u r e . it consists of a l i s t of patches  a l i s t of boundaries  and a l i s t of v e r t i c e s   each of which includes t h e i r a t t r i b u t e s and l i n k s to represent t h e i r r e l a t i o n s . this does not necessarily mean t h a t a l l the values have been computed beforehand; it is too i n e f f i c i e n t . f a c i l i t i e s such as memo functions michie 1  are v a l u a b l e .

       this p r o p e r t y is r e l a t e d to the top-down aspect of c o n t r o l . the top-down analysis requests a lowl e v e l p i c t u r e processing program to v e r i f y or detect s p e c i f i c c o n d i t i o n s . this means t h a t the functions 
need to be programmed w i t h c o n t r o l l a b i l i t y so t h a t they can do as e x a c t l y much as the given guidance requests. a t y p i c a l example is found in s h i r a i ' s line f i n d e r   s h i r a i   1 1   . the c i r c u l a r search procedure is f o r searching f o r l i n e s s t a r t i n g at a given p o i n t when the d i r e c t i o n of the l i n e is not known. this problem is decomposed i n t o successive a p p l i c a t i o n s of the line-segment detection in poss i b l e d i r e c t i o n s . the d e t e c t i o n procedure is supposed to search  confirm or deny  a l i n e segment
