       considerable research has been devoted to the development of methods f o r reducing the transmission bandwidth of video s i g n a l s such that the r e constructed image is of a high q u a l i t y . t y p i c a l l y   these methods perform a s t a t i s t i c a l encoding of the i n t e n s i t y l e v e l s of a quantized p i c t u r e   or they perform some transformation and subsequent data reduction in order to achieve bandwidth reduct i o n   1   . such methods r a r e l y achieve data compression r a t i o s in excess of ten-to-one without noticeable loss of q u a l i t y in the reconstructed p i c t u r e . 
       in attempting bandwidth reductions of video s i g n a l s   very l i t t l e emphasis has been placed on the actual contents of the p i c t u r e . although methods have been i n v e s t i g a t e d f o r performing data compression by coding features e x t r a c t e d from d i g i t i z e d p i c t u r e s   they have not been very successful because of the f i d e l i t y c r i t e r i o n   1   . these methods have produced in some instances compressions of at best twenty-to-one. we f e e l that methods which e x t r a c t and encode features from the d i g i t i z e d p i c t u r e s can achieve compression r a t i o s in excess of 1 1 : 1 . furthermore  we f e e l that there are areas of a p p l i c a t i o n s in which the contents of the p i c t u r e is more important than i t s esthetic  q u a l i t y . in order to determine how pract i c a l t h i s viewpoint i s   we have performed p r e l i m i n a r y experiments on video data compression 
which encodes features e x t r a c t e d from d i g i t i z e d 
images. 
edge finding and encoding 
　　　the p i c t u r e s we compress are quantized to 1 l e v e l s . the edge f i n d i n g a l g o r i t h m used was designed to perform t h i n n i n g as it f i n d s the edge points so that the l i n e f o l l o w e r has s i n g l e p i x c e l l i n e s t o f o l l o w   1   . i n a d d i t i o n   the a l g o r i t h m averages out much of the i n f l u e n c e of the two l e v e l s of q u a n t i z a t i o n noise inherent in the v i s i o n system. the edge f o l l o w e r attempts to make as long a l i n e as possible by f i n d i n g edge p o i n t s which continue in the general d i r e c t i o n of a segment up to a distance of three p i x c e l s . 
　　　the encoding of these edge segments is achieved by approximating them w i t h s t r a i g h t l i n e segments   1     data compression is determined by c a l c u l a t i n g the r a t i o of the number of b i t s in the i n t e n s i t y array and the number of b i t s in the encoding. each p o i n t in the encoding needs 1 b i t s to represent i t : 1 b i t s f o r each of the x and y d i r e c t i o n s and a b i t to i n d i c a t e whether the point is an endpoint of i t s curve segment.

results 
　　　using a e r i a l photographs of the champaign county countryside p i c t u r e s were compressed and then reconstructed on a tektronix graphics d i s p l a y terminal   1   . the photographs were characterized by a preponderance of constant i n t e n s i t i e s 
w i t h many long boundaries between regions and many l o n g   s t r a i g h t and curving l i n e s . ratios in excess of 1 were achieved and the reconstructed p i c t u r e s appeared as l i n e drawings of the bounda r i e s of f i e l d s   highways and streams. man-made objects were the easiest things to recognize because t h e y   g e n e r a l l y have smooth-curved o u t l i n e s . 
       our r e s u l t s are very encouraging not only because we were able to achieve the r a t i o s hoped f o r   but also because there is considerable room to improve our system. in p a r t i c u l a r the edge f o l l o w i n g r o u t i n e can be changed from i t s present upward and l e f t bias to that of f o l l o w i n g a curve completely in the d i r e c t i o n it t r a v e l s   even when it i n t e r s e c t s another curve segment. secondly  the encoding a l g o r i t h m can be improved in at l e a s t two areas. it can use second order approximat i o n s to the curves and f u r t h e r encoding can be performed on the output of curve f i t t i n g r o u t i n e s . t h i r d l y   b e t t e r edge f i n d i n g routines can be found which achieve b e t t e r segmentations of the p i c t u r e thereby r e s u l t i n g in b e t t e r reconstructions of the p i c t u r e .
