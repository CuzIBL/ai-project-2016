1. introduction 
　　during the summer of 1 eighteen educators from throughout the united states joined with f i f t e e n nasa program engineers from six nasa centers to examine ways in which advanced automation  including a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e  ai  and r o b o t i c s   might be used in space missions in the next several decades. the study was supported by the national aeronautics and space administration  nasa  and the american society for engineering education  aser  because of an increasing r e a l i z a t i o n that advanced automatic and robotic devices must play a major role in space exploration and u t i l i z a t i o n   and may provide enormously b e n e f i c i a l c a p a b i l i t i e s at affordable cost. 
　　the 1-week  1-man-hour project was hosted by the university of santa clara and co-directed by james long and timothy healy. team members were given the task of selecting and defining a number of representative space ventures which would benef i t from or even require extensive application of 
machine i n t e l l i g e n c e and automation  and assessing e x i s t i n g and foreseeable ai technologies necessary to accomplish the proposed missions  long and healy  1 . major support in the f i e l d of a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e was provided by sri i n t e r n a t i o n a l   and a number of i n d u s t r i a l concerns made contributions in the area of system implementation. further  the study received f i r m backing from nasa headquarters 
personnel  including two unprecedented on-site personal v i s i t s by the agency administrator  dr. robert a. frosch. the strong nasa support signals a new perception of the tremendous potential of a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e in future space missions. 
　　for purposes of the summer study several specif i c areas w i t h i n ai were taken as representative of highly sophisticated computer-based systems which may be required in future space applications  i n cluding: planning and problem-solving; perception; natural languages; expert systems; automation  teleoperation  and r o b o t i c s ; d i s t r i b u t e d data management; and cognition and learning  aaai  1; arden  1; winston and brown  1 . the l a t t e r category includes the concept of an adaptive machine able to study a new s i t u a t i o n or environment  formulate hypotheses about the environment  test those hypotheses with additional data  and decide whether or not a new hypothesis should be added to the machine's e x i s t i n g model of the environment. the 1 study was predicated on the assumption that such machine c a p a b i l i t i e s w i l l become a v a i l able by the end of the present century. 
　　nasa has a long record of using automation and computers in i t s space missions. however  in 1 agency a c t i v i t i e s were examined by an ad hoc advisory committee and c r i t i c i z e d for being  1 to 1 years behind the leading edge in computer science and technology   sagan  1 . the committee also found that  the advances and developments in machine i n t e l l i g e n c e and robotics needed to make future space missions economical and feasible w i l l not happen without a major long-term commitment and c e n t r a l i z e d   coordinated support.  a part of nasa's response to t h i s c r i t i c i s m was to commission the university of santa clara study  the results of which are b r i e f l y described herein. 
1. mission descriptions 
　　the study group divided into four teams in order best to focus i t s examination of possible space app l i c a t i o n s of a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e . these teams were: t e r r e s t r i a l applications  space exploration  non-terrestrial u t i l i z a t i o n of materials  and replicating systems concepts. each team chose a challenging venture that could be used to i d e n t i f y c r i t i c a l technology needs for future research and development. a b r i e f description of each mission is given here. a far more complete discussion may be found in an extensive technical summary of the summer study  long and healy  1 . major c r i t e r i a for selection were that missions be implementable 
w i t h i n a few decades and that they demonstrate a 
s i g n i f i c a n t machine i n t e l l i g e n c e requirement. novelty was not considered to be a factor of primary importance. 
1 t e r r e s t r i a l applications: an i n t e l l i g e n t earthsensing information system 
　　the t e r r e s t r i a l applications team concluded that a r t i c i f i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e techniques would be most useful in near-earth missions which generate data 

1 

at very high rates - such as the tiros weather and landsat terrestrial imaging satellites. one of the weaknesses of such systems is that they tend to return far more data to earth than can ever be effectively used. the problem of culling a small amount of valuable information from a large volumne of useless data is a task now left largely to users. the 
team proposed a new  highly versatile intelligent earth sensing information system  iesis   able to perform substantial amounts of selection and interpretation of incoming sensor data and provide more useful information tailored to the needs of the individual user. a new philosophy of goal-oriented data collection  in which information is gathered to meet specific objectives  e.g.  site  observation timing  sensor sets   was articulated by the team as the cornerstone of the proposed mission. 
　　iesis has the following major features:  1  an intelligent satellite network which gathers data in a goal-directed manner  based on specific requests for observation  such as a farmer requesting oncea-week surveillance of his cornfield  and on prior knowledge contained in a detailed  self-correcting  world model ;  1  a user-oriented  natural language  interface which permits requests to be satisfied in plain english  without additional human intervention  using information retrieved from the system library or from direct observations made by a member satellite within the network;  1  a mediumlevel on-board decisionmaking capability that opti-
mizes sensor utilization without compromising user requests; and  1  a library of stored information which provides a detailed set of all significant planetary features and resources  adjustable for seasonal and other identifiable variations  and accessible through a comprehensive cross-referencing system. 
   the heart of iesis is  however  the world model  a self-correcting description of the environment under observation to any desired level of detail. this eliminates the need for acquiring and storing large quantities of redundant information by making use of two important ai elements: first  a  state component   which defines the physical state of the world to a predetermined accuracy and completeness at some specified time; and  second  a  theory component   which permits derivation of parameters of the world state not explicitly stored in the state component and allows forecasts of the time evolution of the state of the world. iesis retains the complete earth model in a ground-based central systems computer and an appropriate subset thereof onboard the main satellite. orbiter sensors s t i l l collect extensive data  but only changes in the world model are downlinked  rather than the entire data stream. the result is an effective data compression system which removes redundancy over time. 
1 space exploration: titan demonstration of a general-purpose exploratory system 
   nasa has been exploring the solar system for more than twenty years. such missions no doubt will continue in the decades ahead and may include visits to the more distant planets  moons  asteroids  comets and numerous yet-undiscovered bodies. it is conceivable that by the 1st century spacecraft may exit the solar system in search of other planetary systems many light-years from earth. the space exploration team thus identified interstellar navigation by automatic probe as an ultimate goal  but defined their overall study concept in terms of an autonomous general-purpose space exploration system. 
   one of the major problems with present interplanetary exploration strategies is that they typically require three distinct stages: initial reconnaissance  exploration  and intensive study. especially in the case of relatively distant bodies  the se-
quential character of the examination leads to inordinately lengthy total investigation times. the team concluded that the three stages can be telescoped into a single mission by incorporating advanced machine intelligence to produce a single integrated scientific phase of discovery. on-board ai systems are required to make certain initial decisions about sites to be explored in detail  the nature of the exploration  and the best ways to conduct intensive studies. 
   as a preliminary shakedown voyage for this new technology which could help pave the way for more ambitious exploratory ventures both within and beyond the solar system  the team proposed a demonstration mission to titan  the largest natural satellite of saturn . this would be capable of independent operation starting from launch in low earth orbit; navigation and propulsion system control during interplanetary transfer to saturn; rendezvous with titan and orbital insertion; auto-
matic landing site decision-making; deployment of various subsatellites  landers  and fliers on and about titan; and subsequent monitoring and control of atmospheric and surface exploration. 
   of course  decisions about succeeding steps in the exploration of titan could well be made directly by earth bound scientists since transmission 
delay time is only about one hour. 	however  when explorer craft are sent to other star systems the delay time will stretch to years  and decisions concerning successive stages of investigation must be made on-board the spacecraft. 	the purposes of the titan mission arc to enhance the capabilities of semi-autonomous vehicles in the short-term  and to refine and demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of fully autonomous exploration in the longterm. 
   a major finding of the study team was that automated hypothesis formation is highly desirable for sophisticated interplanetary missions within the solar system but is absolutely essential for interstellar exploration. machine intelligences capable of unassisted scientific and operational hypothesis formation must be able to handle three distinct classes of inferential thinking:  1  analytic inference  application of existing scientific classification schemes     1  inductive inference  logical processes for generating universal statements about an entire domain based on quantitative or symbolic information from a restricted part of that domain   and  1  abductive inference  a method for evolving new information classification schemes using old theories  old schemes  old predictions  and novel contradictory data as inputs . an important feature of the titan spacecraft is that it would carry a world model of the target for exploration  the best available record of all pertinent features of the body in view of the research to be conducted. the probe would use its sensors to accumulate data about titan  generate hypotheses about the sensed environ-

ment  test these hypotheses using new data  then update the scientific model as required. 
1 non-terrestrial utilization of materials: automated space manufacturing facility 
　　the non-terrestrial utilization of materials team studied the concept of a space manufacturing facili t y   i n i t i a l l y located in low earth orbit and using terrestrially-provided raw materials but constantly evolving towards ever-greater independence from earth resupply  miller and smith  1; sai  1 . this would be a permanent  fully automated or teleoperated facility ultimately for the utilization of non-terrestrial matter retrieved from asteroids  the moon  and other planets. extensive use of robotics and teleoperation techniques are required for e f f i cient manufacturing  repair  and for building new generations of equipment for expansion and diversification. automatic and robotic devices must be used to control processors  manipulate and transport components  organize fabrication  and generally perform a wide variety of typical manufacturing tasks. sophisticated new  telepresence   minsky  1  1  technology - full sensory feedback and effector control - might permit  say  an earth-based excavation or construction worker to drive a tractor on the moon from a comfortable terrestrial ground station or a command platform located in low earth orbit  leo . 
   such a mission requires important advances in visual  tactile  and force sensors  machine decisionmaking  adaptability  mobility  and many other areas of ai technology. rapid advancements now are being made in many of these fields in connection with the automation of factories on earth. it is  however  in nasa's interest to promote additional directed research into problems of manufacturing unique to the space environment. 
1 replicating systems concepts: self-replicating lunar factory and demonstration 
   someday it may become necessary to build very large  massive space structures - perhaps to erect 
huge observational platforms  mine and utilize significant quantities of lunar or asteroidal resources  tcrraform satellite or planetary environments  or harness the energy of the sun on a grand scale never before imagined. one way to build the large number of space factories needed to construct such systems rapidly is by the use of replicating systems. such systems may grow exponentially  producing great 
masses of organized matter in a relatively short period of time  freitas  1  1; von tiesenhausen and darbro  1 . 
   the replicating systems concepts team defined  as an ultimate challenge for advanced a r t i f i c i a l intelligence and automation  a factory on the moon 
which completely replicates itself using only lunar materials and solar energy. the basic concept of machine self-reproduction was shown theoretically feasible decades ago by john von neumann  1   but actual implementation will be extremely d i f f i c u l t . to arrive at a system capable of building all of its own components and then assembling them into an exact duplicate will require major advances in automated materials processing  computer-aided manufacturing and parts fabrication  cad/cam  technology   
1 
robot assembly techniques  storage and inventory maintenance  inspection and repair capabilities  scheduling and other aspects of general factory management requiring very sophisticated ai techniques . 
   the central theoretical issue is closure. can a real machine system itself produce and assemble all the kinds of parts of which it is comprised  in a generalized terrestrial industrialized economy manned by humans the answer clearly is yes  e.g.  american industry   since the set of machines which make all other machines is a subset of the set of all machines. in space a few percent of total system mass - in particular those items most difficult to produce such as ball bearings  motors  or integrated circuits - could feasibly be supplied from earth-based manufacturers as  vitamin parts.  alternatively  the system could be designed with components of very limited complexity  heer  1 . the minimum size of a self-sufficient  machine economy  remains unknown. 
1. artificial intelligence technology assessment 
   a principle goal of the summer study was to ident i f y advanced ai  robotics  and automation technology needs for mission capabilities representative of desired nasa programs in the 1 time period. six major classes of technology requirements derived during the mission definition phase of the project were identified as having maximum importance and urgency. these general classes of requirements individually were assessed by considering in each case the current state of the relevant technology; the specific technological goals to be achieved; and the developments needed to achieve these goals. 
1 	autonomous world model generation 
   perhaps the most important immediate requirement is the development of the technology necessary autonomously to map  manage  and re-instruct a world model based information system  at least a part of which is operating in space. research is needed generally in the following areas: 
 techniques for autonomous management of an intelligent space system. 
 mapping and modeling criteria for creation of compact world models. 
 autonomous mapping from orbital imager. 
 efficient  rapid image processing based on comparisons with world model information. 
 advanced pattern recognition  signature analysis algorithms and multisensor data/knowledge fusion. 
 explicit models of system users. 
 fast  high-density computer systems suitable for space application of world model computations and 
processing. 
1 	machine learning and hypothesis formation 
   learning  the process at the heart of the problem of developing  intelligent machines   is afield 
of ai requiring major research for space applications. more work is needed to develop the theoretical basis of machine learning  to identify which operations are essential to learning  and to deter-

mine how these functions might be implemented in hardware. a machine i n t e l l i g e n c e which learns must be capable of  1  formulating hypotheses which apply e x i s t i n g concepts to events and processes found in a new environment  analytic inference   and of  1  hypothesizing new concepts  laws and theories whenever e x i s t i n g ones are inadequate  inductive and abductive inferences . 
　　analytic inferences have received the most complete treatment w i t h i n the al research community. for example  rule-based expert systems can apply detailed diagnostic c l a s s i f i c a t i o n schemes to data on events and processes in some given domain and produce appropriate i d e n t i f i c a t i o n s . however  these consist solely of complex diagnostic rules describing the phenomena in some domain. they do not i n -
clude models of the underlying physical processes of these phenomena. in general  s t a t e - o f - t h e - a r t ai treatments of analytic inference f a i l to l i n k detailed c l a s s i f i c a t i o n schemes with fundamental models required to deploy t h i s detailed knowledge with maximal e f f i c i e n c y . 
　　inductive inferences receive a less complete treatment than analytic inferences  although some s i g n i f i c a n t advances have been made. for instance  a group at the czechoslovak academy of sciences has developed formal techniques for moving from data about a r e s t r i c t e d number of members of a domain  to observation statement s  which summarize the main features or trends of t h i s data  to a t h e o r e t i c a l statement which asserts that an abstractive feature or mathematical function holds for a l l members of the domain  hajek and havranek  1 . another research e f f o r t attempts to integrate fundamental 
models with specific a b s t r a c t i v e   or generalizing  techniques. however  t h i s work is at the level of theory development - a working system has yet to be implemented in hardware. 
　　abductive inference has scarcely been touched by the ai community. tentative f i r s t steps have been taken  as for example current e f f o r t s in  non-monotonic l o g i c   presented at a recent ai conference held at stanford university   i s r a e l   1; weyrauch et  a l .   1 . these attempts to deal with the i n vention of new or revised knowledge structures are hampered  and f i n a l l y undermined  by t h e i r lack of a general theory of abductive inference. one notable exception is the recent work of frederick hayes-roth 
 1   who takes a theory of abduction developed by imre lakatos for mathematical discovery and operat i o n a l izes two low-level members of lakatos' family of abductive i n f e r e n t i a l types. s t i l l   t h i s work is but a preliminary step toward the implementation of workable systems of mechanized abduction. 
1 natural language and other man-machine communication 
　　if earth-sensing systems and remotely operated devices are to be used by a wide range of r e l a t i v e ly unsophisticated users  substantial improvements are necessary in man-machine communication. this includes the development of high-level natural languages  machine generation and recognition of speech  visual perception and image generation. 
　　in those instances in which the environment is highly r e s t r i c t e d with respect to both the domain of discourse  semantics  and the form of appropriate statements  syntax   serviceable interfaces are j u s t possible with s t a t e - o f - t h e - a r t techniques. however  any s i g n i f i c a n t relaxation of semantic and syntactic constraints produces very d i f f i c u l t problems in a i . for general use the following c a p a b i l i t i e s are highly d e s i r a b l e   and probably necessary  for e f f i c i e n t and e f f e c t i v e communic a t i o n : domain model  user model   general  i d i o syncratic  contextual   dialogue model  explanatory c a p a b i l i t y   and reasonable default assumot i o n s . 
　　recognition and understanding of fluent spoken language adds f u r t h e r complexity to that of ordinary 
keyed language/phoneme ambiguity. in noise-free environments involving r e s t r i c t e d vocabularies  it is possible to achieve r e l a t i v e l y high recognition accuracy  though presently not in real time. in more r e a l i s t i c operating scenarios  oral fluency and recognition divorced from semantic understanding is not l i k e l y to succeed. the c r i t i c a l need is the coupling of a l i n g u i s t i c understanding system to the spoken natural language recognition process. on a related research f r o n t   the physical aspects of machine speech generation are ready for applicat i o n s   although some additional  cosmetic  work is s t i l l necessary for general use. 
　　some motor-oriented transfer of information from humans to machines already has found l i m i t e d use  such as l i g h t pens  j o y s t i c k s   and head-eye p o s i t i o n detectors employed for m i l i t a r y target acquis i t i o n . an i n t e r e s t i n g a l t e r n a t i v e for space a p p l i cations is the  show and t e l l   approach. in t h i s method a human manipulates an iconic model of the real environment. a robot  watches  these actions  perhaps complemented by some f u r t h e r information spoken by the human operator   then duplicates them in the real environment. robot action need not be real time with respect to human operator action the machine may analyze the overall p l a n   ask quest i o n s   and cooperatively optimize the o r i g i n a l course of a c t i o n . the operator plays the role of   e d i t o r   of the evolving robot program. show and t e l l tasks can be constructed piecemeal  thus allowing a job to be described to the machine which re-
quires many simultaneous and coordinated events. f i n a l l y   the f i d e l i t y of robot actions to the human example may vary in s i g n i f i c a n t ways   e . g .   size scale  mass scale  or speed of performance   allowing the machine to optimize the task in a manner a l i e n to human t h i n k i n g . 
1 	space manufacturing automation 
　　to achieve the goals of space manufacturing and r e p l i c a t i v e automation  space processing l i k e l y must progress from t e r r e s t r i a l simulations to low earth o r b i t experimentation with space production techniques  and u l t i m a t e l y to processing lunar mat e r i a l s and other n o n - t e r r e s t r i a l resources into feedstock for more basic product development. there are four major components of any   u n i v e r s a l   manufacturing system:  1  extraction and p u r i f i c a t i o n of useful materials from raw resources   1  f a b r i cation of product components   1  product component assembly  and  1  system c o n t r o l . 
　　extraction and p u r i f i c a t i o n technologies for processing raw materials on the lunar surface or elsewhere l i e far beyond s t a t e - o f - t h e - a r t . sophist i c a t e d   highly automated chemical  e l e c t r i c a l   and c r y s t a l l i z a t i o n techniques must be developed y i e l d -

1 

ing a far broader range of elements and materials than is presently possible. product component fabr i c a t i o n involves primary shaping and f i n i s h i n g operations. shaping technologies of greatest u t i l i t y for f u l l y automatic space manufacturing are casting and powder metallurgy  both of which can produce parts ready for use without further processing. elimination of manual mold preparation should be sought  possibly through the use of computer-cont r o l l e d containerless forming. laser and electronbeam techniques appear promising for highly automated f i n i s h i n g . product component assembly requires robot/teleoperator v i s i o n and end-effectors which are smart  s e l f - p r e s e r v i n g   and dexterous. placement accuracy of l/1th inch and r e p e a t a b i l i t y of 1 1ths inch are desirable in electronics assembly tasks. high-capacity arms and multi-arm coordination must be developed. 
　　control of a large-scale space manufacturing or r e p l i c a t i n g system demands a d i s t r i b u t e d   h i e r a r c h i a l   dynamic  machine-intelligent information system. for inventory c o n t r o l   an automated storage and r e t r i e v a l system w e l l - s u i t e d to the space environment is necessary. the a b i l i t y to gauge and measure products inspection or q u a l i t y control - is e s s e n t i a l   and a general-purpose high-resolution ai v i s i o n module is needed for q u a l i t y control of complex products and components. advances in a r t i f i c i a l intelligence should also include the embodiment of managerial and repair s k i l l s in an autonomous  adaptive-control expert system. 
1 	teleoperators and robot systems 
　　teleoperators permit action or observation at a distance by human operators. teleoperation represents a technology intermediate between f u l l y manned and autonomous robot a c t i v i t y   having motor functions  commanded by the man  with many possible c a p a b i l i t i e s and sensors  possibly m u l t i p l e   special-purpose  to supply information. the human being controls and supervises through a mechanical or computer i n t e r face. as technology advances and new requirements emerge  more and more of command/control functions must reside in the computer with the man assuming a more supervisory r o l e . with the development of superior al methods  computers eventually may perform  mental  functions of far greater complexity  eventually becoming v i r t u a l l y autonomous. 
　　an important goal of teleoperator development must be to give the operator the a b i l i t y to sense remote environments as r e a l i s t i c a l l y as possible  an effect termed  telepresence  by minsky  1  1 . the capacity closely to r e l a t e action and reaction at the remote s i t e and at the control room requires major advances in manipulators  coordinat i o n and cooperation of multiple manipulator arms and hands ; force r e f l e c t i o n and servoing; v i s u a l   audio  t a c t i l e   radar/proximity and other sensors; comprehension of variable conditions of scene i l l u mination  wide or narrow viewing f i e l d s   and threedimensional information via stereo displays  planar beams  or holograms; and systems to circumvent the d i s o r i e n t i n g effects of communication time delays in sensor/effector feedback loops. 
　　two other d i s t i n c t classes of teleoperators may be required for complex  large-scale space operations such as a manufacturing f a c i l i t y or r e p l i c a t ing f a c t o r y . f i r s t is a f r e e - f l y i n g system combin-
1 
ing the technology of the man maneuvering unit with the safety and v e r s a t i l i t y of remote manipulation. the f r e e - f l y i n g teleoperator can be used for s a t e l l i t e s e r v i c i n g   s t o c k p i l i n g and handling materials  
operations requiring autonomous rendezvous  s t a t i o n keeping  and docking c a p a b i l i t i e s . second  mobile or walking teleoperators may be useful in various manufacturing processes and for handling hazardous materials. the device would automatically move to a designated i n t e r n a l or external work s i t e and perform either preprogrammed or remotely controlled functions. for manufacturing and repair such a system could transport astronauts to the s i t e . manipulators could be l o c a l l y controlled for view/clamp/ tool operations or as a mobile workbench. 
1 	computer science and technology 
　　nasa's r o l e   both now and in the f u t u r e   is fundamentally one of information  a c q u i s i t i o n   processi n g   analysis  and dissemination. this requires a strong i n s t i t u t i o n a l expertise in computer science and technology. general computer science research avenues and c a p a b i l i t i e s required to implement the types of missions proposed by the study teams i n clude: computer systems  software  management serv i c e s   and computer systems engineering. state-ofthe-art technology already is a part of nasa programs in the natural sciences  engineering  simulat i o n and modeling. a substantial commitment to r e search in machine i n t e l l i g e n c e   real time systems  information r e t r i e v a l   supervisory and computer systems is required. 
1. conclusions and recommendations 
　　advanced machine technology is essential in real i z i n g a major space program c a p a b i l i t y for extra-
t e r r e s t r i a l exploration and resource u t i l i z a t i o n w i t h i n r e a l i s t i c temporal and economic l i m i t s . to t h i s end  the study group reached the following general conclusions and recommendations: 
 1  machine i n t e l l i g e n c e systems with automatic hypothesis formation capacity are necessary for autonomous examination of unknown environments. this c a p a b i l i t y is highly desirable for e f f i cient exploration of the solar system and is essential for the ultimate investigation of other star systems. 
 1  the development of e f f i c i e n t models of earth phenomena and t h e i r incorporation into a world model based information system are required for a p r a c t i c a l   user-oriented  earth resource observation network. 
 1  a permanent manned f a c i l i t y in low earth o r b i t is an important element of a future space program. planning for such a f a c i l i t y should provide for a s i g n i f i c a n t automated space manufact u r i n g c a p a b i l i t y . 
 1  new  automated space materials processing techniques must be developed to provide long-term space manufacturing capacity without major cont i n u i n g dependence on earth resupply. 
 1  replication of complex space manufacturing faci l i t i e s is a long-range need for ultimate largescale space u t i l i z a t i o n . a program to develop 
and demonstrate major elements of t h i s capabili t y should be undertaken. 
 1  general and special purpose teleoperator/robot systems are required for a number of manufacturi n g   assembly  inspection and repair tasks. 
 1  an aggressive nasa development commitment in computer science is fundamental to the acquisi t i o n of machine intelligence/automation expert i s e and technology required for the mission c a p a b i l i t i e s described e a r l i e r . this should include a program for increasing the number of 
people trained in the relevant f i e l d s of computer science and a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e .
