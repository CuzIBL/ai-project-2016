       a web grammar w i l l be called contextsensitive  -free  i f a l l i t s rewriting rules are context-sensitive  -free . the simple example of a web grammar which was given above is context-free  since only one-point webs are r e w r i t t e n . other examples of both context-free and contextsensitive web grammars w i l l be given in the next two sections. 
　　　　it is i n s t r u c t i v e to compare our d e f i n i t i o n of a web grammar with the d e f i n i t i o n of a  plex grammar  given by 
feder1. 	we can think of feder's napes 
   n-attaching-point e n t i t i e s     as webs in which one point is labelled with the name of the nape  and the others with the i d e n t i f i e r s of i t s attaching points. feder's   j o i n t l i s t s     which describe how sets of napes are interconnected  correpond to the edges  which need not be directed  internal to the subwebs a and 1 in a web rewriting r u l e ; while his   t i e 
point l i s t   corresponds to the embedding e of b in the host web.  he also makes use of a   t i e point l i s t   for a  so that he can allow the rewriting rule to be applied only if the edges between a and the host web satisfy given conditions.  feder's system can be regarded as a generalization of shaw's   e . g .   1   ; shaw deals only with e n t i t i e s having just two attaching points   head  and   t a i l     . thus the web grammars defined in t h i s paper - if t h e i r webs are regarded as embedded in the plane - can be thought of as equivalent to a general class of  picture grammars . 
examples of context-free web languages: 
trees and two-terminal 
series-parallel networks 
　　　in this section we give context-free graph grammars for two important classes of directed graphs: directed trees with least points  and directed two-terminal s e r i e s - p a r a l l e l networks  without multiple edges   

proof; we f i r s t verify that the webs generated by this grammar a l l have least point and a l l have one fewer edges than points. this is cleat if the i n i t i a l web was a   since none of the rules apply to i t . similarly  the i n i t i a l web a. a has these properties; 
we proceed by induction on the number of times that the rules are applied to i t . readily  under any application of a r u l e   the  a  in the i n i t i a l web remains the least point  since if there was a path from it to every point before 
the rule was applied  the d e f i n i t i o n of the embedding insures that there is s t i l l a path from it to every point afterwards. f i n a l l y   i t i s easily v e r i f i e d that each rule always adds the same number of edges as it does points  so that the former number always r e mains one less than the l a t t e r . 

　　　by a directed tree is meant a connected directed graph whose number of edges is just one less than i t s number of points. it can be shown that a directed graph with least point is a directed tree if and only if there is a unique path from the least point to each point. 
　　　conversely  we shall show that any directed tree g with least point can be generated by the grammar. note f i r s t that in any such g  if t is a point such that the path from the least point to t is as long as possible  then t is maximal  so that g always has a maximal point. we shall show that  given any
