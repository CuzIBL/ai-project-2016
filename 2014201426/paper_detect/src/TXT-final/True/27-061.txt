 
an approach to nonmonotonic inference based on a closure operation on a conditional knowledge base is presented the central idea is that  given a theory of default conditionals  an extension to the theory le defined that satisfies certain intuitive restrictions two notions for forming an extension are given  corresponding to the incorporation of irrelevant properties in conditionals and of transitivity among condi tionals  in this approach these notions coincide several equivalent definitions for an extension are developed general nonconstructive definitions  and a general  pseudo-iterative  definition reasoning with irrelevant properties is correctly handled  as is specificity  reasoning within exceptional circumstances  and inheritance reasoning tina approach is intented to ultimately serve as the proof-theoretic analogue to an extant semantic development based on preference orderings among possible worlds

a continuing problem in artificial intelligence is dealing with general  generic sentences that admit exceptions for example  suppose we are given that birds fly birds have wings  penguins are birds  and penguins don't fly we can write this in a propositional gloss1 as 
		 1  
in nonmonotonic reasoning with such statements there are several principles that one would want to hold ac cording to the principle of specificity  a more specific default should apply over a less specific default thus given that p is true  we would want to conclude - f by default  
since being a penguin is a more specific notion than that of being a bird second  one should obtain transitivity of default conditionals  or inheritance of properties by default so  given that p is true  one would also want to conclude by default that w was true  and so penguins 
     1 that is to say we will eventually have to deal with firstorder issues but do not do so here for this paper b =  f can be given the reading  if x-is-a-bird then normally x-flies  
1 	non m1t1nic reasoning have wings by virtue of being birds third  irrelevant properties should be properly handled and so  all other things being equal  we would want to conclude that a green bird flies fourth  one should be able to reason in the presence of exceptions  and so given that b  ~ f was true one would still conclude that w was true 
　it has proven difficult to specify an approach that achieves all of these properties earlier systems  such as circumscription and default logic  provide accounts of general mechanisms for nonmonotonic inference that generally handle inheritance and relevance well  but do not deal with specificity rather it is up to the user to hand-code specificity information for example in the naive representation of the above example in default logic  if p is true we obtain a set of default conclusions in which - f is true and another bet in which f is true 
　rpcently much attention has been paid to conditional systems of default inferencing the starting point here is not so much to provide a general mechanism for nonmonotonic inference  as it is to provide a theory of some phenomenon  based on intuitions concerning  for example  possibility exceptionalness  or nonmonotonic consequence operators the initial systems were  on the whole  quite weak  subsequent work has focussed on means to extend the system's basic inferences as discussed in the next section  while these systems generally handle specificity well  none satisfactorily handles all of inheritance  relevance  and reasoning in exceptional circumstances 
　this paper explores approaches to syntactically closing off a conditional knowledge base the idea is to formalise directly notions corresponding to the incorporation of irrelevant properties and  separately  to the inheritance of properties essentially then  proof-theoretic  approaches to default reasoning are investigated  based on intuitions regarding desirable properties for a nonmonotonic reasoning system i begin with a specific conditional logic capable of expressing relations among defaults so  given our initial example  we can derive the fact that birds are normally not penguins    e b = - p  this logic however does not address the problems of irrelevant properties or inheritance thus we cannot conclude that a green bird flies  nor that a penguin has wings by  transitivity  we address this by defining an extension of a theory  or a plausible  extended  default theory in the first place  an extension includes condi-

tionals incorporating irrelevant properties in the second place  an extension includes conditionals obtained from  default  transitivities among conditionals  and so accounts for inheritance 
　the appropriateness of the approach is argued in a number of ways first  the approach formalises plausible  familiar intuitions concerning properties of default inference second  various canonical and non-canonical examples are shown to be appropriately handled here third  it proves to be the case that incorporating irrelevant properties corresponds exactly to incorporating transitivity of conditionals hence the same  nonmonotonic  phenomenon underlies these seemingly distinct notions the approach then is of independent interest  nonetheless  it is intended ultimately to serve as a proof-theoretic analogue to an extant semantic approach  based on preference orderings among possible worlds the next section discusses related work in section 1 the logic of defaults on which the present approach is based is presented section 1 gives the formal details of the approach this is followed by a discussion and a concluding section proofs of theorems and further details are found in  delgrande  1  
1 	background 
related work many of the earlier systems of default reasoning deal with mechanisms for effecting nonmonotonic reasoning autoepistemic logic  moore  1   circumscription  mccarthy  1   default logic  reiter  1   and  for our purposes. theorist  poole  1  are examples of such approaches in this group  issues of specificity are not addressed within the system  although other properties such as inheritance  are ade quately handled various modifications have been proposed to handle specificity in these systems but these modifications are build on top of the system without a formal theory  it is not clear if such modifications are appropriate or in any sense complete since defaults per se are not part of the formal system one also cannot reason about defaults thus  one could not conclude from our initial example that birds are normally not penguins 
　recently  much attention has been paid to conditional systems of default inferencing such systems address specific forms of nonmonotonic inference  or deal with specific defeasible conditionals based  for example  on notions of preference or exceptionalness there has been a remarkable convergence or agreement on what constitutes a core set of inferences that ought to be common to all nonmonotonic systems systems such as ententailment  pearl  1   or 1-entailment or p-entailment  adams  1    possibihstic logic  dubois and prade 
1   preferential entailment  kraus et al  1   and cta  boutiher  1   among others  essentially allow the same inferences  and may be taken as specifying a conservative core  pearl  1  that ought to be common to all nonmonotonic inference systems these approaches deal satisfactorily with specificity however  not unexpectedly  they are much too weak in particular  relevance and inheritance of properties are not handled hence  even though a bird may be assumed to fly by default  a green bird cannot be assumed to fly by default  since there may be models of a theory where a 
green bird does not fly  
　equally surprising  there has also been a strong convergence on a means of strengthening these systems approaches including system z and 1-entailment  pearl  1   co'  boutilier. 1   possibilistic entailment  benferhat et al  1   and rational closure  kraus et al  1  all assume  in a semantic sense  that a world is as unexceptional as possible thus essentially  since there is no reason to suppose that greenness has any bearing on flight  one assumes that greenness has no effect on flight while this assumption seems reasonable enough  its realisation in these systems is not unproblematic  as described below in brief these approaches fail to allow full inheritance of properties  as well they allow unwanted specificity relations in the next subsection  system z is described as a represent ative of these approaches these approaches have been extended in various wavs  including  goldszmidt and pearl  1  goldszmidt et al  1  benferhat et al  1  howevtr these extensions allow the unwanted specificities found in the original approaches  
　of other work   delgrande  1  gives an iterative strengthening of defaults using met a-theoretic assumptions however  since it provides an iterative procedure for strengthening it is difficult to formally characterise the set of default inferences this approach is strictly subsumed by the first approach described here  geffner and pearl  1  presents another strengthening of the above-mentioned systems called conditional entailment there are two difficulties with this approach first  it is quite complex in its formulation and  second  it does not sanction full inheritance of default properties

1 	discussion 
comparison with related work the technical development of the last section is somewhat reminiscent of that of default logic  reiter  1   and it is worthwhile outlining the similarities and differences in default logic  dl  a default theory is given by a pair  d w  where d is a set of default rules  expressed as domain-specific  rules of inference   and w is a set of classical  first-order or propositional  formulas  giving information about the domain at hand an extension is a maximal acceptable set of beliefs  obtained by  applying  as many rules from d  given w  as possible an extension then is a superset of w 
　in our case the object is to extend the set of default conditionals  in dl this would correspond to augmenting d an extension in the present approach then is intended to be  applicable' to any domain of application  1 e to any  w   
　in both approaches three properties are given that can be expected to hold for any extension 
1 the thing extended  w in dl  t here  should he contained in an extension 
1 the extension should be deductively closed 
1 as many  rules  as possible should be applied or added 
in both cases a nonconstructive definition of an exten won is given the present approach does not require a fixed-point definition as dl does  roughly  due to the comparatively restricted form of the conditional defaults 
　with respect to more recent and more closely-related work  the present approach can be compared to ap proaches exemplified by system z  pearl  1 as mentioned in section 1  there arc two weaknesses with these systems one cannot inherit properties across exceptional subclasses  and undesirable specificities  are sometimes obtained the first difficulty has been rectified in  for example  benferhat et al  1  however since this system subsumes system z the second problem remains the difficulty here  and the difference with the approach at hand  is that system z assumes that things are as  unexceptional'  l e ranked as low  as consistently possible hence for our birds and penguins example  any irrelevant conditional  e g  students like cheap but good restaurants''  is ranked at level 1  and consequently lower than any conditional involving penguins this  as described previously  leads to undesirable specificities in the approach at hand  unrelated conditionals remain unrelated and so there are no direct inferences between penguins and students 
　as mentioned  the approach of strengthening presented here strictly subsumes one of the approaches given in  delgrande  1   where an iterative means of augmenting a theory is given 
	1'recall from section 	1 that systems such as co  
 boutiher 1  possibilistic entailment  benferhat el al  1   or rational closure  lehmann and magidor  1  are essentially equivalent with respect to derivability 
further work there are two major areas for further work the first concerns a semantics for the approach  while the second deals with implementation issues 
　the assertion was made at the outset that this approach is of independent interest nonetheless  it has been formulated with a specific semantic development in mind  delgrande  1  in this latter development  a conditional in a theory t prefers a world in which the classical counterpart of the conditional is true  over a world in which it is false that is  b f prefers a 
　world in which b  f is true over one in which is true following on this intuition  a set of conditionals t determines an ordering  or ordenngs  on a set of possible worlds in this approach  1 follows by default from ct just if b is lrue in the most preferred worlds in which ft is true it is conjectured that these approaches are equivalent they were formulated with this equivalence in mind but it remains to be shown that they are equivalent 
　with respect to implementation concerns  although the definitions for an extension involve the addition of an infinite number of defaults  it is clear that an implementation would not need to contend with the full set of defaults in an extension 1 rather  in determining whether alpha  -1- b given a theorem prover for the logic  see  lamarre 1  for example   the issue is to find a set of supported conditionals which when added to t allows or =  1 to be derived second  we might expect that when the form of sentences in a theory is appropriately restricted  say  to something looking like horn clauses  we would obtain good complexity results

this paper has presented an approach for extending a default theory so as to obtain a system for default inferencing via the incorporation of irrelevant properties or inheritance of properties the approach takes as a 
starting point an extant  monotonic  logic of defaults from this  given a default theory  definitions for an ex tension were given corresponding to intuitions regarding irrelevant properties and inheritance of properties in addition to the logic of defaults described in section 1  the results of this paper apply also to the  conservative core  for default inferences arguably the notion of an extension satisfactorily formalises intuitions concern ing augmenting a default theory that the approach captures a reasonable notion of  extension' is also supported by the fact that the concepts of irrelevance and inheritance prove to be interdefinable the approach also handles standard and non-standard examples of default reasoning  and avoids the difficulties encountered by other approaches finally  it is conjectured that an extant semantic approach is equivalent to the present work 
　the approach is intended to be applicable to defeasible conditionals  or to generic sentences which allow possible exceptions consequently it will not be  nor 
　　t any more so than in classical logic  in determining whether t i- o  one would first  form the deductive closure of 

is it intended to be  applicable in all areas for example  in this approach defaults are implicitly  applied  
wherever possible 	consequently  given a chain of de-
faults 
lacking contradictory information we would obtain that 
 this may be fine for default reasoning  but it leads to unintuitive results for temporal reasoning  as has been noted for example for chronological ignorance hence the present approach would appear to produce results too strong for such reasoning 
　there are two principal areas for further work first a provably equivalent semantics  presumably based on preference orderings among worlds  is obviously desirable second  computational concerns have not been addressed however the immediate goal of this paper has been to characterisation proof-theoretic approaches to default inference given this  computational issues can subsequently be addressed
