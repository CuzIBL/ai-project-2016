introduction 
     this paper introduces a control method based on knowledge s t r u c t u r e s . the concept of agenda has been successfully applied to the expert systems by several authors   1     1     1     1     1     the general agenda method used so far has some drawbacks: 
* the e f f i c i e n c y is low as the system is com-plex. 
* the formation of tasks is complicate. 
* the 	formation 	of reasons 	is 	d i f f i c u l t . 
the concept introduced in t h i s paper is to attempt to overcome some of those drawbacks  especially the e f f i c i e n c y . the essential points of our concept are: 
* we t r e a t the reasoning process as a series of s e l e c t i o n   e v a l u a t i o n   and generation of tasks. this is the same as in the ordinary agenda methods. 
* the tasks in the agenda are organized h i e r a r -c h i c a l l y corresponding to the s t r u c t u r e of 
knowledge  such t h a t   in general  only tasks in the same l e v e l are allowed to compote with each other. 
* there are some key tasks which have the highest p r i o r i t y   so that when one of them appears in the agenda  t h i s task w i l l be evaluated immed i a t e l y . 
this control strategy is applied to a medical d i a g nosis expert system mdm with success 1 . the sys-
tem is implemented on univac 1. 
structure of tasks 
     system mdm has a h i e r a r c h i c a l s t r u c t u r e of knowledge. the form of it is course . frame . slot.

the f i r s t level knowledge is course. different courses may be defined by peoples with different expertise. the second level knowledge is frame  which are units of knowledge of the course correspondingly. the third level knowledge is slot  which are the properties of the corresponding frame. the set of slots of each frame is fixed for simplifying the treatment. 
     the structure of tasks corresponds to the structure of knowledge. the general form of the task i s : 
course x .frame y .slot z .operation w .  
where x  y  	z  	w are v a r i a b l e s . 	for tasks of d i f -
f e r e n t l e v e l s   	the corresponding forms are: 
course x .operation w . 
course x .frame y .operation w . 
course x .frame y .slot z .operation w .  
operation consists of three elements  they are: 
check: to check the content of the task  and see whether it is necessary to evaluate further. 
evaluation: to evaluate. 
     dicision: according to the result obtained  decide the inference direction. as an example  
course a .frame b .slot caused-by .check. 
is a task which means to see whether the cause of desease of frame b in course a is necessary to be evaluated. 
     besides  there are two special tasks which are used frequently. one is 
test x   
which asks to conduct some experimental t e s t   and x is the t i t l e   e . g .   wbc. the other one is 
course x .frame y .count.  
which performs the c a l c u l a t i o n of r e l i a b i l i t y f o r the r e s u l t obtained by the proceeding tasks so f a r   and the r e s u l t a n t should be r e t u r n e d .

heuristic rules 	then: evaluate xi. . 

     there are two categories of heuristic rules in system mdm: 
* the rules that are subordinate to tasks: when a task is being evaluated  rules are selected according to the environment  and i t s reasoning conclusion is the operation result of the task. e.g.  
if: 1  it is necessary to evaluate the cause of the desease  which is represented by an instance of a frame  and 
       1  this instance- i .  not confirmative  then: generate tasks: 
1  course.frame.caused-by.eval.  1  course.frame. check. 
this rule is attached to the task 
course x  .frame y  . slot   caused-r;y  .check. 
as another example  a rule may form the judgement on the instance of a frame as reliable  unreliable  or the case in between. 
if: 1  the score of a frame is below the threshold  
1  a l l the contents in slot dg1 are unreliable  
then: this frame is reliable. 
* the rules which are subordinate to the system: which are devided into several groups  such as: 
** i n i t i a t i o n rules  
** rules for inheritence  ** rules that generate reasons  ** rules that generate tasks  etc.. 
the meaning of these rules will be given in the succeeding sections. 
dispatching tasks 
     when using ordinary method  a l l tasks put in the agenda compete with each other. the one with highest priority is to be selected and evaluated. the heuristic rule for the corresponding control is as: 
if: 1  there are some tasks in the agenda whose priority values are above the threshold  and 
       1  x i is the task with highest priority  then: evaluate xi. 
the control mechanism of our system is somewhat different. that i s   it controls in a hierarchical way. the corresponding rule i s : 
if: 1  there is no key task in the agenda  and 
1  at the moment  there are executable tasks in several levels of agenda  among which  the n t h level is with the highest priority  
1  xi is the task in n 	level with highest priority  
the priorities of different levels of the agenda are given a p r i o r i   such that  level-1 with highest value  and level-1  the lowest. 
     in general  there is no competition between tasks in difference levels. the advantages of this strategy are obvious. in short  
* the efficiency of search is increased  
* the formation of reasons is simplified  
* the aims of competition between tasks are more clear. 
     there are some key tasks involved in the system  which are generated by some heuristic rules. when the key task appears in the agenda  it w i l l be evaluated immediately without exception. one of 
the purposes of introducing these key tasks is to establish the connections of tasks between different agenda levels. at critical moment  the key task w i l l change the direction of control of the whole operation. 
there are two categories of key tasks: 
* when a task has been evaluated  the resultant may transfer some tasks to be the key tasks  
e.g.   
if: a frame or a course is confirmed  
then: the decision task related to this frame or course is a key task. 
* all tasks in the agenda are with their p r i -orities below the threshold  but there might be some tasks  the evaluation of which w i l l influence the final results of the operation. these tasks are assigned to be the key tasks. 
e.g.  
if: 1  in agenda  there is no task whose p r i ority is above the threshold  
1  there is s t i l l a decision task in the agenda  
then: this task is a key task. 
     we treat the reasoning process as a series of selection  evaluation  and generation of tasks. each level of the agenda maintains a high threshold value. the condition for evaluating a task is that i t s priority is over this threshold. it also maintains a low threshold value. the condition for generating a new task is the score of i t s i n i t i a l reason being over this threshold. 
reasons for tasks 
     there are two categories of reasons formed in the system: 
* reasons formed in the new task as it is generated  e.g.  
if: the new task evaluation is generated from the task check  
	then: add reason to the new task 	1 

1 	c. lou and j. wang 
* reasons caused by the environment  e . g .   
i f : 1  in test  tasks with r i s k equal to zero are a l l evaluated  
1  the instance of frame x  is not a f f i r m a t i v e   
1  there is s t i l l a caused-by task in the agenda  
	then: add reason to the task caused-by 	1. 
the summation of the values of d i f f e r e n t reasons of a task is the t o t a l score of that task. 
inheritance of deduction information 
     after the e v a l u a t i o n   the task w i l l be cleared o u t . it is very important to preserve some of the i n f o r m a t i o n f o r f u r t h e r deduction. in mdm  there are some h e u r i s t i c rules conducting t h i s informat i o n i n h e r i t a n c e . the r e l a t e d i n f o r m a t i o n is stored in a f r a m e - l i k e s t r u c t u r e as shown in f i g . 1 . it can be applied to the succeeding operations by matching the corresponding r u l e s . for example  
	i f : 	1  	task x generates task y  
1  y is a deeper task  
then: i n h e r i t i n f o r m a t i o n producing  produced  score.

conclusion 
   in t h i s paper we introduce the concept of h i e r a r c h i c a l 	s t r u c t u r e to the agenda. 	the strategy constrains the competition between tasks  	s i m p l i f i e s the reason formation mechanism  and preserves the f l e x i b i l i t y of the ordinary agenda by i n t r o ducing the key t a s k s . 	this strategy is e s p e c i a l l y important in developing complex systems  	such as systems i n c l u d i n g knowledge a c q u i s i t i o n   l e a r n i n g   and problem s o l v i n g   	with higher c o n t r o l e f f i ciency. 	this is the eventual 	aim of our work
