1. 	introduction 
this paper describes a segmentation algorithm which forms part of a recognition system for natural speech on the basis of phonemes and phoneme-like elements  fig. i   . the topic of this paper w i l l be confined to the segmentation steps; the remaining steps of the system have been described elsewhere /hess 1  1  1/. 
the extreme difference between the information content of the acoustic speech signal and i t s w r i t t e n counterpart forms one p r i n c i p a l problem of any automatic speech recognition system. the c l a s s i f i e r i t s e l f which c l a s s i f i e s the signal i n t o the desired output classes  such as words  phonemes etc.  usua l l y cannot cope with an information content too large. therefore it needs a preprocessor which r e -
duces the great redundancy of the s i g n a l . for t h i s   one has to extract a series of s i g n i f i c a n t parameters which  whatever they are  maintain most of the  phonetic  information s i g n i f i c a n t for the c l a s s i f i e r   but throw off a great part of the signal r e dundancy. another problem in recognition of c o n t i n uous speech is given by the fact that the output of the recognizer has to be discrete in time  and that the c l a s s i f i e r can process a limited number of out-
put classes only. thus  it is obvious that the output of the c l a s s i f i e r in a recognition system for continuous speech cannot be words and even not be s y l l a b l e s /olson  1/. recognition on the basis of phonemes or similar elementary u n i t s   however  requires time l o c a l i z a t i o n of these units in the speech s i g n a l . that means  it poses the problem of segmentation. it is l e f t to the processing strategy whether segmentation is done together with c l a s s i f i c a t i o n  recognition  or during the preprocessing 
step /paulus 1/. in the system described here  segmentation is performed as early as possible. 
the f i r s t approach to segmentation is already found in vocoder speech transmission systems. this step which  in the f o l l o w i n g   is labeled  pre-segmentation   determines two binary features of the t e c h n i s c h e t e c h n i s c h e 	u n i v e r s i t a t u n i v e r s i t a t 	mqnchen munchen

a  when r e a l i z i n g a spoken phoneme  the vocal tract f i r s t w i l l adjust i t s e l f to a target p o s i t i o n   then w i l l remain there for a cert a i n time  and f i n a l l y   w i l l move to the target p o s i t i o n associated with the next

 see example in f i g . 1   . the influence of the processing d i r e c t i o n causes s i g n i f i c a n t errors and  for t h i s reason  has to be eliminated. that means that the minimal segments cannot be computed timesequentially. hence  an intermediate f u n c t i o n   the  segment-length-function  slf is defined in the following way: 

this d e f i n i t i o n is v a l i d 	for any of the parameters 
p. tt is extended to the binary features in a way that any change of these features is regarded a major one. 1. is the length of the minimal segment which ends at point n  whereas 1   stands n k 
for the length of the minimal segment beginning at n. thus  the slf describes beginning and end of every s i g n i f i c a n t change in the c o n t r o l l i n g parameter and  thus  locates a l l dynamic segments. in eq. 1  the slf i s defined for one parameter at a time only. if more parameters have to be regarded  a combined slf is defined as: 

a single parameter p. according to eq. 1. the combined slf is computed as the minimum of the slf values for the i n d i v i d u a l parameters p.. this def i n i t i o n again emphasizes the dynamic segments  since the value of the slf is determined by a s i n gle major change of one of the parameters already. 
after computing the combined slf of the whole s i g n a l   the minimal segments are determined in a way that fi rst a l l microsegments with slf-1  microsegments  are combined to minimal segments after that the microsegments with sfl=1 e t c .  fig. 1 and 1   . 
before t h a t   the slf has been smoothed in a way that the di fference between adjacent slf values cannot be greater than one. in order to maintain the exact l o c a l i z a t i o n of the dynamic segments  the slf must not increase i t s value at any point during the smoothing procedure. this step from the microsegment to the slf reap. to the minimal segment provides minimum dependence of the f u r t h e r segmentation steps on the parameters a p p l i e d   and 
 - by means of the thresholds q - also minimum dependence on the i n d i v i d u a l speaker. since it can influence the magnitude of the slf but not i t s s t r u c t u r e   especially the s i t u a t i o n of i t s extremes  in an e s s e n t i a l way  the i n d i v i d u a l adjustment of the thresholds q is not too c r i t i c a l   f i g . 1   .

the f o l l o w i n g steps labels a l l the minimal segments  dynamic     s t a t i o n a r y     or  undefined . adjacent minimal segments w i t h equal l a b e l i n g are grouped together to  primary  segments. a minimal segment c e r t a i n l y can be labeled dynamic when  during i t s course  there is a major change between adjacent microsegments. a minimal segment c e r t a i n ly is s t a t i o n a r y when there is no major change in any parameter during a wider neighbourhood  1 ms or more . the rest of the minimal segments not belonging to one of these categories is labeled   u n d e f i n e d     f i g . 1   .

where l represents the number of microsegments in the m-th primary segment  are determined for a l l segments and a l l parameters. b m is a c r i t e r i o n for the o v e r - a l l change of each parameter w i t h i n a segment  whereas c  is a c r i t e r i o n for the d i r e c t i o n of change as well as for i t s degree of monotony. if the course of the c o n t r o l l i n g parameter p w i t h in a segment is monotonically increasing or decreasing  the absolute value of c m w i l l be situated in the v i c i n i t y of 1. otherwise  the value c m w i l l be situated around 1.after computing these values  the dynamic segments are transformed into   t r a n s i t i o n a l   segments by determining t h e i r d i r e c t i o n c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s . monotonic segments are labeled   t r a n s i t i o n a l - r i s i n g   r e s p .   t r a n s i t i o n a l - f a i l i n g   . each non-monotonic dynamic segment is subdivided into monotonic fractions if it exceeds a c e r t a i n length  see fig. 1 . in order to create a unique determination of d i r e c t i o n c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s when several segmentation parameters arc involved  in each dynamic segment  one of the parameters is selected and labeled dominant for the d i r e c t i o n character i s t i c of that p a r t i c u l a r segment resp. the t r a n s i t i o n a l segment s  which w i l l result from it /hess  1/.

as can be seen in f i g . 1  it is not p r o v i d e d by the a l g o r i t h m to s p l i t up an unde f ined segment i n to more than two segments. this may prove s u f f i c i e n t f o r i s o l a t e d w o r d s ; in connec ted s p e e c h   however  there e x i s t longer u n d e f i n e d segments which may cons i st of three and more phonemes. these segments arc t r e a t e d in a r e c u r s i ve way.

since the segmentation parameters* f o r b e t t e r acc u r a c y   are measured p i t c h - s y n c h r o n o u s l y   one must regard t h a t the speaker may u t t e r i r r e g u l a r s i g nals o r t h a t p i t c h d e t e c t i o n may f a i l t e m p o r a r i l y /hess  1 1 . 1 / . the e f f e c t s of t h i s type of e r r o r are reduced by smoothing the s e g m e n t a t i o n paramet e r s where such an e r r o r is d e t e c t e d . u s u a l l y   a s l i g h t parameter smoothing is done where p i t c h is r e g u l a r ; a medium smoothing is performed on v o i c e less s e c t i o n s . i r r e g u l a r sect ions have to he smoothed in a way t h a t parameter extremes due to i n c o r r e c t measurements are reduced to almost z e r o . 
thus  if an obviously nonsense segment combination is detected which could have been caused by a parameter e r r o r   the involved part of the s ignal parameters w i l l be smoothed as if it were i r r e g u l a r   and  a f t e r t h a t   w i l l be reprocessed by the segmentation algorithm.among the segmentation r e s u l t s which w i l l cause smoothing and reprocessing are the f o l l o w i n g combinations: 
a  clusters of more than three t r a n s i t i o n a l segments 
b  failure of the algorithm to divide a non-mo-
notonic dynamic segment i n t o monotonic t r a n s i t i o n a l ones 
c  clustering of   may-be -segments or verv short s t a t i o n a r y segments. 
1 hidden 	s t a t i o n a r y segments. 
two important special cases have been remaining  fig. 1   . they represent the only errors i n t r o duced by the strong emphasis of the dynamic segments in the d e f i n i t i o n of the slf and the minimal segments: 
a  a local minimum of q w i t h i n a t r a n s i t i o n a l segment  e s p e c i a l l y a f t e r a pause or a voiceless segment  points to a short g l i d e 
or nasal which could not be detected due to a substantial increase in both levels l  and l. . at th i s point. the algor l thm 
inserts a  may-be-stat ionary  segment. 
b  the sequence   t r a n s i t i o n a l - r i s i n g ' v ' t r a n s i -t i o n a l - f a l 1 i n g   in stationary environment or immediately a f t e r a pause leads to a vowel 
being too short to form a s t a t i o n a r y segment  e.g. a reduced vowel . here  the a l g o r i t h m inserts the missing stat ionary segment in the middle  if the two t r a n s i t i o n a l segments 
are long enough. 
1 s e n s i t i v i t y of the slf algorithm with respect to the values of the parameters. 
there is one e r r o r associated with eqs . 1 and 1  that means with the d e f i n i t i o n of the slf. if the value of the correct!on factor in eq. 1 is h i g h   r.  represents a value about p r n p o r t i o n a l to the absolute parameter change. if the value of k is situated near zero  r.. represents the r e l a t i v e parameter change. in both cases  the resu1ts show that the values of r.   and  subsequentlv  the slf values  associated with a normal phoneme boundary depend on the absolute value of the signal level at that p o i n t . therefore besides the threshold q   the correct ion factor k represent s an add i t iona 1 degree of freedom which may balance the response of the system to a phoneme boundary with respect to the values of the parameters at the p o i n t regarded.
