 	ii the representation 

       usually semantic parsers of nlu systems r e l y on some type of 'deep cases'  riesbeck and schank  1    trost and steinacker  1  to c o n t r o l a n a l y s i s . while we do not want to deny the advantages of such an approach  we use it o u r s e l v e s     we propose to apply a d i f f e r e n t approach in order to analyse words that derive t h e i r meaning from the semantic category of t h e i r dependent c o n s t i t u e n t s . the algorithm we present in t h i s paper disambiguates such words by making use of one of the important p r o p e r t i e s of an si-net  brachman 1   the s t r i c t d i s t i n c t i o n between s t r u c t u r e and contents of the n e t . s t r u c t u r a l l y a l l semantic r e l a t i o n s are represented in the same way therefore we evaluate t h i s l e v e l to f i n d out if there is a r e l a t i o n between the representation of the c o n s t i t u e n t s of such a word. after a l i n k has been found i t s semantic i n t e r p r e t a t i o n is taken to be the sense of the word. besides being used f o r disambiguation the algorithm is a p p l i c a b l e to solve other problems r e l a t e d to parsing as w e l l

       in n a t u r a l languages there e x i s t a number of words that derive t h e i r meaning from the semantic category of t h e i r dependent c o n s t i t u e n t s . we w i l l c a l l such words r e l a t i o n a l words. they are used to express an association between t h e i r c o n s t i t u e n t s . examples f o r r e l a t i o n a l words a r e : 
- possessive pronouns  my j o b   my s i s t e r   my 	car  
- to have  to have a c o l d   to have a c h i l d   
- to give  to give a k i s s   to give an o b j e c t   
- to get   t o get an answer  	to get a degree  
　　　to i n t e r p r e t such words on the basis of a semantic net there e x i s t two s o l u t i o n s :

　　　this paper demonstrates how the s t r u c t u r a l p r o p e r t i e s of the si-net  brachman  1  can be evaluated as a basis f o r such a general procedure. 
　　　the meaning of a lexeme is represented in the net by a s t r u c t u r e of a r b i t r a r y size and complexity. some words are mapped onto concepts o n l y   e . g .

iv overview of the 	parser 

v disambiguation by structural relations 

       the parser of the system v1e-lang maps german sentences onto instances of net s t r u c t u r e s without d i s c r i m i n a t i n g between s y n t a c t i c and semantic i n f o r m a t i o n . it takes advantage of the strong c o r r e l a t i o n between s y n t a c t i c surface cases and the semantic cases represented w i t h i n the net 
 steinacker and t r o s t   1    steinacker et a l .   1 . the parser uses a parsing l e x i c o n which contains the production r u l e s f o r each sense of a word by which the mapping is achieved. both methods f o r disambiguation mentioned above are used by the parser. 
       the f i r s t approach - l i s t i n g a l l word senses e x p l i c i t l y  boguraev  1    riesbeck and schank  1  - is applied to words with c l e a r l y defined senses. to disambiguate such a word s y n t a c t i c i n f o r m a t i o n combined w i t h s e l e c t i o n a l r e s t r i c t i o n s provides s u f f i c i e n t i n f o r m a t i o n to select the c o r r e c t sense. e.g. ' t o work* in the sense of to have a job is d i s c r i m i n a t e d from 'the machine works f i n e ' by s e l e c t i o n a l r e s t r i c t i o n s of the s u b j e c t . 
       r e l a t i o n a l words are used in a d i f f e r e n t way. besides having one o r i g i n a l sense   e . g . ownership f o r a possessive pronoun  they have a number of senses i n d i c a t i n g an a s s o c i a t i o n  hayes  1  between t h e i r dependent c o n s t i t u e n t s . the type of r e l a t i o n s h i p is determined by the semantic class of the c o n s t i t u e n t s . by merely looking at the problem of disambiguating the verb 'to have' as an example of a r e l a t i o n a l word the necessity of a general procedure is demonstrated. 
	some ways of using the verb 	' t o have': 
ownership: i have a new car s o c i a l r e l a t i o n s h i p : 1 have a f r i e n d source: i have good news s t a t e of h e a l t h : 1 have a cold paraphrase f o r a c t i o n : 	1 have breakfast p r o p e r t i e s : 	this s h i r t has a nice c o l o u r . 
       to include a l l senses of a r e l a t i o n a l word in the d i c t i o n a r y is an approach doomed to f a i l u r e . i t i s impossible t o foresee a l l the contexts i n which such a word w i l l be used; besides s e l e c t i n g one sense out of a long l i s t of senses in the d i c t i o n a r y would r e q u i r e extensive processing. a d d i t i o n a l l y the e n t r i e s in the l e x i c o n would have to be adopted every time there is an increase of vocabulary or concepts in the semantic n e t . 
       therefore a general approach is c a l l e d f o r   an approach that r e l i e s on means other than semantic classes and surface features of the sentences. 
       our method seeks the r e l a t i o n s h i p between two given concepts a t the 	s t r u c t u r a l 	l e v e l 	then 	i t r e t u r n s 	to 	the 	semantic 	l e v e l 	to 	f i n d 	the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n . 
       our disambiguation algorithm is based on the c o n n e c t i v i t y c o n d i t i o n . it makes use of the property of an si-net to d i s c r i m i n a t e s t r i c t l y between the s t r u c t u r e of the net and i t s contents  lo disambiguate a r e l a t i o n a l word the parser looks at the r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s of i t s dependent c o n s t i t u e n t s t o see i f the c o n n e c t i v i t y c o n d i t i o n i s f u l f i l l e d f o r them   s t r u c t u r a l l e v e l   . i f the two addressed concepts are connected by a r o l e   t h i s r o l e is taken to be the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the r e l a t i o n a l word  semantic l e v e l   . instead of having to check s y n t a c t i c c o n d i t i o n s and s e l e c t i o n a l r e s t r i c t i o n s f o r a great number of readings of the verb  the problem is reduced to three cases: 
 1  most r e l a t i o n a l words have one ' o r i g i n a l ' sense characterized by a s p e c i f i c s e l e c t i o n a l r e s t r i c t i o n     e . g . to give - t r a n s f e r of an o b j e c t   
 1  in the case of paraphrasing an event   e . g . to give a k i s s = to kiss  the r e l a t i o n a l verbs hold a d d i t i o n a l information on how to f i l l the a t t r i b u t e s of t h a t event. the cc is f u l f i l l e d f o r a l l c a s e - f i l l e r s of the designated event. 
 1  if the dependent c o n s t i t u e n t s s a t i s f y the cc    e . g . to have a cold - r e l a t i o n between a person and his health  the l i n k between them i s i n d i v i d u a t e d . 
       with t h i s general procedure the number of e n t r i e s f o r a r e l a t i o n a l word in the parsing l e x i c o n i s reduced d r a s t i c a l l y .

       in the f o l l o w i n g paragraph the a l g o r i t h m is demonstrated by some examples analysing d i f f e r e n t r e l a t i o n a l words. 
 1  he gave a good answer. 
 1  he got a headache. 
 1  my thoughts 
       to f i n d the sense of the r e l a t i o n a l words one has to examine t h e i r dependent c o n s t i t u e n t s . before a r e l a t i o n a l word can be i n t e r p r e t e d   the system must be able to access the concepts onto which the c o n s t i t u e n t s are mapped. 

　　　in  1  'answer1 is represented by the concept infotrans which is a subconcept of event therefore sense1 is applicable. even if the type of event is not known beforehand the verb 'to give' controls the way attributes are to be f i l l e d . therefore this information is included in the parsing lexicon. the subject either represents the *agent  he gives her a spanking  or the  source of a transfer. the role which is applicable is selected according to the type of event addressed by the direct object. the verb 'to get' behaves in a complementary way i t s subject is mapped on *object  he got a kick  or *recipient  he gets a kiss . 
　　　in  1  the cc is f u l f i l l e d   headache is mapped onto an individual of statejdf healtk which is connected to person by the role *health. 
　　　 1  leads to individuation of *agent between the referent of 'my' and the action mdo. 
	sometimes possessive pronouns are 	ambiguous: 
'my present' is interpreted preferably as 'the present that 1 get' but the sense 'the present that i give' exists as well. in this case the sentential context has to be considered. 
vi further applications 
　　　there is a wide range of applications for such a general procedure which is based on structural properties. besides interpreting relational words in an efficient way  such procedures can also be used to try to solve ad hoc metaphors that are based on analogy. the well known example 'my car drinks gasoline'  wilks  1  can be interpreted by using the connectivity condition. the concepts gas and automobile are connected by a role *fuel. since the connectivity condition is f u l f i l l e d this structure is taken to be the meaning of the sentence. 
　　　another very useful application is reference resolution of definite noun phrases  leinfellner et a l .   1    sidner  1 . 'when 1 washed the glass the handle broke.' the cc indicates a relationship between glass and handle  therefore handle is interpreted to be part of the glass  and what a great number of handles are there! .

vii conclusion 
　　　the advantages of a general procedure to select senses of a relational word are obvious: 
- there is no need to l i s t the great number of senses explicitly within the dictionary. although the class of relational words is relatively small they appear frequently in natural language texts. evaluating the cc therefore saves storage as well as time. 
- independence of changes within vocabulary and semantic net. since the algorithm relies on structural properties it can be applied to a l l concepts. new concepts added to the net are covered automatically. 
- the same procedure is applicable for a l l relational words. 
- the approach can be successfully applied in connection with other problems of parsing: reference resolution and processing of metaphors. the connectivity condition describes an association between concepts. such an association can be evaluated within different phenomena of language.
