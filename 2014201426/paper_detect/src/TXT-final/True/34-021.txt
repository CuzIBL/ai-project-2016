	i. 	preface 
       in an attempt to provide theory where there have been mostly unrelated systems  minsky  1  recently described the work of schank  1a   abelson  1   charniak  1   and norman  1  as f i t t i n g i n t o the notion of  frames.  minsky a t tempted to r e l a t e t h i s work  in what is e s s e n t i a l l y language processing  to areas of vision research that conform to the same n o t i o n . 
　　　mlnsky's frames paper has created quite a s t i r in ai and some immediate spinoff research along the lines of developing frames manipulators   e . g . bobrow  1; winograd  1 . we f i n d that we agree w i t h much of what minsky said about frames and w i t h his characterization of our own work. the frames idea is so general  however  that it does not lend i t s e l f to applications without further s p e c i a l i z a t i o n . this paper is an attempt to develop f u r t h e r the lines of thought set out in schank  1a  and abelson  1; 1a . the ideas presented here can be viewed as a s p e c i a l i z a t i o n of the frame idea. we s h a l l refer to our central cons t r u c t s as   s c r i p t s .   
	i i . 	the problem 
　　　researchers in natural language understanding have f e l t for some time that the eventual l i m i t on the s o l u t i o n of our problem w i l l be our a b i l i t y to characterize world knowledge. various researchers have approached world knowledge in various ways. winograd  1  dealt with the problem by severely r e s t r i c t i n g the w o r l d . this approach had the pos i t i v e e f f e c t of producing a working system and the negative e f f e c t of producing one that was only 
minimally extendable. charniak  1  approached the problem from the other end e n t i r e l y and has made some i n t e r e s t i n g f i r s t steps  but because his work is not grounded in any representational system or any working computational system the rest r i c t i o n of world knowledge need not c r i t i c a l l y concern him. 
our f e e l i n g is that an e f f e c t i v e c h a r a c t e r i -
zation of knowledge can result in a real understanding system in the not too distant f u t u r e . we expect that programs based on the theory we outl i n e here and on our previous work on conceptual dependency and b e l i e f systems w i l l combine with the margie system  schank et a l .   1 a; riesbeck  1; rieger  1  to produce a working understander. we see understanding as the f i t t i n g of new information i n t o a previously organized view of the world. we have therefore extended our work on language analysis  schank  1a; riesbeck 1  to understanding - an understander  l i k e an analyzer  should be  bottom up  u n t i l it gets enough information to make predictions and become 
 top down.  e a r l i e r work has found various ways in which a word in a single sentence sets up expectations about what is l i k e l y to be found in the rest of the sentence. a single sentence and i t s corresponding conceptualizations set up expectations about what is to follow in the rest of a discourse or story. these expectations characterize the world knowledge that bears on a given s i t u a t i o n   and it is these expectations that we wish to explore. 
	iii. 	scripts 
　　　a s c r i p t   as we use i t   is a structure that describes an appropriate sequence of events in a p a r t i c u l a r context. a s c r i p t is made up of s l o t s and requirements about what can f i l l those s l o t s . the structure is an interconnected whole  and what is in one slot affects what can be in another. scripts handle s t y l i z e d everyday s i t u a t i o n s . they are not subject to much change  nor do they provide the apparatus for handling novel s i t u a t i o n s   as plans do  see section v . 
　　　for our purposes  a s c r i p t is a predetermined  stereotyped sequence of actions that define a well-known s i t u a t i o n . a s c r i p t i s   in e f f e c t   a 
　　　very boring l i t t l e story. scripts allow for new references to objects w i t h i n them j u s t as if these objects had been previously mentioned; objects w i t h i n a s c r i p t may take   t h e   without e x p l i c i t introduction because the s c r i p t i t s e l f has a l ready i m p l i c i t l y introduced them.  this can be found below  in the reference to  the w a i t r e s s   in a restaurant  for example.  
　　　stories can invoke s c r i p t s in various ways. usually a story is a s c r i p t with one or more i n teresting deviations. 
	i. 	john went i n t o the restaurant. 
he ordered a hamburger and a coke. 
he asked the waitress for the check and l e f t . 
i i . john went to a restaurant. 
he ordered a hamburger. 
it was cold when the waitress brought i t . he l e f t her a very small t i p . 
t 	the work of the second author was f a c i l i t a t e d by national science foundation crant cs-1. 
1 i i i . harriet went to a birthday party. 
she put on a green paper hat. 
just when they sat down to eat the cake  a piece of plaster f e l l from the c e i l i n g 
onto the table. 
she was lucky  because the dust d i d n ' t get a l l over her h a i r . 
iv. harriet went to jack's birthday party. 
the cake tasted awful. 
harriet l e f t jack's mother a very small t i p . 
　　　paragraph i is an unmodified s c r i p t . it is d u l l . it would be even d u l l e r if a l l the events in the standard restaurant s c r i p t  see below  were included. 
　　　paragraph ii is a restaurant s c r i p t with a stock v a r i a t i o n   	a customer's typical reaction 
when things go wrong. 
　　　paragraph i i i invokes the birthday party s c r i p t   but something wholly outside the range of normal birthday parties occurs - the plaster f a l l s from the c e i l i n g . this deviation from the s c r i p t takes over the i n i t i a t i v e in the narrative u n t i l the problem it raises is resolved  but the b i r t h day s c r i p t is s t i l l available in the i n d i r e c t reference to the party hat and in the p o s s i b i l i t y that normal party a c t i v i t i e s be resumed l a t e r in the n a r r a t i v e . it seems natural for reference to 
be made to dust in the hair following the p l a s t e r ' s 
f a l l i n g   which implies that there is a kind of s c r i p t for f a l l i n g plaster too. 	 this kind of s c r i p t we c a l l a vignette  abelson  1a .  	not i c e that  the c e i l i n g   refers to an uninteresting  room  s c r i p t   which can be used for references to doors and windows that may occur. 	thus it is possible to be in more than one s c r i p t at a time. 
　　　paragraph iv i l l u s t r a t e s the kind of absurdity that arises when an action from one s c r i p t is a r b i t r a r i l y inserted into another. that one feels the absurdity is an indication that scripts are in inadmlssable competition. it is conceivable that 
with adequate introduction the absurdity in paragraph iv could be eliminated. 
　　　with these examples  a number of issues have been raised. let us at t h i s point give a more extensive description of s c r i p t s . we have discussed previously  schank  1b  how paragraphs are represented in memory as causal chains. this work implies t h a t   for a story to be understood  i n f e r ences must connect each input conceptualization to a l l the others in the story that r e l a t e to i t . this connection process is f a c i l i t a t e d tremendously by the use of s c r i p t s . 
　　　scripts are extremely numerous. 	there is a restaurant s c r i p t   a birthday party s c r i p t   a f o o t b a l l game s c r i p t   a classroom s c r i p t   and so on. each s c r i p t has players who assume roles in the a c t i o n . 	a s c r i p t takes the point of view of one of these players  	and it often changes when it is viewed from another player's point of view. 
　　　the following is a sketch of a s c r i p t for a restaurant from the point of view of the customer. actions are specified in terms of the p r i m i t i v e 
acts of conceptual dependency theory  schank  1b. 
s c r i p t : 	restaurant r o l e s : 	customer  waitress  chef  cashier reason: 	to get food so as to go up in pleasure and down in hunger 
scene 1: entering 
ptrans self into restaurant 
attend eyes to where empty tables are 

       in t h i s s c r i p t   the instruments for performing an action might vary with circumstances. for example  in scene 1 the order might be spoken  or w r i t t e n down wi th predesignated numbers for each item  or even   i n a foreign country wi th an unfam i l i a r language  indicated by pointing or gestures. 
　　　each act sequence uses the p r i n c i p l e of causal chaining  schank  1b abelson  1 . that i s   each action results in conditions that enable the next to occur. to perform the next act in the sequence  the previous acts must be completed s a t i s f a c t o r i l y . if they cannot be  the hitches must 
be dealt w i t h . perhaps a new action not prescribed in the s c r i p t w i l l be generated in order to get things moving again. this   w h a t - i f   behavior  to be discussed l a t e r   is an important component of s c r i p t s . it is associated with many of the deviations in stories such as paragraph it. 
　　　in a t e x t   new s c r i p t information is i n t e r preted in terms of i t s place in one of the causal chains w i t h i n the s c r i p t . thus in paragraph 1 the f i r s t sentence describes the f i r s t action in scene 1 of the restaurant s c r i p t . sencence 1 refers to the last action of scene 1  and sentence 1 to the f i r s t and last actions of scene a. the f i n a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of paragraph i contains the e n t i r e restaurant s c r i p t   with specific statements f i l l e d in and missing statements  that he sat down  f o r 
example  assumed. 
　　　in paragraph i i   the f i r s t two sentences describe actions in scenes 1 and 1. part of the t h i r d sentence is in the s c r i p t as the f i r s t action of scene 1  but there is also the information that the hamburger is c o l d . the fourth sentence   he l e f t her a very small t i p     is a m o d i f i c a t i o n of the t h i r d action of scene 1. the modifier   very s m a l l     is presumably related to the unexpected information about the  cold hamburger.  even a stupid processor  checking paragraph ii against the standard restaurant s c r i p t   could come up w i t h the low-level hypothesis that the small size of the t i p must have something to do with the temperature of the hamburger  since these two items of information are the only deviations from the s c r i p t . they must be related deviations  because if they were unrelated the narrative would have no business ending with two such unexplained features. 
　　　of course we do not want our processor to be stupid. in s l i g h t l y more complex examples  adequate understanding requires a t t e n t i o n to the na-

1 

ture of deviations from the s c r i p t . a smarter processor can infer from a cold hamburger that the incest in scene 1 w i l l then v i o l a t e the pleasure goal for going to a restaurant. the concept of a very small t i p car stored with the restaurant s c r i p t as a what-if associated w i t h v i o l a t i o n s of the pleasure goal. 
　　　the general form for a s c r i p t   then  is a set of paths joined at certain c r u c i a l points that define the s c r i p t . for restaurants the crucial parts are the ingest and the atrans of money. there are many normal ways to move from point to point. ordering may be done by mtransing to a waiter or by selecting and taking what you l i k e 
　　　 in a c a f e t e r i a   . likewise the atrans of money may be done by going to the cashier  or paying the waitress  or saying   put it on my b i l l .   there are also paths to take when s i t u a t i o n s don't go as planned. paragraphs iii and iv c a l l up deviant paths in the birthday party s c r i p t . a l l these variations indicate that a s c r i p t is not a simple l i s t of events but rather a linked causal chain; a script can branch into multiple possible paths that come together at c r u c i a l defining points. 
　　　to know when a s c r i p t is appropriate  s c r i p t headers are necessary. these headers define the circumstances under which a s c r i p t is called into play. the headers for the restaurant s c r i p t are concepts having to do with hunger  restaurants  and so on in the context of a plan of action for g e t t i n g fed. obviously contexts must be r e s t r i c t ed to avoid c a l l i n g up the restaurant script for sentences that use the word  restaurant  as a 
　　　place   fuel o i l was delivered to the restaurant  . 
　　　scripts organize new inputs in terms of previously stored knowledge. in paragraph i  many itenfi. that are part of the restaurant script are added to the f i n a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the s t o r y . we don't need to say that a waitress took the customer's order or that he ate the hamburger. these ideas are f i r m l y a part of the story because the restaurant script requires them. in understanding a story that c a l l s up a s c r i p t   the s c r i p t becomes part of the story even when it is not spelled out. the answer to the question  who served john the hamburger   seems obvious  because our world knowledge  as embodied in s c r i p t s   answers i t   
what-ifs 
　　　there are at least three major ways in which s c r i p t s can be thrown o f f normal course. one is d i s t r a c t i o n   i n t e r r u p t i o n by another s c r i p t   such as the p l a s t e r ' s f a l l i n g from the c e l l i n g . we 
w i l l not pursue here an analysis of the conditions and consequences of d i s t r a c t i o n . the other two ways  obstacle and e r r o r   are intimately connected with w h a t - i f behavior. an obstacle to the normal sequence occurs when someone or something prevents a normal action from occurring or some usual enab l i n g condition for the action is absent. an error occurs when the action is completed in an i n appropriate manner  so that the normal consequences of the action do not come about. 
　　　in p r i n c i p l e   every simple act in a standard s c r i p t has p o t e n t i a l obstacles and e r r o r s . we assume t h a t   every time an obstacle or error occurs in a s c r i p t that is being learned  the methods used to remove the obstacle or redeem the error are stored w i t h the s c r i p t as w h a t - i f s . the r e sult of many r e p e t i t i o n s is that most of the common w h a t - i f s are attached to the s c r i p t . 
every obstacle has one or more c h a r a c t e r i s t i c 
w h a t - i f s . in scene 1 of the restaurant s c r i p t   if the waitress ignores the customer  he w i l l try to catch her eye or c a l l to her when she passes nearby. if he can't make out the menu or needs f u r ther information  he w i l l ask the waitress. if she doesn't speak his language  he w i l l attempt her language  or make gestures  or seek another customer to t r a n s l a t e   or accept her suggestion of 
what to order. in scene 1  if the waitress does not bring the food  he w i l l again t r y to catch her eye. if the food is not f i t   he w i l l send it back. 
　　　errors have a s l i g h t l y d i f f e r e n t character from obstacles but follow the same general r u l e s . receiving the menu is e r r o r f u l if the waitress atranses a p r i n t e d sheet to the customer but it is yesterday's menu  or the breakfast instead of the dinner menu. reading the menu may y i e l d an error if the customer gets the wrong idea of what it says - say  he thinks f i l e t mignon is a f i s h . here it is up to the waitress to supply the whatif c o r r e c t i v e . deciding what to order may y i e l d 
an error if the customer goes through the decision process but forgets the stored outcome. the whatif is to review the mbuild   let's see now  what 
did 1 decide    giving the order to the waitress may be in error if she writes down something other than what the customer said  or omits a portion of i t . the what-if is to repeat the order  asking the waitress whether she is sure she got a l l of 
i t . 
iv. the sam program 
　　　we have created a program that uses s c r i p t s to make inferences in domains it knows about and have added it to the margie program reported at 
1jcai. sam  script applier mechanism  receives conceptual dependency structures as input  these are gotten from english by using riesbeck's parser 
	 1  . 	sam i d e n t i f i e s the s c r i p t to be used 
 by using riesbeck's request format  and f i l l s in the i d e n t i f i e d s c r i p t w i t h the new inputs as they are received. it makes the inferences that are necessary to complete a causal chain between i n put conceptualizations  see schank  1b  f o r a discussion of causal chains . the resultant complex structure can then be queried by input engl i s h questions or be used to make summaries and paraphrases of the i n i t i a l story. sam was w r i t ten by chris riesbeck  richard cullingford and wendy lehnert. goldman's generation program  1  is used to map the answers of paraphrases into english. it was modified for this purpose by gerald dejong and w.j. stutzman. an example of sam's input and output i s : 
1 

q: what happened when john went to the table  
a: the hostess cave him a menu and john sat down. 
q: why did john get a menu  
a: so he could order. 
q: why did john give the waiter a large tip  a: because he was served quickly. 
paraphrase: 
john decided he was going to go to a restaurant. john went to a restaurant. john indi-
cated to the host he would like to be at a 
	table. 	the host indicated to john he could 
	go to a table. 	john went to the table. 	the 
host went to the table. john sat down in the chair. john got the menu from the host. 
john read the menu. the waiter saw john was at the table. the watter went to the table. 
	john ordered lobster. 	the chef prepared the 
lobster. the waiter got the lobster from the chef. the waiter served john the lobster. 
	john ate the lobster. 	john indicated to the 
waiter he would like to get the check from him. john got the check from the waiter. john left the waiter a large tip. john paid the check. john left the restaurant. 
a low-level goal is i l l u s t r a t e d by: 
john wanted to cut h i s steak. 
he called to his wife in the kitchen. 
　　　a plan is a series of actions that w i l l r e a l ize a goal. often in order to realize one goal another must be decided on and a plan drawn up to achieve i t . in the f i r s t example above  a goal to a t t a i n power is reduced to a goal to get arsenic. high-level goals are more i n t e r e s t i n g and we have concentrated on them f i r s t . 
　　　we define a   d e l t a c t   as an action or a group of actions that leads to a desired s t a t e . deltacts constitute subplans that are pursued because of t h e i r intended e f f e c t s . there are f i v e deltacts in the present system: 


summary: 
john went to a restaurant and ate lobster. 
　　　this program rune on the pdp-1 at yale. it currently has only a small amount of knowledge and a small vocabulary. but we feel encouraged that our s c r i p t theory is workable because of the simp l i f i c a t i o n in the inference process that has r e sulted from the use of s c r i p t s . 
v  plans 
　　　plans are responsible for the deliberate behavior that people e x h i b i t . plans describe the set of choices that a person has when he sets out to accomplish a goal. in l i s t e n i n g to a d i s course   people use plans to make sense of seemingly disconnected sentences. by f i n d i n g a plan  an understander can make guesses about the intentions of an action in an unfolding story and use these guesses to make sense of the story. 
consider the following paragraph: 
john knew that his w i f e ' s operation would be very expensive. 
there was always uncle harry . . . 
he reached for the suburban phone book. 
how are we to make sense of such a paragraph  it makes no use of headers or the s c r i p t s they s i g n a l . it would be unreasonable to posit a  paying for an operation  script with a l l the necessary acts l a i d out as in our restaurant s c r i p t . but  on the other hand  the s i t u a t i o n is not e n t i r e l y novel  e i t h e r . the problem of understanding t h i s paragraph would not be s i g n i f i c a n t l y d i f f e r e n t if   w i f e ' s operation  were changed to  son's educat i o n   or  down payment on the mortgage.  there is a general goal state in each case  r a i s i n g a lot of money for a legitimate expense  and there is a generalized plan or group of plans that may lead to the goal s t a t e . 
　　　plans s t a r t with one or more goals. 	a highlevel goal is i l l u s t r a t e d by the sequence: 
john wanted to become king. 
he went to get some arsenic. 
there is also a set of lower-level d e l t a c t s  abelson  1a . plans are made up of d e l t a c t s . when a collocation of deltacts is used often enough  it becomes a s c r i p t . 
　　　a plan includes a set of planboxes  l i s t s of actions that w i l l y i e l d state changes and the preconditions for these actions  along with a set of questions for choosing the appropriate planbox. 
       for instance  the take plan has the goal of enabling the taker to do something with an o b j e c t   whatever is generally done with i t . to take something you must be close to i t   so e i t h e r the obj e c t and the taker must be in the same l o c a t i o n or the taker must use a subplan  prox. either no one else must have control of the object or at least there must be no bad consequences in the taker's attempt to ptrans the object to himself. the take plan c a l l s a ptrans of the object if a l l the preconditions are p o s i t i v e . 
　　　but i f   say  someone else controls the obj e c t   a plan for the taker's gaining control must be c a l l e d . this subplan is  cont.  cont has a set of planboxes attached to i t . these planboxes define a deltact just as inferences define a p r i m i t i v e act. a planbox is a l i s t of p r i m i t i v e acts that w i l l achieve a goal. associated w i t h each act are i t s preconditions  and a planbox checks them. a set of p o s i t i v e conditions allows the desired act. negative conditions c a l l up new planboxes or deltacts that have as their goal the resolution of the negative state. 
　　　preconditions f a l l i n t o three classes. a controlled precondition can be fixed when it is negative by doing an act. a negative uncontrolled precondition cannot be f i x e d   and another planbox must be t r i e d . negative mediating preconditions can be altered but require plans of t h e i r own to change. mediating preconditions usually r e f e r to the willingness of other parties to p a r t i c i p a t e in plans. further d e t a i l s on planboxes appear in schank  1c . 
　　　to see why an understander needs plans  consider the following sequence: 
willa was hungry. 
she took out the michelin guide. 
most readers understand that w i l l a was using the 
1 

m i c h e l i n guide to f i n d a good r e s t a u r a n t . but if the f i r s t sentence were s u b j e c t e d t o s t r a i g h t f o r -
ward i n f e r e n c e  a la r i e g e r   1     p r e d i c t i n g t h a t w i l l a is l i k e l y to do something to enable h e r s e l f to ingest fc the second sentence would seem to answer t h i s p r e d i c t i o n o n l y in the w e i r d i n t e r p r e t a t i o n that she w i l l eat the m i c h e l i n guide. a n understander w i l l r e j e c t t h i s i n favor o f any b e t t e r path t h a t i t can f i n d . the f i r s t sentence w i l l be analyzed f o r any goal t h a t might generate a p l a n .  hungry  is l i s t e d in the d i c t i o n a r y as i n d i c a t i n g the need f o r a plan to do a acont of food. one means f o r g a i n i n g c o n t r o l of food is a r e s t a u r a n t . an enablement f o r t h i s 
means 	is going 	to a r e s t a u r a n t   which r e q u i r e s aprox. 	t h i s in 	t u r n r e q u i r e s knowing where you are g o i n g   which may r e q u i r e aknow. 
       i n 	the d i c t i o n a r y   	a l l books are l i s t e d a s means of s a t i s f y i n g aknows and the m i c h e l i n guide is l i s t e d as a book. 	to complete the p r o c e s s i n g 
of t h i s sequence it w o u l d   of course  be necessary to have the i n f o r m a t i o n t h a t the m i c h e l i n guide l i s t s r e s t a u r a n t s . without t h i 1 i n f o r m a t i o n   the sequence might be as n o n s e n s i c a l as   w i l l a was hungry. she took out i n t r o d u c t i o n to a r t i f i c i a l

	v i . 	conclusion and prognosis 
       i t i s c l e a r t h a t i n o r d e r t o understand one needs knowledge. knowledge is a p o t e n t i a l l y u n w i e l d y t h i n g   so what we must do is determine the types of knowledge t h a t t h e r e are and f i n d out how to apply them. the sam system is a f i r s t step at adding s t r u e t u r e d knowledge to the margie system  schank et a l   1 . we are c u r r e n t l y b u i l d i n g up our knowledge base by adding more s c r i p t s to sam. in a d d i t i o n we are adding a plan component pam. these two programs should b r i n g us up to the l e v e l of u n d e r s t a n d i n g simple s t o r i e s about a l a r g e range of known domains. 
       but what about complex s t o r i e s   is the k i n d of u n d e r s t a n d i n g t h a t humans e x h i b i t on r e a l s t o r i e s l i k e l y to resemble the mechanisms to be found in sam  
       when a person reads a 1 page novel he does not   u n l e s s he is very unusual  remember a l l the c o n c e p t u a l i z a t i o n s s t a t e d in the s t o r y in the form of a g i a n t causal c h a i n . rather he remembers the g i s t of the book. maybe 1 or 1 pages of summary c o u l d be e x t r a c t e d from him a f t e r reading the 
book. p r e v i o u s l y we have said t h a t conceptual dependency theory w i l l account for memory f o r g i s t of sentences. but it cannot be s e r i o u s l y proposed t h a t t h i s i s a l l t h a t i s needed f o r g i s t of long and complex s t o r i e s . some o t h e r e x p l a n a t i o n must be g i v e n . 
       in a recent e x p e r i m e n t   abel son  1b  showed t h a t people remember s t o r i e s b e t t e r when they are asked to take some p a r t i c u l a r p o i n t of 
view   o f one of the p a r t i c i p a n t s or of an o b s e r v er in a p a r t i c u l a r p l a c e     and t h a t what they r e member is c o n t i n g e n t on which p o i n t of view they had. the r a m i f i c a t i o n s of t h i s experiment f o r a theory of language u n d e r s t a n d i n g have to be t h a t 
when people have a c l u e of what to f o r g e t they do b e t t e r at remembering. in other w o r d s   good f o r g e t t i n g i s the key t o remembering. l i k e w i s e   i f 
we want to b u i l d programs that remember  we had best teach them how to f o r g e t . one method of 
f o r g e t t i n g i s s i m p l y not n o t i c i n g l e v e l s o f det a i l t h a t are t h e r e . this can be done by t r e a t i n g 
the i n s t r u m e n t s f o r an a c t i o n at a d i f f e r e n t l e v e l than the main acts t h a t they e x p l a i n . when l o o k i n g at a s t o r y at one l e v e l of d e t a i l we w o u l d not see the l e v e l o f d e t a i l underneath i t u n l e s s spec i f i c a l l y c a l l e d upon to do so. 
       for example  c o n s i d e r the sentence   john went to new york by b u s .   we have p r e v i o u s l y r e p r e s e n t e d t h i s sentence by a simple act  ptrans   and an i n s t r u m e n t a l act  propel . but it must be r e a l i z e d t h a t a s w i t h any o t h e r s c r i p t   q u e s t i o n s could be answered about t h i s sentence t h a t were not s p e c i f i c a l l y i n i t . subjects a l l seem t o agree t h a t the answer to  was t h e r e a bus d r i v e r     is  yes  and to  did john pay money to get on the bus   i s   p r o b a b l y .   this seems t o i n d i c a t e t h a t the i n s t r u m e n t o f j o h n ' s ptrans i s   i n a c t u a l i t y   the e n t i r e bus s c r i p t . 
       should we  as u n d e r s t a n d e r s   go so f a r as to place the e n t i r e bus s c r i p t in what we o b t a i n from u n d e r s t a n d i n g the above sentence  the answer seems o b v i o u s . you d o n ' t want to do a l l t h a t u n l e s s you need t o   but you want to have q u i c k a c cess to it in case you need t o . 
	consider 	the 	f o l l o w i n g s t o r y : 
john wanted some cheesecake. he decided to go to new y o r k . he went to new york by b u s . on the bus he met a n i c e o l d lady who he t a l k e d to about the p r i c e s in the supermar-
k e t . when he l e f t the bus he thanked the d r i v e r f o r the r i d e and found the subway to go to l i n d y ' s . on the subway he was r e a d i n g the ads when suddenly he was robbed. he 
w a s n ' t h u r t though and he got o f f the t r a i n and e n t e r e d l i n d y ' s and had h i s cheesecake. when the check came  he s a i d he c o u l d n ' t pay and was t o l d he would have to wash d i s h e s . l a t e r he went back to new haven. 
i d e a l l y   our r e p r e s e n t a t i o n o f t h i s s t o r y should account f o r the f a c t t h a t hearers o f t h i s s t o r y i n v a r i a b l y f o r g e t the sentences about t a l k i n g to the o l d lady and the bus d r i v e r   but alwayb r e member the mugging  i t s consequence of d i s h w a s h i n g   and the main goal of going to new york to eat cheesecake.

　　　we propose to represent stories therefore in the following way: there w i l l be a causal chain connecting the main events of the story.  here the ptrans to the restaurant  the ingest  and the ptrans back home.  underneath each of these main events w i l l be the instrumental s c r i p t that underl i e s each of them.  the bus s c r i p t   the subway s c r i p t   and the restaurant s c r i p t .   these s c r i p t s w i l l be   f o r g o t t e n   to be reconstructed l a t e r   with the exception that any event that occurred w i t h i n them that was not predicated by them w i l l be placed on a  weird l i s t   to be specially remembered. 
　　　the f i n a l representation of a story w i l l cons i s t of the events connected d i r e c t l y to the goals and plans to realize those goals made by the part i c i p a n t s . these goals w i l l be tied to the events that actually occurred and to the weird events and t h e i r consequences. thus four l i s t s replace our 
o r i g i n a l  and growing  causal chain. an event l i s t  with script events l e f t o u t   ; a goal l i s t ; a plan l i s t ; and a weird l i s t . what these l i s t s do is help us forget. and of course f o r g e t t i n g helps us remember. 
　　　there are two ways in which this occurs: by omission and by prototyping. events which enter none of the four l i s t s  such as the conversation with the old lady   are dropped e n t i r e l y .  more precisely  they are retained only u n t i l the constructed f i n a l representation is transferred from working memory to long-term memory. anything not in t h i s f i n a l representation is l o s t .   also  the event l i s t and plan l i s t are condensed by using pointers to prototypes. the d e t a i l s are thus  normalized    b a r t l e t t   1 ; what is remembered is that a normal plan for s a t i s f y i n g such-and-such goal was used  including normal enactments of appropriate s c r i p t s . the function of the weird l i s t is to mark the i n t e r e s t i n g departures from these normalities. 
　　　what we are saying then is that one of the major issues in a r t i f i c i a l intelligence research much be the creation of the theory of f o r g e t t i n g . it simply is not possible to assume that people do  or that machines should  remember everything they encounter. in l i s t e n i n g to a speaker  reading a book  or engaging in a conversation  people 
could not possibly remember everything they are t o l d verbatim. in attempting to get the gist of a sequence  they must employ what we c a l l f o r g e t t i n g h e u r i s t i c s . as part of these f o r g e t t i n g heurist i c s   are h e u r i s t i c s that search out items of 
major importance. the selection of these major items is the key to f o r g e t t i n g . we don't r e a l l y 
wish to assert that people couldn't possibly r e member everything they hear. rather we wish to f i n d a procedure that w i l l l e t us see only the maj o r items  yet also f i n d   with some d i f f i c u l t y   the thoughts or statements that underlie them  and the ideas that underlie those  and so on. 
　　　thus  the key to understanding must be  in order to f a c i l i t a t e search among what has been understood  an organization of the new information  in such a fashion as to seem to forget the unimportant material and to highlight the important m a t e r i a l . forgetting h e u r i s t i c s must do this for us. so the f i r s t task before us is to establish what the most s i g n i f i c a n t items in a text are l i k e l y to be  and then to establish the heuristics 
which w i l l extract and remember exactly those items.
