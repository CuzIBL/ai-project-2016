the definition of “price”
　　prices determine how resources are to be used. they are also the means by which products and services that are in limited supply are rationed among buyers. the price system of the united states is a complex network composed of the prices of all the products bought and sold in the economy as well as those of a myriad of services  including labor  professional  transportation  and public-utility services. the interrelationships of all these prices make up the “system” of prices. the price of any particular product or service is linked to a broad  complicated system of prices in which everything seems to depend more or less upon everything else.
　　if one were to ask a group of randomly selected individuals to define “price”  many would reply that price is an amount of money paid by the buyer to the seller of a product or service or  in other words that price is the money values of a product or service as agreed upon in a market transaction. this definition is  of course  valid as far as it goes. for a complete understanding of a price in any particular transaction  much more than the amount of money involved must be known. both the buyer and the seller should be familiar with not only the money amount  but with the amount and quality of the product or service to be exchanged  the time and place at which the exchange will take place and payment will be made  the form of money to be used  the credit terms and discounts that apply to the transaction  guarantees on the product or service  delivery terms  return privileges  and other factors. in other words  both buyer and seller should be fully aware of all the factors that comprise the total “package” being exchanged for the asked-for amount of money in order that they may evaluate a given price.
