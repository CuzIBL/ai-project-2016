interfaces based on these principles. 
  • Acquisition interfaces should be able to represent acqui•
     sition goals explicitly. Many of the tutoring principles 
     suggest a more goal-oriented behavior for acquisition in•
     terfaces. Having acquisition goals explicitly and declar-
     atively is key to making a tool truly proactive because it 
     could then steer the dialogue with the user to work to•
     wards those goals. The goals that are achieved at each 
     point during the dialogue represent the progress made 
     towards acquiring the desired body of knowledge. 
  • Acquisition interfaces should have acquisition strategies 
     in order to understand and actively pursue what is in•
     volved in learning about a new topic. Acquisition strate•
     gies outline how to achieve acquisition goals. Because 
     so many things are unknown to the system during the 
     lesson, these strategies can only be pursued under the 
     user's guidance and in a mixed-initiative interaction. 
  • Acquisition tools should have awareness of what they 
     have learned already and what they do not know about 
     yet, so that they can better assess their competence and 
     confidence in specific topics, and steer the dialogue with 
     the user in directions that improve their body of knowl•
     edge on both counts. 
  SLICK is developed as a front-end to existing basic ac•
quisition tools by embodying these capabilities. For exam•          Figure 1: Acquiring military plans with SLICK.
