   Information Access research at Xerox PARC focuses 
on amplifying the users' cognitive abilities, rather than 
trying to completely automate them. This framework 
emphasizes the participation of the user in a cycle of 
query formulation, presentation of results, followed by 
 query reformulation, and so on. This framework is in•
 tended to help the user iteratively refine a vaguely un•
 derstood information need. Since the focus is on query 
 repair, the information presented is typically not docu•
 ment descriptions, but rather intermediate information 
 that indicates relationships between the query and the 
 retrieved documents. We have developed information ac•
 cess tools intended to supply some of this functionality, 
 and describe two of these here. 
   As an illustration, suppose a user is interested in med•
 ical diagnosis software. Assume that initially the user 
 has available a large, unfamiliar information source. In 
 our example, this source is the 2.2 Gigabyte TIPSTER 
 text collection [Harman, 1993]. Because the collection 
 is unfamiliar, the user will be unsure whether it contains        Figure 1: A portion of a top-level view of the Scat•

   To address this situation, we have developed a brows•
 ing method, called Scatter/Gather [Cutting et a/., 1992; 
                                                                   of the top level clusters on the TIPSTER collection.
