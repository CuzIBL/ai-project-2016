  A common approach in addressing belief revision has been 
to provide a set of rationality postulates for belief change 
functions. The AGM approach [Gardenfors, 1988] provides 
the best-known set of such postulates. The goal is to describe 
belief change at the knowledge level, that is on an abstract 
level, independent of how beliefs are represented and manip•
ulated. Belief states are modelled by sets of sentences, called 
belief sets, closed under logical consequence. K can be seen 
as a partial theory of the world. For belief set K and formula
