 1 Introduction 
There has been a long story in philosophy to find a suitable 
semantics for logics of knowledge and belief since the twen­
tieth century. The subject was picked up by researchers in 
the area of artificial intelligence, in which human reasoning 
or resource-bounded agents reasoning is considered. 
   The standard approach for characterizing knowledge and 
belief is based on the possible-worlds model. The intuitive 
                                                                 Modelling knowledge and belief of this kind yields what 
 idea, which was discovered and labelled by Hintikka [Hin-

tikka, 1962], is that an agent considers a number of situations 
                                                               presupposes that an agent's beliefs are closed under logical

  Except adopting different logic as inner logic, there is 
another significant difference between HTAL and Thijssc's 
logic. In the latter, partiality is specified by evaluation, and 
does not come from the limitation to actual belief. Its "hy­
brid" character when taken by itself is irrelevant to an aware­
ness condition. While in HTAL, the jumping-off point is in­
deed two-valued, both for inner logic and outer logic. Atoms 
are always assigned values classically. The non-classical as­
pect appears only when a belief operator occurs.
