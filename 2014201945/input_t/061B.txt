                               ABSTRACT 

     A general scheme to aid in the selection of therapies is 
described A topological sorting procedure within a general 
production rule representation is introduced The procedure 
is used to choose among competing therapies on the basis 
of precedence rules This approach has a degree of 
naturalness that lends itself to automatic explanation of the 
choices made A system has been implemented using this 
approach to develop an expert system for planning 
therapies for patients diagnosed as having ocular herpes 
simplex An abstracted example of the system s output on 
an actual case is given* 

                            I INTRODUCTION 

     Several knowledge-based programs h8ve been written 
that go beyond diagnosis and proceed to recommend 
treatments The MYCIN program [l] used a production 
rule scheme to arrive at a diagnosis However it contained 
special routines and a separate class of rules for the 
selection of potential therapies The lack of a general 
procedure severely limits attempts at automatic explanation 
of therapy The CASNET [2] program linked treatments to 
the assumed progression of the disease diagnosed 
However a clear explanation of the reasoning behind the 
choice of therapy was lacking Early work on the Digitalis 
Therapy Advisor [3] gave that program some capability for 
explanation of the chosen therapy It accomplished this by 
translating a trace of the code used More recent work on 
that subject [4] attempted to provide explanations based 
on knowledge of a consulting program generated from an 
automatic programmer An extensive domain model of 
facts about the application was required The capability to 
achieve good performance in general has not yet been 
demonstrated by an automatic programming approach 

     Most other expert consultation systems attempted to 
explain their choice of treatment in terms of a trace of the 
reasoning process -tailored to the application These 
approaches do not seem to be easily transferable to other 
domains This paper describes a procedure that integrates 
 well with a production rule scheme and has been found 
 natural for the selection of treatments and the explanation 
 of that selection
