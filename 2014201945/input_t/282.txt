                   Abstract 
    We wish to create versatile robots by using self-
    reconfiguration: hundreds of small modules au•
    tonomously organize and reorganize as geometric 
    structures to best fit the terrain on which the robot 
    has to move, the shape of the obiect the robot has 
    to manipulate, or the sensing needs for the given 
    task. Self-reconfiguration allows large collections 
    of small robots to actively organize as the most op•
    timal geometric structure to perform useful coordi•
    nated work. 
    A self-reconfiguring robot consists of a set of 
    identical modules that can dynamically and au•
    tonomously reconfigure in a variety of shapes, to 
    best fit the terrain, environment, and task. Self-
    reconfiguration leads to versatile robots that can 
    support multiple modalities of locomotion and ma•
    nipulation. Self-reconfiguring robots constitute 
    large scale distributed systems. Because the mod•
    ules change their location continuously they also 
    constitute ad-hoc networks. 
    This talk will discuss the challenges and successes 
    of creating self-reconfiguring robots, ranging from 
    designing hardware capable of self-reconfiguration 
    to developing distributed controllers and planners 
    for such systems that are scalable, adaptive, and 
    support real-time behavior.
