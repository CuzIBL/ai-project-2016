 A. McCarthy's Approach 
                                                                        achieves two goals: 1) the problem of substitution

       McCarthy begins with the simple example of Pat 
                                                                        distinct terms are never equal; and 2) we can

 toward solving this problem involves explicitly                        A.  Intensional Individuals

                                                                              There is a class of intensional individuals

concepts. Creary's extensions involve introducing                                                                                                                                                  A. Maida 383 


What does John know in each of these sentences? 
 He knows the value of some intensional individual. 
We can characterize these individuals by observ•
 ing that they each involve a two-argument rela•
 tion; namely, location-of, phone-no-of, and 
 name-of, respectively. In each case, one argument 
 is specified; namely: Irving-bee, Mike, and the 
mayor. The other argument is unspecified. We 
make the assumption that context uniquely deter•
mines the value of the unspecified argument. 
 This value is the value of the intensional expres•
 sion. The expressions themselves can now be 
 represented as: 


 B. Knowing Intensional I n d i v i d u a l s 

        Since each of these expressions has a value, 
 someone can know their values. We will express 
 this via a relation called "know-value-of" which 
 takes a cognitive agent and an intensional indi•
vidual as arguments. To represent "John knows 
Mike's phone number," we write: 

     g) (know-value-of John 
               (the (lambda (x) (phone-no-of Mike x)))) 

Observe that we treat proposition al attitudes, 
and attitudes toward intensional individuals, as 
 being relational and not as intensional operators. 
 Knowing is viewed as correct (but not necessarily 
justified) belief. 

        The meaning of "know-value-of" entails that                                  The reader should refer to the original papers, 
 if John knows the value of Mike's phone number,                                     Creary (1979) and Maida (1982), to make the proper

        Reasoning about the knowledge states of                                              To assert that two intensional individuals are

By the definition of knowing as correct belief, 
it follows that: 1) Pat knows Mike's phone number; 
and, 2) Pat knows that Mike's phone number is the 
same as Mary's phone number. From conditional 
transparency and the Axiom of Rationality, the 
conclusion follows.
