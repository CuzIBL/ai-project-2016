 2 An Interactive Japanese to English 
       Translation Method 

 An interactive machine-aided translation method was 
 introduced to support non-natives of English to write 
 English material [Muraki et a/., 1994; Yamabana et a/., 
 1997]. The target user of the method is those people 
 who have difficulty in writing down English sentences 
 directly, in spite of the fact that s/he has a basic knowl•
 edge of English to read and understand it. In this section 
 we show how the method works by an example.                                 Figure 2: Alternatives Window for ronbun
