more than one result of word identification for an input

 clear boundary between word identification and further

syntax of sentence segments may help identify words. 

 3 The Score Function 

 A score function is set up in the system. The formula 
 for the score function is based on the intuition of longest 
 Chinese words matching and taking into the considera•
 tion the frequency counts of words. The score function 
 is implemented in the augmented tests under grammar               In above, DM defines the determiner measure, INI
