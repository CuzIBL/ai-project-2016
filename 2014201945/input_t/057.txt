essary distinctions, nor abstracts away any distinctions that 
are crucial to solve the problem. Definition 3 thus formal•
izes the problem of finding qualitative values for the domains 
of variables. Compared to interchangeability, which is con•
cerned with possibilities for abstraction within a single prob•
lem instance only, a qualitative abstraction problem (QAP) 
describes a whole class of instances defined by a model re•
lation, a set of external restrictions, and the task-dependent 
distinctions. Interchangeability enforces that the set of so•
lutions remains the same as for the original model. A QAP 
generalizes (or relaxes) this basic principle and demands that 
the set of solutions remains the same but only on the level of 
target distinctions, and only for inputs on the level of observ•
able distinctions.
