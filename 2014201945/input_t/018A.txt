another perspective, if such insignificant objects and all 
the relations among them were memorized in the 
memory, the combinatorial explosion on the 
management of such relations would be unavoidable, 
because a slight change concerning to one of such 
insignificant things would cause drastic reformation. To 
put it more concretely, if a person standing in a 
situation consisting of some rocks moves toward one of 
them, it is not sufficient to make an alteration only to 
the relation between the person and the rock. All 
relations between the person and the other objects in the 
scene must also be changed, because that person surely
