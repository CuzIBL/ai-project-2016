     program.                                                         program bids the South hands): 

2) Although for any one player in the game, 
     there is an environment of imperfect 
     information, the four players between them 
     have total knowledge of any situation. 
     This leads naturally to a program based on 
     explicit reasoning about why the other 
     players react as tney do, rather than a 
     probablistic approacn. This can be 
     contrasted with games sucn as poker, where 
     not all the cards are dealt, and thus a 
     probablistic approach is necessary, even for 
     humans. In fact, an earlier program (11), 
     based on a probablistic approach, was 
     written, and found to be unsatisfactory 
     because the resulting data-structures were 
     not subtle enough to reflect the logical 
     processes needed to play a good game, and 
     because the probablistic approach severely 
     underestimated the need for a detailed plan. 
     In view of these difficuties the current 
     program, which can make explicit 
     deductions in a Conniver-like fashion, has 
     been built. 

3) Tnere is a great deal of literature on the 
     theory of bridge, and hence a wealth of 
     suggestions as to how the program should 
     work. Many of these suggestions are not in 
     an immediately useful form - for example 
     "When it is hoped to add the possibility of 
     a pseudo-squeeze to the other chances, one 
     should first casn the winners in the suit 
     where the length is visible in dummy" - but 
     they can be modified to suit our needs. 
     However, many are in an immediately useful 
      format, and can be straightway represented 
      in the program - for example "Open on 12 or 
     more points and at least four of the suit", 
     etc. 

4) The author is interested in bridge to the 
     extent of representing Essex University in 
     club competitions. 

       The last two reasons are closely connected, 
 and reflect a thesis which underlies this 


                                                               374                       General Approach 

          The program is based on two distinct but 
     closely related ideas: firstly, close 
     analysis of the bidding and the play to gain 
     information previously unknown, and secondly, 
     the utilisation of such information (and the 
     programs knowledge of the game) in the creation 
     of a plan which the program can follow. 

           In making a plan, the program will differ 
     from most game-playing programs written to date 
     (although Miller (8), Berliner and others have 
     investigated a similar approach in the case of 
     chess). The more usual tree-searching approach 
     was rejected on several grounds: 

     1) I am interested in transferring to the 
         program the knowledge gained by bridge-
         players in the past decades. The body of 
         such knowledge is vast, and to ignore it 
         seems extremely short-sighted. The author 
         is looking for an artificial intelligence 
         solution to the problem - and AI could well 
         be defined as the implementation of 
         knowledge/inference systems. It follows 
         that instead of reducing this body of 
         knowledge to a set of numbers, the author 
         wishes explicitly to reason about it. 

     2) An evaluation function in a game of imperfect 
         information would presumably return a 
         probablistic result. This makes mini-maxing 
         a complex task. One can conceive of single-
         valued evaluation functions, (such as the 
         number of tricks won plus the expected 
         number still to be won), but such functions 
         are highly artificial, and a great deal of 
         information is lost in the process. 

     3) Any tree-searching method that truncates the 
         tree (as must happen in all but a few cases 
         in the later stages of the game) can fall 
         foul of what Berliner calls the 'Horizon 
         Affect' - i.e. a false value is assigned to 
         a given move; false because of an affect 
         further down the tree, and thus invisible 
         to the routine, 

     4) If one studies the concepts used by human 
         bridge players, one finds such concepts as 
         "bid to a slam", "draw trumps", "show first-
         rouna control", "finesse the queen of clubs", 
         and so on. A successful bridge program 
         will also need to have such concepts, and 
         the author does not believe that such 
         detailed planning is possible in an 
         evaluation function. It is fairly clear, 
         however, how mini-strategies of such a 
         form can be generated by a reasoning program. 

                  Information Available 

          Probably the most important activity 
    performed by the program is the collection of 
     information about the hidden hands. There are 
     several opportunities for collecting such 
     information:

and West will nobid throughout the auction, and 
will not be considered any more in this analysis. 

      It is now Souths turn to rebid. Safelevel 
indicates the possibility of game, and trumps 
have been decided, and therefore the program 
decides that it is time to show first-round 
controls. South holds first-round control in 
three suits (diamonds, hearts and spades), and 
so he makes the lowest first-round control bid 
open to him, i.e. 3 D. 

      North responds 4 C. This is interpreted 
as showing first-round control in clubs, and 
denying first-round control in hearts - had 
he first-round control in hearts, he would have 
made the cheaper bid of 3 H. 

      South now shows his first-round control of 
hearts, by bidding 4 H. 

      North, whose bidding has so far not shown 
the power of his hand, now decides that if South, 
by himself, believes that game is on, then a 
slam is a distinct possibility. Instead of 
signing off in spades, he therefore bids 4 NT. 
This is analysed as being a Blackwood bid, asking 
for aces. The interpreting routine passes this 
message to the bid-choosing routine. 

      When South again comes to bid, it sees the 
message, and thus invokes the Blackwood routine. 
Blackwood counts the aces, finds three, and so 
returns a bid of S C. (Note for Cognescenti: 
we use Roman Blackwood). 

      North is thus assured that the partnersnip 
holds all the aces, and so asks for kings by 
bidding 5 NT. This is interpreted by BRIBIP 
as being a Blackwood bid as before. 

      Therefore, South shows the holding of one 
king, by bidding b D. 

      North can then tell that the partnership 
holds all the aces, all the kings, at the 
very least 8 of the spades, and good opportunities 
 for ruffing (for example, the clubs). He 
 therefore bids 7 S, which is passed out, and 
 can be made without difficulty. 

                    Conclusions 

      The project was started in the hope of 
obtaining some general principles of decisionâ€¢
making in environments of imperfect information. 
 To date, the only such principle found is the 
 negative one; that probablistic methods 
 are not in themselves sufficient. It was 
 hoped to keep knowledge of bridge peripheral to 
 the program, and use a general core, but it was 
 found necessary to put this knowledge in the 
 core itself. This leaves the author somewhat 
 pessimistic about the possibility of a 
 general program for decision-making.
