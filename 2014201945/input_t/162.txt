As already mentioned above, occupancy grids rest on the as•
sumption that the environment has binary structure, i.e. that 
each grid cell is either occupied or free. This assumption, 
however, is not always justified. For example, if the envi•
ronment contains a wall that is not parallel to the x- or y-
axis of the grid there must be grid cells which are only partly 
covered. In occupancy grids the probability that such cells 
are occupied will inevitably converge to one (see Figure 1). 
Coverage maps overcome this limitation by storing a poste•
rior about its coverage for each cell. Coverage values range  Equation (5) is obtained from Equation (4) by assuming that
