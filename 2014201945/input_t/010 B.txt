The interval is coded as one, if it in•

the value of the angle is 45° or 90°.

that in some sense the codes of the fi•

the succession of concavities and con•

    One more class of figures is used as 

the input objects. These figures are 

constructed like this. Some sides in a 

"right" polygon are changed to half-cir•

cles (circumferences). These half-cir•

cles are constructed on respective sides 

of the polygon, the latter being their 

diameters. The figures obtained contain 

both straight and curved sides. All the 

figures are subdivided into ranks ac•

cording to the number of their sides.
