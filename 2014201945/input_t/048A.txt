       To be more intelligent a basic decision must be 
 made: Should the missing information be requested? The 
 answer is usually no. In normal conversation informa•
 tion is omitted either because it is assumed to be pro•
 vided by the preceding or following context or because 
 it is unimportant to the conversation. The pattern-
 match routines (inside a procedure called comprehend) 
 fill in information by examining the structure of pre-
 ceding sentences. Sometimes the information in prior 
 sentences might be appropriate to later ones, and some•
 times the information given in the present sentence 
 might fill in missing arguments from previous sentences. 
 When missing arguments are noticed, an attempt is made 
 to answer the implicit question provided by their ab•
 sence through an examination of the data base. In ad•
 dition, the present input is examined to see whether it 
 can fill arguments missing in the data base being con•
 structed from the conversation. 
       So far, we have simply investigated a simple means 
 for filling out the syntactic pattern for verbs, albeit 
 with some sophistication in determining when to ask for 
 mors information. The next step is more complex. Sup•
 pose we wish to determine why someone has gone to the 
 drugstore. Again, we should not simply have to ask 
 why, but rather determine the general reasons for going 
 to the stores. For this point the comprehend routine 
 must be intelligent enough to examine a more general 
 data base. Now a fair amount of inference is required: 
 we need to match the basic paradigm with the specific 
 information given by the parsed sentence. This is not 
 easy when one considers that many different paradigms 
 will probably be stored. If the sentence had been, 
 "John went to a shoestore," then the same analysis 
 should clearly not yield the query, "What did John buy 
 at the shoestore?" The comprehend routine must be flex•
 ible enough to solve this part of the problem by itself. 
 A large amount of world knowledge is needed to solve the 
 general problem. 
       This brief analysis shows that in order to have in•
 telligent conversation it is necessary to be able to 
 generate internal questions and their answers, Whenever 
 information is missing some attempt must be made to fill 
 in the gap, sometimes by asking appropriate questions, 
 but usually by internal problem solving. In general, 
 information should not be requested by means of a ques•
 tion unless there is some actual need for it at the mo•
ment. Moreover, it would appear that the information 
 should be asked from the very highest level down. Thus, 
 the first question asked should refer to the motive and 
 results of the operations being described. Only later 
 should specific details of the method be asked. 
       In the implementation of the memory model system at 
 the time of this writing, all the levels of analysis can 
not yet be performed. Basically, the implementation is 
 complete up to the level of the sophisticated internal 
 answering of questions. Thus, it has been an easy mat•
 ter to implement a question answering routine to ask 
 questions like the following for the input sentence: 
How did John go to the drugstore? What did he do after•
wards? With whom did he go? At the moment, the basic 
routines to ask such questions as "What did he buy at 
 the drugstore?" are close to operation, but the con•
 struction of the system that can ask the question ori•
 ginally posed, "How come the first two drugstores didn't 
have what you wanted?" still remains some distance away.
