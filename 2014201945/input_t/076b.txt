to the classical backtrack algorithm for assignment 
problems, of which the Eight Queens puzzle is an 
elementary example (Fillmore & Williamson 1974, Knuth 
1975]. Experimental measurements (figure 1) reveal 
reduction by a factor of 2.5 for the 8-queens puzzle 
(factor of 8.7 for 16 queens) in T, the number of pair-tests 
performed before finding a solution (i.e., first solution). A 
pair-test in this case determines whether a queen on 

square (ij, jj) attacks a queen on square (12, j2^ in CPU" 
seconds, net speedup is by a factor of 2.0 and 6.0 for 8-
and 16-queens, respectively. 16-queens was solved in 0.14 
seconds on a PDP KL/10. The speedup can be attributed 
to the elimination of almost all redundant tests otherwise 
recomputed in many parts of the search tree, as indicated 
in figure 2, which shows the mean number of times, D, an 
arbitrary pair-test is executed. If D = 1 then all tests are 
distinct (no recomputatiOn). Note that each data point in 
the figures represents the mean over 30 or 70 problem 
instances that differ as follows: instead of instantiating 
queen 3, say, on square (3,1), then on (3,2),..., then (3,8), 
these 8 squares are ordered randomly. A problem instance 
is defined by choosing a "legal squares ordering" for each 
queen. Random ordering generally gives a smaller value of 
T, on the average, than the "natural" 1,2,3,...,N ordering (for 
20-queens, a factor of 5 00 smaller!).                                                                            REFERENCES
