provide means for the development of norm-motivated 
practical reasoning agents. This architecture is deter•
mined by two main elements: The NoA language for the 
specification of plans and norms and the NoA interpreter, 
which is capable of interpreting and executing plan and 
norm specifications formulated in the NoA language. The 
NoA architecture and the NoA specification language for 
norms and plans is influenced by systems such as Agents-
peak(L) [Rao, 1996]. There are three principal 
distinctions, however, between these systems and NoA:
