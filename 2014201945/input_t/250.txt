                        Abstract 
     This paper demonstrates the applicability of auto•
     mated reasoning to text processing, specifically to 
     Question Answering. It is shown that the approach 
     is feasible, effective, and scalable. A Logic Prover 
     has been implemented and integrated into a state-
     of-the-art Question Answering System.                                  Figure 1: COGEX Architecture

implements rewriting procedures for semantically equivalent

answers by their correctness and ultimately eliminates incor•
rect answers. In this way, the Logic Prover is a powerful tool 
in boosting the accuracy of the QA system. Moreover, the
