       Now we can describe how GPS solves Monkey and 
Bananas using the difference information in Fig•
ure 5. Suppose that in the initial state S0 the 
monkey's hand is empty and the box is not under 
the bananas. Then the largest difference, M(S0,W), 
is that the monkey's hand is empty, hence GPS 
attempts to apply Grab. But so i Sgrab, hence GPS 
sets up the subprobiem of transforming S0 into 
Sgrab, but Grab cannot be used in solving the sub-
problem because of rule S2. 

       To solve the subprobiem, GPS attempts to re•
duce the difference that the box is not under the 
bananas since this is M(so, SGrat>) • Hence, GPS 
attempts to apply Push which is not applicable, 
and the subprobiem of transforming SQ into Spush 
is generated, but S2 restricts the solution of 
this subprobiem to the operators Walk & Climb. 
The remaining part of solving this problem is 
quite straightforward and similar to the way the 
usual GPS works. 

4. Totally-Ordered Solutions 

       The above discussion raises the question, 
"Can GPS solve all problems which have a solu•
tion?" The answer is no (which can be shown 
quite easily), because'the differences, together 
with rules SI and S2, prevent GPS from looking at 
 sequences of operators that may be necessary to 
 find a solution. Hence, the question becomes, 
 "Can we somehow characterize the class of problems
