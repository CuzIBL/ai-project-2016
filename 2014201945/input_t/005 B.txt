The local choice of individual actions 
in the collective with antagonistic 
interaction may in principle lead to 
unstable, burst-like regimes in this 
collective. In the mathematical model

 characterizing the interaction in the 
collective. For this reason the cohe•
 rently local approach to the control 
 of that system necessarily forces one 
to look for local criteria of control 
which could always provide the stable 
 choice of actions (powers) by the radio-
 stations under consideration. It is a 
matter of control elasticity that leads 
 him further to the elastic local crite•
 rion of power control. This criterion 
 seems to be the most "reasonable" for 
 such a collective, but it is rather 
 complicated in realization. From the 52                                                                           Session No. 2 Applications
