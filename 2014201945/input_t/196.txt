3.1 Test Data 
Our experiments draw on 650 live-user profiles from the 
Fischlar system. In particular we make use of 5 different 
types of profile: 
  1. Explicit profiles contain explicit ratings that Fischlar 
     users have provided; 
  2. Play profiles contain only those programmes that a user 
     has played back; 
  3. Record profiles contain only those programmes that a 
     user has recorded; 
  4. Browse profiles contains only those profiles that a user 
     has browsed using Fischlar's key-frame browser; 
  5. Combined profiles are a combination of play, record and 
     browse profiles.
