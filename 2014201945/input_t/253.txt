patterns in the sub-spaces. The final classification result is 
the combination of the outputs of the dedicated classifiers. 
The S-AdaBoost Machine is made up of an AdaBoost 
divider, an AdaBoost classifier, a dedicated classifier for 
outliers, and a non-linear combiner. S-AdaBoost can 
enhance AdaBoost's capability of handling scenarios in real 
world complex environment. 

2 S-AdaBoost in Classification 

S-AdaBoost applies the Divide and Conquer Principle 
through dividing the input pattern space S into a few sub-
spaces and conquering the sub-spaces by finding simple 
fittings (decision boundaries) to the patterns in the sub-
spaces. Input space can be denoted by:
