 phrases are dealt with automatically, by ellipsis, or by the 
dropping of obvious function words. Strictly grammatical 
details are implemented automatically, such as the 
morphological distinctions between instances of the same 
relation in functionally different roles (e.g. modifier, principal 
relation, object of a predicate). 

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DESIGN: 
       Linguistically, language generation is seen as a process of 
translation from a message given in one representation - that 
of the speaking program - to the equivalent message 
 represented in English. Messages are taken as consisting of a 
set of intentional features and annotated pointers to the 
program entities the message refers to: objects, predicates, 
machine states, etc. The features encode the effects that the 
message is intended to have on its audience. Several effects 
 may be desired in the same message. For example, to "ask a 
question", "express an assumption", and "describe e relation 
from one element's point of view", ere combined in: "the red 
 block supports the green block, doesn't itr. Much of of the
