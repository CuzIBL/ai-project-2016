Thus the description of the plane has been 
compressed in the Fourier domain and is easy to 
extract by simple band pass filtering. The 
inverse transform can then reconstruct the 
image of the plane isolated from all other 
planes. A higher level program can then deduce 
the interrelationship of planes and objects.

                                                     by a binary mask, say a set of stripes, the

                                                     exactly similar to the previous discussion.

                                                     differences in any given area independent of
