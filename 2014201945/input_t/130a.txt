 framework developed in the theory makes                              Intelligence. The theory provides the 
 possible the comparison of classes of                                framework for systematic comparison of 
 algorithms which embody d i s t i n c t                              various learning algorithms. Such 
 learning strategies along a variety of                               comparisons are particularly useful in 
 dimensions. Such comparisons yield                                   determining the relative strength of

         N is the set of natural numbers. 
 We take the notions finite sequence (in 
 N) and infinite sequence (in N) to be 
 basic. The set of all finite sequences 
 is denoted: SEQ, For n £ N, and 
 infinite sequence, t: rng(t) is the set 

 of numbers appearing in t; tn is the 

 nth member of t; and tn is the finite 
 sequence of length n in t.

 list of all partial recursive functions 
 of one variable, and assume the 1 ist to

         Proposition 1 shows that text 
    efficiency is not a restrictive design 
     feature relative to the class of all 
     learning functions. In contrast, the 
    next proposition shows that text

    the class of recursive learning 
     functions.                                               Indeed, any h such that h(x) > x

 combines the virtues of text efficiency 
                                                                     S(j) < g(MS(rng(t)). To exemplify, let

 that, for any h, h-efficiency is more
