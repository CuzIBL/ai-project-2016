                    Abstract
    The temporal boundaries of many real–world
    events are inherently vague. In this paper, we dis-
    cuss the problem of qualitative temporal reasoning
    about such vague events. We show that several in-
    teresting reasoning tasks, such as checking satis-
    ﬁability, checking entailment, and calculating the
    best truth value bound, can be reduced to reasoning
    tasks in a well–known point algebra with disjunc-
    tions. Furthermore, we identify a maximal tractable Figure 1: Fuzzy set representing the time span of the Dotcom
