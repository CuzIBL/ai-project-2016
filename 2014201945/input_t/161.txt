 ceptual states of the environment (as described by the 
 robot's sensory readings: left wall, right wall, wall or 
 obstacle in front, left obstacle, right obstacle, and free

shows a simplified version of the finite state automaton. 
The memory variables were required to implement cor•

 the left, it switches automatically to the behavior "follow 
 left wall". The actual transitions between the behaviors 
"forward" and "follow left/right wall" are not exactly as 
 indicated in the figure, otherwise the robot would stay 
 following walls forever. The transition to the behavior 
"forward" is necessary, for example, in the case the robot 
is approaching an open door and the user wants the robot 
not to enter into the room. On the other hand, the robot 
"stops" whenever it perceived an obstacle in front to 
avoid collisions (not all the transitions to the behavior      Figure 2. Finite state automaton used for the control of the
