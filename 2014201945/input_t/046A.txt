We will present some general discussion on the 
organization of vision systems and then describe                            A somewhat more basic problem arises in the 
our current efforts.                                                  consideration of the following image:

volves routines at various levels, cooperating in 
an attempt to understand a scene. There is a 
large body of psychological evidence [6,32] in•
dicating the dependence of perception upon global 
information and upon preconceived ideas. Many of 
the well known optical illusions fall in this 
class. One can also show that there are simple 
scenes which are ambiguous in the absence of glo•
bal information, but are easily resolved in con•
text. 

     A most striking case of this is the ground 
plane assumption [23], which has become a corner-
stone of all robot perceptual systems. From a 
monocular image it is impossible, in general to 
calculate the distance of an object from the 
camera. If, however, the object is lying on a 
known plane (one whose transformation to image co-
ordinates is available) then the depth of the 
object1 s base vertices is known. This particular 
piece of global information has been implicitly 
used for depth information, but has many other                              The interior edges might very well be less
