                      ABSTRACT 
    A glossy highlight, viewed stereoscopically, can 
provide information about surface shape. For 
example, highlights appear to lie behind convex 
surfaces but in front of concave ones. 
    A highlight is a distorted, reflected image of a 
light source. A ray equation is developed to predict 
the stereo disparities generated when a point source 
of light is reflected in a smooth, curved surface. 
This equation can be inverted to infer surface 
curvature properties from observed stereo 
disparities of the highlight. To obtain full 
information about surface curvature in the 
neighbourhood of the highlight, stereo with two 
different baselines or stereo with motion parallax 
  is required 
    The same ray equation can also be used to 
predict the monocular appearance of a distributed 
source. A circular source, for instance, may produce 
an elliptical specular patch in an image, and the 
dimensions of the ellipse help to determine surface 
shape. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
   When the reflectance of a surface has a specular 
as well as a diffuse component, the viewer may see 
highlights. Highlights can give extra information 
about surface shape Ikeuchi [8] uses photometric 
stereo with specular surfaces to determine surface 
orientation Beck [l] notes that stereo vision might                 Figure 1: Viewing geometry. In a

   The basic principle of the surface shape

and the condition for degeneracy is that 
det(MH-/)-0. 
   The focusing effect may produce either a line or 
a blob in the image: 
  1 If the rank of (MH-1) is 1 the specularity will 
    appear in the image as a line. Or else, there 
    may be no solution for x in (7), and nothing of 
    the specularity will be visible. Stevens [13] 
    observes that, with infinitely distant source and 
    viewer, any line specularity must lie on a plane 
    curve in the surface a special cose of the 
    rank 1 focusing effect. 
  2 If the rank of MH I is zero, that is MH-/-0. 
    then either the specular reflection is invisible 
    as above, or it is focussed in 2 dimensions onto 
    the imaging aperture, and appears in the image 
    as a large bright blob 
  3 It can be shown that if the surface patch is 
    convex, the effect cannot occur This 
    corresponds to physical intuition Only concave 
    mirrors focus distant light sources

   if the source is at a finite distance L, rather 
than infinite as assumed so far, the imaging
