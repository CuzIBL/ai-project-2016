to process any dialogue of this type, 
even it has to ignore meaningfully certain 
details it cannot and should not handle. 
At the present stage the lexicon includes 
over 500 lexical entries represented in 
tree-form frames and based on a dozen of 
primitives such as want, together, real•
ize, carry out, can, and the standard 
variables for the male protagonist, the 
female protagonist and the object. The 
data base also contains a number of laws 
and regularities in the "world" of the 
dialogues such as that consummation 
 (carrying out) of love means marriage 
since the dialogues exclude pre- or extra•
marital sex. All such laws are written in 
the terms of the lexical entries and, to•
gether with them, constitute the two 
sources for the calculation of presupposi•
tion, which is already feasible in the 
system. 
     The presupposition orientation is ex•
plained both by the fact that any AI sys•
tem should "understand" more than the 
meaning proper of the sentence and, more 
importantly, by the fact that presuppo•
sition provides the system with a crite•
rion of justification for the proposed 
format of the lexical entries and the 
primitives constituting them.

experiments demonstrates that the seman•
