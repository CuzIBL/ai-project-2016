 1 Introduction 
 A problem of current focus in cognitive vision is Auto•
 matic Video Interpretation. The goal is to develop a sys•
 tematic methodology for the design, implementation and 
 integration of cognitive vision systems for recognizing 
 scenarios involved in a scene depicted by a video se•
 quence. An Automatic Video Interpretation System as 
 described in Figure 1, takes as input (1) a priori knowl•
 edge containing scenario models predefined by experts 
 and the 3D geometric and semantic information of the 
 observed environment and (2) video streams acquired by 
 the camera(s). The output of the system is the set of rec•
 ognized scenarios at each instant. In this paper, we focus 
 on the module of scenario recognition. The scenario rec•      Figure 1. Overview of an Automatic Video Interpretation System.
