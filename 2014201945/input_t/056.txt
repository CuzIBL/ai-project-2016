fact for qualitative analyses of all measured variables, yk. 
The residual (rk) for any variable is defined as the differ•
ence between the measure plant output and the nominal 
expected plant output. Since both of these are continu•
ously differentiable after the fault occurrence, and after 
each mode change, the residual can be approximated by 
the Taylor scries expansion:
