 In this section we provide preliminary definitions for concepts Example 2.1 Consider the following default theory which 
 we will be using throughout the paper.                        represents the knowledge that birds fly and penguins are birds

 The following definitions will be assumed. Let T be a propo-

 set of literals, then ->S denotes the set of all literals that are 
 the negation of some literal in S. 
   Default logic was introduced by Reiter iReiter, 1980]. A 
 propositional default theory is a pair (D, W) consisting of 
 a set W of pmpositional formulas and a set D of default rules. 
 A default rule has the form (or, equivalently
