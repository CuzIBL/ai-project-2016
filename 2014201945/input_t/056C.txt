RELAX's relative criteria for partial matching, 
cost is again measured in terms of multiple 
assignments; but since in this context conditions 
are thought of as instantiations of data 
propositions, a multiple assignment means that a 
constant in the data is the binding for more than 
one condition variable. The two instantiations 
mentioned above for (male V-NLpltcher) are equally 
good in this respect since both ALpitcher and 
ALdesighitter are bindings of only one variable; 
thus both instantiations are permitted in the 
partial match. However, any attempt to get a 
second instantiation for (male V-KLcatcher) would 
be ruled out by this new criterion. 

                       IV SOME EXAMPLES 

A. A Generalization Example 

       Fig. 2 shows the generalization problem that 
led Hayes-Roth & McDermott to be concerned with 
multiple assignments for variables. The                                        The demonstration that this partial match will

                                                                        However, there are a number of things we can say at 
     circle and one of these small figures is 
                                                                         this point to defend the view that this is the 
     inside a large triangle. 


                                                                   300  correct partial match for these examples. The fact 
 that exactly the same correspondences are obtained 
 when Example 2 is treated as the set of conditions 
 and Example 1 is treated as the data provides a 
 demonstration that RELAX at least functions as 
 Intended. However, how can correspondences such as 


 be defended? The answer to this is that there is 
 an obvious alternative to viewing Fig. 2 as two 
 examples in need of a generalization. That 
 alternative is to see Example 1 as the situation at 
 time _t1 and Example 2 as the situation at a later 
 time t2, where the task is to characterize the 
 transformation that has occurred. One 
 characterization of the transformation that changes 
 Example 1 into Example 2 is: 
      The triangle that originally contains the 
      square moves down to contain the circle. 
 The questionable correspondences mentioned above 
 have an obvious relevance for characterizing this 
 transformation.

 John R. Anderson and his collegues at CMU. As an                        was given to RELAX the results were as shown in
