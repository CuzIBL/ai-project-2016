 the classification block tried to find out 
 subsequently the possibility to use regimes 
 1-5, beginning from regime I, and adopted 
 the first of them which provided successful 
 overcoming the cleft. 
      Such an approach is evidently appli•
 cable to designing reasonable methods of 
 overcoming other types of obstacles. It 
 should be noted that for a pit rather deep, 
 or for a boulder rather high, or for an ob•
 stacle like the one in Fig. 10 it may be ne•
 cessary to tilt the body of the walker and 
 change its pitch angle in an appropriate way 
 as a function of time (Fig. 9, 10). It is 
 evident that when analysing the obstacle, 
 this regime, as the most complicated one, 
 has to be tested in the last turn. 
       Some problems connected with measure•
 ments were investigated: measurement data 
 processing, obstacle identification, measu•
