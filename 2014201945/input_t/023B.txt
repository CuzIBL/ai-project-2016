adverbial modifiers, however, clearly require 
systematic analysis; "quickly" is a good example. 
This term appears to sa               something about the speed 
of an action or act vity, comparing it to some 
standard. An adequate meaning representation for 
"quickly" should speii this out precisely. 
    Bartsch and Vennemann suggest that adverbial 
modifiers operate on verb meanings in the same 
manner that adjectival modifiers operate on noun 
meanings, i.e. they have semantic representations 
with functions f such that f is applied to term x 
to map x onto a new term f(x). One problem in this 
approach is illustrated by the following example. 

                  John owns a large car. 
                  John is running quickly. 

Whereas large in [5) has as a reference set the set 
of cars, and John s car is large in relation to the 
"average" for that set. "running quickly" cannot be 
analyzed so easily. if the analogy were perfect 
then the reference set operated on by "quickly" 
would be the set of "runnings" (whatever that 
means); but clearly this set of runnings must be 
further restricted to the set of runnings John is 
capable of performing. Thus "quickly" appears to 
operate not on "running" alone, but on "John 
running". As further examples consider (7) and {8}. 

            The cheetah is running quickly. 
            The ant is running quickly. 
Clearly "quickly" here operates on "running ant" 
and "running cheetah" respectively. 
     Hence the nature of the "runner" can narrow the 
reference set to which we apply a measure function. 
In [6} "quickly" modifies running with respect tu 
John s runnings, or, if we don t know John, at 
least to human runnings (assuming that John is 
numan). In (7) and {8} the measure function is 
applied to the runnings of cheetahs and ants 
respectively. Unfortunately factors other than the 
identity or category of the runner can also affect 
the meaning of "quickly", as shown by (9) to {13h 

John is running quickly on his hands and knees. {9} 
John is running quickly on the moon. {10} 
John is running quickly in Chile. {11} {12N 
The cheetah is running quickly in the dense forest1. 
The cheetah is running quickly on the plain. {13} 
The effect of locale on the meaning of "quickly" is 
seen in the contrast between {107 and {11} and 
between {12} and {13}. 
     Consequently it appears that the context which 
determines the meaning of an adverbial modifier 
can t be circumscribed once and for all. Adverbials 
must be allowed to interact with any specific and 
  eneral knowledge available about the participants 
f;n  (and setting- of) an action. Zadeh 's (1972) 
treatment of adverbial "hedges" lacks generality 
since he specifies (weighted) components of each 
fuzzy term on which a hedge may operate once and 
for all prior to using a particular "hedge". Thus 
we diagram {7}, without the adverb, as Fig. 7; (a) 
and (b) are based on alternative (but equivalent) 
representations of definite descriptions. Fig. 8 
illustrates the adverbial construction, in {12} 
consistent with Bartsch and Vennemann s general 
approach, but takes into account the above 
considerations. In Fig. 8 the relationship is made 
explicit between the speed of the cheetah s running 
and the typical value of speed for something that 
is running, a cheetah, and in dense forests. 

     Note that the set of cheetahs running in dense 
forests, required for comparison, may well be empty 
 (if not, replace "dense forest" with "deep snow"). 
The "reference set" therefore, if it exists at all. 
is not of this world but of some imaginary world 
which is our conception of how hard cheetahs would 
find the Roing if they were to run through forests 
 (or snow). In our formulation we have applied the
