3 Permutation Channels 
A common form of redundant modelling is when we con•
sider two viewpoints to a permutation problem. We can 
view the problem as finding a bipartite matching between 
two sets of objects of the same size. For notational conve•
nience, let the two viewpoints as having the set of variables 
                    and V = respectively. 
   The permutation channel is defined by the conjunction 
of constraints The permuta-
