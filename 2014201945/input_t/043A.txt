306 Distributed Al is constituted from cases derived from episodes. That 
is, each episode has the potential to contribute new 
components and detail to the history of interactions, a 
process called the enrichment of the multicase. 
   We define a decision point (DP) as any point in a 
routine requiring selection among alternatives, such as 
branch points, projections of events, and parameter 
bindings. A multicase organizes a set of decision points 
into a directed graph. 
   Each decision point contains the knowledge relevant 
to making a single decision, represented in terms of 
cases. A DP specifies the known options at that point 
(GET-COPY-CARD, CHECK-POWER), associating 
with each option a set of descriptors of situations in 
which it is considered appropriate. Each descriptor 
represents one segment of some particular problem-
solving episode; it describes that segment of experi•
ence by specifying a set of features and value available 
to the agent at that particular point in the interaction. 
It is because the descriptors are tied to features of the 
environment that the routine becomes grounded in the 
agent's individual world and, over time, habitats can          Figure 1: Decision Points Collect Together Related
