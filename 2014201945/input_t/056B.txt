of the syntactic analysis, each tense and each ex•
plicit time expression is identified and associated 
with the unit that it modifies. The output of the 
syntactic processing is thus a sequence of events 
with associated time information, connected by bi•
nary connectives. The time algorithm operates se•
quentially on the set of connected events obtained 
for a document; it starts at the beginning of the 
narrative and assigns to each event a time in terms 
of an already processed event, before going on to 
the next event. 

     The emphasis in developing this algorithm has 
been to use the available syntactic information to 
its fullest. We have not explored the question of 
whether the incorporation of domain-specific 
extra-linguistic knowledge would improve the pro•
cessing of time (it almost certainly would), and 
whether the kinds of extra-linguistic knowledge 
needed to do this can be clearly delimited (a dif•
ficult task). It is our hope that the full utili•
