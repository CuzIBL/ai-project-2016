complex concepts requires quantifiers ("At all

definite descriptions of sets require quantifiers 
 ("the people of Canada") . 
        Yet the treatment of quantifiers in semantic-
nets has generally been rether cursory. Often 
quantifiers ar regarded as monadic modifiers of                                      (Ex) (dog (x) => (Ey)[cat(y) Echase(x,y) ]) ,

of that item (i.e., set cardinality). Universal                               Skolemized. Now if we can assume (Ey)cat(y), i.e.,

even though the logica! operator A ("for all") is                             there is at least one dog), then this becomes 
not at all indicative of cardinality. The only                                         cat (f(x)) ε [dog(x) => cha se (x, f (x) ) ]

of proocrty-^tructures. In. that approach appropriate for encoding natural language 
quantifiers are attached singly or in pairs to                                statements, since we do not usually communicate in 
predicates, e.g., to syrbolize a tranrfcrmation                               terms of propositions which are trivially true by

deficient implicative nctation. One way of the assumption that there is at least one moment 
characterizing the difficulty is that there is no                             of time. Note that a time argument has been added 
apparent method for distinguishing definite and 
indefinite set descriptions, such as "the set of 
all degs that chase cats" versus "a set of dogs 
that chase cats", and hence no way of 
distinguishing statements involving such 
descriptions antecedently. Second, the rule that 
quantifiers in the subject position of the 
propositional tree have the largest scope leads to 
difficulties. In particular, it is awkward to 
raise a propositional object to the level of 
maximum scope, as Anders or. ε Bower are well aware. 
For example, they are forced to render "There is a                            to the predicate "at". The representation reems a 
cat that all dogs chase" as "There is a cat                                   little ur.natural because of the reed to restrict

subject position. Additional problems are that it would be more natural to use a many-sorted

Anderson ε Bower's notation the "time context"                                restricted to a particular subdomain of the domain 
includes an entire proposition in its scope. For                              of discourse, and with time forming a distinct 
example, there is no direct way to handle the                                 sort. Then guantificaticn over a time argument

Finally Anderson ε Dower neglect to suppiy nominally. Sortal distinctions could be made

shall leave sortal distinctions implicit, except 
in the case of tiee. Time calls for special 
treatment because of its central importance in 
structuring events. I will use pairs of 
parentheses instead of circles for moments of time 
and mark pointers to morcnts of tine "T". A name 
for a moment of time can be placed between the 
parentheses. Broken parentheses i ndicate 
universally quantified time variables. With these

simplified further with the aid of two additional 
conventions. The first is to place the time at 
which a proposition hclds directly alongside the 
predicate token of that proposition, as in                                   Here I shculd renark that past claims about

time arguments (an some suitable sense of interval                    net notation to second (or higher) order logic

 as a relation between adjacent time intervals, and

 intervals of time. For complete sets of time
