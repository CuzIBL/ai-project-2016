 There are (at least) two possible definitions for regression, 
 each of which corresponds to a given need: deductive re•
 gression (also referred to as temporal explanation or weak 
preimage) and abductive regression (also referred to as strong 
preimage).                                                       Thus, abductive regression amounts to finding the set of

   This characterization helps understanding deductive re•
gression: it intuitively means that we are interested in find•
ing the set of states which could be possible states before the 
action, knowing that holds after the action. This type of 
regression is useful for postdiction, i.e., reasoning about the 
past state of the system. 
   Since deductive regression is expressed as a deduction 
problem, its complexity is easy to find out.
